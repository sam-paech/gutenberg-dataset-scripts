  "John Buchan -- The Thirty-Nine Steps": [
    "I returned from the City about three o\u2019clock on that May afternoon pretty well disgusted with life. I had been three months in the Old Country, and was fed up with it. If anyone had told me a year ago that I would have been feeling like that I should have laughed at him; but there was the fact. The weather made me liverish, the talk of the ordinary Englishman made me sick. I couldn\u2019t get enough exercise, and the amusements of London seemed as flat as soda-water that has been standing in the sun. \u201cRichard Hannay,\u201d I kept telling myself, \u201cyou have got into the wrong ditch, my friend, and you had better climb out.\u201d\n\nIt made me bite my lips to think of the plans I had been building up those last years in Buluwayo. I had got my pile\u2014not one of the big ones, but good enough for me; and I had figured out all kinds of ways of enjoying myself. My father had brought me out from Scotland at the age of six, and I had never been home since; so England was a sort of Arabian Nights to me, and I counted on stopping there for the rest of my days.\n\nBut from the first I was disappointed with it. In about a week I was tired of seeing sights, and in less than a month I had had enough of restaurants and theatres and race-meetings. I had no real pal to go about with, which probably explains things. Plenty of people invited me to their houses, but they didn\u2019t seem much interested in me. They would fling me a question or two about South Africa, and then get on to their own affairs. A lot of Imperialist ladies asked me to tea to meet schoolmasters from New Zealand and editors from Vancouver, and that was the dismalest business of all. Here was I, thirty-seven years old, sound in wind and limb, with enough money to have a good time, yawning my head off all day. I had just about settled to clear out and get back to the veld, for I was the best bored man in the United Kingdom.\n\nThat afternoon I had been worrying my brokers about investments to give my mind something to work on, and on my way home I turned into my club\u2014rather a pot-house, which took in Colonial members. I had a long drink, and read the evening papers. They were full of the row in the Near East, and there was an article about Karolides, the Greek Premier. I rather fancied the chap. From all accounts he seemed the one big man in the show; and he played a straight game too, which was more than could be said for most of them. I gathered that they hated him pretty blackly in Berlin and Vienna, but that we were going to stick by him, and one paper said that he was the only barrier between Europe and Armageddon. I remember wondering if I could get a job in those parts. It struck me that Albania was the sort of place that might keep a man from yawning.\n\nAbout six o\u2019clock I went home, dressed, dined at the Caf\u00e9 Royal, and turned into a music-hall. It was a silly show, all capering women and monkey-faced men, and I did not stay long. The night was fine and clear as I walked back to the flat I had hired near Portland Place. The crowd surged past me on the pavements, busy and chattering, and I envied the people for having something to do. These shop-girls and clerks and dandies and policemen had some interest in life that kept them going. I gave half-a-crown to a beggar because I saw him yawn; he was a fellow-sufferer. At Oxford Circus I looked up into the spring sky and I made a vow. I would give the Old Country another day to fit me into something; if nothing happened, I would take the next boat for the Cape.\n\nMy flat was the first floor in a new block behind Langham Place. There was a common staircase, with a porter and a liftman at the entrance, but there was no restaurant or anything of that sort, and each flat was quite shut off from the others. I hate servants on the premises, so I had a fellow to look after me who came in by the day. He arrived before eight o\u2019clock every morning and used to depart at seven, for I never dined at home.\n\nI was just fitting my key into the door when I noticed a man at my elbow. I had not seen him approach, and the sudden appearance made me start. He was a slim man, with a short brown beard and small, gimlety blue eyes. I recognized him as the occupant of a flat on the top floor, with whom I had passed the time of day on the stairs.\n\n\u201cCan I speak to you?\u201d he said. \u201cMay I come in for a minute?\u201d He was steadying his voice with an effort, and his hand was pawing my arm.\n\nI got my door open and motioned him in. No sooner was he over the threshold than he made a dash for my back room, where I used to smoke and write my letters. Then he bolted back.\n\n\u201cIs the door locked?\u201d he asked feverishly, and he fastened the chain with his own hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d he said humbly. \u201cIt\u2019s a mighty liberty, but you looked the kind of man who would understand. I\u2019ve had you in my mind all this week when things got troublesome. Say, will you do me a good turn?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll listen to you,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ll promise.\u201d I was getting worried by the antics of this nervous little chap.\n\nThere was a tray of drinks on a table beside him, from which he filled himself a stiff whisky-and-soda. He drank it off in three gulps, and cracked the glass as he set it down.\n\n\u201cPardon,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m a bit rattled tonight. You see, I happen at this moment to be dead.\u201d",
    "\u201cSay, Hannay,\u201d he said, \u201cI judge I should let you a bit deeper into this business. I should hate to go out without leaving somebody else to put up a fight.\u201d And he began to tell me in detail what I had only heard from him vaguely.\n\nI did not give him very close attention. The fact is, I was more interested in his own adventures than in his high politics. I reckoned that Karolides and his affairs were not my business, leaving all that to him. So a lot that he said slipped clean out of my memory. I remember that he was very clear that the danger to Karolides would not begin till he had got to London, and would come from the very highest quarters, where there would be no thought of suspicion. He mentioned the name of a woman\u2014Julia Czechenyi\u2014as having something to do with the danger. She would be the decoy, I gathered, to get Karolides out of the care of his guards. He talked, too, about a Black Stone and a man that lisped in his speech, and he described very particularly somebody that he never referred to without a shudder\u2014an old man with a young voice who could hood his eyes like a hawk.\n\nHe spoke a good deal about death, too. He was mortally anxious about winning through with his job, but he didn\u2019t care a rush for his life.\n\n\u201cI reckon it\u2019s like going to sleep when you are pretty well tired out, and waking to find a summer day with the scent of hay coming in at the window. I used to thank God for such mornings way back in the Blue-Grass country, and I guess I\u2019ll thank Him when I wake up on the other side of Jordan.\u201d",
    "My plan had been to get out at some station down the line, but the train suddenly gave me a better chance, for it came to a standstill at the end of a culvert which spanned a brawling porter-coloured river. I looked out and saw that every carriage window was closed and no human figure appeared in the landscape. So I opened the door, and dropped quickly into the tangle of hazels which edged the line.\n\nIt would have been all right but for that infernal dog. Under the impression that I was decamping with its master\u2019s belongings, it started to bark, and all but got me by the trousers. This woke up the herd, who stood bawling at the carriage door in the belief that I had committed suicide. I crawled through the thicket, reached the edge of the stream, and in cover of the bushes put a hundred yards or so behind me. Then from my shelter I peered back, and saw the guard and several passengers gathered round the open carriage door and staring in my direction. I could not have made a more public departure if I had left with a bugler and a brass band.\n\nHappily the drunken herd provided a diversion. He and his dog, which was attached by a rope to his waist, suddenly cascaded out of the carriage, landed on their heads on the track, and rolled some way down the bank towards the water. In the rescue which followed the dog bit somebody, for I could hear the sound of hard swearing. Presently they had forgotten me, and when after a quarter of a mile\u2019s crawl I ventured to look back, the train had started again and was vanishing in the cutting.\n\nI was in a wide semicircle of moorland, with the brown river as radius, and the high hills forming the northern circumference. There was not a sign or sound of a human being, only the plashing water and the interminable crying of curlews. Yet, oddly enough, for the first time I felt the terror of the hunted on me. It was not the police that I thought of, but the other folk, who knew that I knew Scudder\u2019s secret and dared not let me live. I was certain that they would pursue me with a keenness and vigilance unknown to the British law, and that once their grip closed on me I should find no mercy.\n\nI looked back, but there was nothing in the landscape. The sun glinted on the metals of the line and the wet stones in the stream, and you could not have found a more peaceful sight in the world. Nevertheless I started to run. Crouching low in the runnels of the bog, I ran till the sweat blinded my eyes. The mood did not leave me till I had reached the rim of mountain and flung myself panting on a ridge high above the young waters of the brown river.\n\nFrom my vantage-ground I could scan the whole moor right away to the railway line and to the south of it where green fields took the place of heather. I have eyes like a hawk, but I could see nothing moving in the whole countryside. Then I looked east beyond the ridge and saw a new kind of landscape\u2014shallow green valleys with plentiful fir plantations and the faint lines of dust which spoke of highroads. Last of all I looked into the blue May sky, and there I saw that which set my pulses racing....\n\nLow down in the south a monoplane was climbing into the heavens. I was as certain as if I had been told that that aeroplane was looking for me, and that it did not belong to the police. For an hour or two I watched it from a pit of heather. It flew low along the hill-tops, and then in narrow circles over the valley up which I had come. Then it seemed to change its mind, rose to a great height, and flew away back to the south.\n\nI did not like this espionage from the air, and I began to think less well of the countryside I had chosen for a refuge. These heather hills were no sort of cover if my enemies were in the sky, and I must find a different kind of sanctuary. I looked with more satisfaction to the green country beyond the ridge, for there I should find woods and stone houses.\n\nAbout six in the evening I came out of the moorland to a white ribbon of road which wound up the narrow vale of a lowland stream. As I followed it, fields gave place to bent, the glen became a plateau, and presently I had reached a kind of pass where a solitary house smoked in the twilight. The road swung over a bridge, and leaning on the parapet was a young man.\n\nHe was smoking a long clay pipe and studying the water with spectacled eyes. In his left hand was a small book with a finger marking the place. Slowly he repeated\u2014\n\nAs when a Gryphon through the wilderness\nWith wing\u00e8d step, o\u2019er hill and moory dale\nPursues the Arimaspian.\n\nHe jumped round as my step rung on the keystone, and I saw a pleasant sunburnt boyish face.\n\n\u201cGood evening to you,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine night for the road.\u201d\n\nThe smell of peat smoke and of some savoury roast floated to me from the house.\n\n\u201cIs that place an inn?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAt your service,\u201d he said politely. \u201cI am the landlord, sir, and I hope you will stay the night, for to tell you the truth I have had no company for a week.\u201d\n\nI pulled myself up on the parapet of the bridge and filled my pipe. I began to detect an ally.",
    "In half an hour I was reading with a whitish face and fingers that drummed on the table. I glanced out of the window and saw a big touring-car coming up the glen towards the inn. It drew up at the door, and there was the sound of people alighting. There seemed to be two of them, men in aquascutums and tweed caps.\n\nTen minutes later the innkeeper slipped into the room, his eyes bright with excitement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two chaps below looking for you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThey\u2019re in the dining-room having whiskies-and-sodas. They asked about you and said they had hoped to meet you here. Oh! and they described you jolly well, down to your boots and shirt. I told them you had been here last night and had gone off on a motor bicycle this morning, and one of the chaps swore like a navvy.\u201d\n\nI made him tell me what they looked like. One was a dark-eyed thin fellow with bushy eyebrows, the other was always smiling and lisped in his talk. Neither was any kind of foreigner; on this my young friend was positive.\n\nI took a bit of paper and wrote these words in German as if they were part of a letter\u2014\n\n... \u201cBlack Stone. Scudder had got on to this, but he could not act for a fortnight. I doubt if I can do any good now, especially as Karolides is uncertain about his plans. But if Mr T. advises I will do the best I....\u201d\n\n\nI manufactured it rather neatly, so that it looked like a loose page of a private letter.\n\n\u201cTake this down and say it was found in my bedroom, and ask them to return it to me if they overtake me.\u201d\n\nThree minutes later I heard the car begin to move, and peeping from behind the curtain caught sight of the two figures. One was slim, the other was sleek; that was the most I could make of my reconnaissance.\n\nThe innkeeper appeared in great excitement. \u201cYour paper woke them up,\u201d he said gleefully. \u201cThe dark fellow went as white as death and cursed like blazes, and the fat one whistled and looked ugly. They paid for their drinks with half-a-sovereign and wouldn\u2019t wait for change.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019ll tell you what I want you to do,\u201d I said. \u201cGet on your bicycle and go off to Newton-Stewart to the Chief Constable. Describe the two men, and say you suspect them of having had something to do with the London murder. You can invent reasons. The two will come back, never fear. Not tonight, for they\u2019ll follow me forty miles along the road, but first thing tomorrow morning. Tell the police to be here bright and early.\u201d\n\nHe set off like a docile child, while I worked at Scudder\u2019s notes. When he came back we dined together, and in common decency I had to let him pump me. I gave him a lot of stuff about lion hunts and the Matabele War, thinking all the while what tame businesses these were compared to this I was now engaged in! When he went to bed I sat up and finished Scudder. I smoked in a chair till daylight, for I could not sleep.\n\nAbout eight next morning I witnessed the arrival of two constables and a sergeant. They put their car in a coach-house under the innkeeper\u2019s instructions, and entered the house. Twenty minutes later I saw from my window a second car come across the plateau from the opposite direction. It did not come up to the inn, but stopped two hundred yards off in the shelter of a patch of wood. I noticed that its occupants carefully reversed it before leaving it. A minute or two later I heard their steps on the gravel outside the window.\n\nMy plan had been to lie hid in my bedroom, and see what happened. I had a notion that, if I could bring the police and my other more dangerous pursuers together, something might work out of it to my advantage. But now I had a better idea. I scribbled a line of thanks to my host, opened the window, and dropped quietly into a gooseberry bush. Unobserved I crossed the dyke, crawled down the side of a tributary burn, and won the highroad on the far side of the patch of trees. There stood the car, very spick and span in the morning sunlight, but with the dust on her which told of a long journey. I started her, jumped into the chauffeur\u2019s seat, and stole gently out on to the plateau.\n\nAlmost at once the road dipped so that I lost sight of the inn, but the wind seemed to bring me the sound of angry voices.",
    "Then in a tiny bight of road, beside a heap of stones, I found the roadman.\n\nHe had just arrived, and was wearily flinging down his hammer. He looked at me with a fishy eye and yawned.\n\n\u201cConfoond the day I ever left the herdin\u2019!\u201d he said, as if to the world at large. \u201cThere I was my ain maister. Now I\u2019m a slave to the Goavernment, tethered to the roadside, wi\u2019 sair een, and a back like a suckle.\u201d\n\nHe took up the hammer, struck a stone, dropped the implement with an oath, and put both hands to his ears. \u201cMercy on me! My heid\u2019s burstin\u2019!\u201d he cried.\n\nHe was a wild figure, about my own size but much bent, with a week\u2019s beard on his chin, and a pair of big horn spectacles.\n\n\u201cI canna dae\u2019t,\u201d he cried again. \u201cThe Surveyor maun just report me. I\u2019m for my bed.\u201d\n\nI asked him what was the trouble, though indeed that was clear enough.\n\n\u201cThe trouble is that I\u2019m no sober. Last nicht my dochter Merran was waddit, and they danced till fower in the byre. Me and some ither chiels sat down to the drinkin\u2019, and here I am. Peety that I ever lookit on the wine when it was red!\u201d\n\nI agreed with him about bed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy speakin\u2019,\u201d he moaned. \u201cBut I got a postcard yestreen sayin\u2019 that the new Road Surveyor would be round the day. He\u2019ll come and he\u2019ll no find me, or else he\u2019ll find me fou, and either way I\u2019m a done man. I\u2019ll awa\u2019 back to my bed and say I\u2019m no weel, but I doot that\u2019ll no help me, for they ken my kind o\u2019 no-weel-ness.\u201d\n\nThen I had an inspiration. \u201cDoes the new Surveyor know you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo him. He\u2019s just been a week at the job. He rins about in a wee motor-cawr, and wad speir the inside oot o\u2019 a whelk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your house?\u201d I asked, and was directed by a wavering finger to the cottage by the stream.\n\n\u201cWell, back to your bed,\u201d I said, \u201cand sleep in peace. I\u2019ll take on your job for a bit and see the Surveyor.\u201d\n\nHe stared at me blankly; then, as the notion dawned on his fuddled brain, his face broke into the vacant drunkard\u2019s smile.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the billy,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019ll be easy eneuch managed. I\u2019ve finished that bing o\u2019 stanes, so you needna chap ony mair this forenoon. Just take the barry, and wheel eneuch metal frae yon quarry doon the road to mak anither bing the morn. My name\u2019s Alexander Trummle, and I\u2019ve been seeven year at the trade, and twenty afore that herdin\u2019 on Leithen Water. My freens ca\u2019 me Ecky, and whiles Specky, for I wear glesses, being waik i\u2019 the sicht. Just you speak the Surveyor fair, and ca\u2019 him Sir, and he\u2019ll be fell pleased. I\u2019ll be back or midday.\u201d\n\nI borrowed his spectacles and filthy old hat; stripped off coat, waistcoat, and collar, and gave him them to carry home; borrowed, too, the foul stump of a clay pipe as an extra property. He indicated my simple tasks, and without more ado set off at an amble bedwards. Bed may have been his chief object, but I think there was also something left in the foot of a bottle. I prayed that he might be safe under cover before my friends arrived on the scene.\n\nThen I set to work to dress for the part. I opened the collar of my shirt\u2014it was a vulgar blue-and-white check such as ploughmen wear\u2014and revealed a neck as brown as any tinker\u2019s. I rolled up my sleeves, and there was a forearm which might have been a blacksmith\u2019s, sunburnt and rough with old scars. I got my boots and trouser-legs all white from the dust of the road, and hitched up my trousers, tying them with string below the knee. Then I set to work on my face. With a handful of dust I made a water-mark round my neck, the place where Mr Turnbull\u2019s Sunday ablutions might be expected to stop. I rubbed a good deal of dirt also into the sunburn of my cheeks. A roadman\u2019s eyes would no doubt be a little inflamed, so I contrived to get some dust in both of mine, and by dint of vigorous rubbing produced a bleary effect.\n\nThe sandwiches Sir Harry had given me had gone off with my coat, but the roadman\u2019s lunch, tied up in a red handkerchief, was at my disposal. I ate with great relish several of the thick slabs of scone and cheese and drank a little of the cold tea. In the handkerchief was a local paper tied with string and addressed to Mr Turnbull\u2014obviously meant to solace his midday leisure. I did up the bundle again, and put the paper conspicuously beside it.\n\nMy boots did not satisfy me, but by dint of kicking among the stones I reduced them to the granite-like surface which marks a roadman\u2019s footgear. Then I bit and scraped my finger-nails till the edges were all cracked and uneven. The men I was matched against would miss no detail. I broke one of the bootlaces and retied it in a clumsy knot, and loosed the other so that my thick grey socks bulged over the uppers. Still no sign of anything on the road. The motor I had observed half an hour ago must have gone home.\n\nMy toilet complete, I took up the barrow and began my journeys to and from the quarry a hundred yards off. I remember an old scout in Rhodesia, who had done many queer things in his day, once telling me that the secret of playing a part was to think yourself into it. You could never keep it up, he said, unless you could manage to convince yourself that you were _it_. So I shut off all other thoughts and switched them on to the road-mending. I thought of the little white cottage as my home, I recalled the years I had spent herding on Leithen Water, I made my mind dwell lovingly on sleep in a box-bed and a bottle of cheap whisky. Still nothing appeared on that long white road. Now and then a sheep wandered off the heather to stare at me. A heron flopped down to a pool in the stream and started to fish, taking no more notice of me than if I had been a milestone. On I went, trundling my loads of stone, with the heavy step of the professional. Soon I grew warm, and the dust on my face changed into solid and abiding grit. I was already counting the hours till evening should put a limit to Mr Turnbull\u2019s monotonous toil.",
    "I stalked over the border of coarse hill gravel and entered the open veranda door. Within was a pleasant room, glass on one side, and on the other a mass of books. More books showed in an inner room. On the floor, instead of tables, stood cases such as you see in a museum, filled with coins and queer stone implements.\n\nThere was a knee-hole desk in the middle, and seated at it, with some papers and open volumes before him, was the benevolent old gentleman. His face was round and shiny, like Mr Pickwick\u2019s, big glasses were stuck on the end of his nose, and the top of his head was as bright and bare as a glass bottle. He never moved when I entered, but raised his placid eyebrows and waited on me to speak.\n\nIt was not an easy job, with about five minutes to spare, to tell a stranger who I was and what I wanted, and to win his aid. I did not attempt it. There was something about the eye of the man before me, something so keen and knowledgeable, that I could not find a word. I simply stared at him and stuttered.\n\n\u201cYou seem in a hurry, my friend,\u201d he said slowly.\n\nI nodded towards the window. It gave a prospect across the moor through a gap in the plantation, and revealed certain figures half a mile off straggling through the heather.\n\n\u201cAh, I see,\u201d he said, and took up a pair of field-glasses through which he patiently scrutinized the figures.\n\n\u201cA fugitive from justice, eh? Well, we\u2019ll go into the matter at our leisure. Meantime I object to my privacy being broken in upon by the clumsy rural policeman. Go into my study, and you will see two doors facing you. Take the one on the left and close it behind you. You will be perfectly safe.\u201d\n\nAnd this extraordinary man took up his pen again.\n\nI did as I was bid, and found myself in a little dark chamber which smelt of chemicals, and was lit only by a tiny window high up in the wall. The door had swung behind me with a click like the door of a safe. Once again I had found an unexpected sanctuary.\n\nAll the same I was not comfortable. There was something about the old gentleman which puzzled and rather terrified me. He had been too easy and ready, almost as if he had expected me. And his eyes had been horribly intelligent.\n\nNo sound came to me in that dark place. For all I knew the police might be searching the house, and if they did they would want to know what was behind this door. I tried to possess my soul in patience, and to forget how hungry I was.\n\nThen I took a more cheerful view. The old gentleman could scarcely refuse me a meal, and I fell to reconstructing my breakfast. Bacon and eggs would content me, but I wanted the better part of a flitch of bacon and half a hundred eggs. And then, while my mouth was watering in anticipation, there was a click and the door stood open.\n\nI emerged into the sunlight to find the master of the house sitting in a deep armchair in the room he called his study, and regarding me with curious eyes.\n\n\u201cHave they gone?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThey have gone. I convinced them that you had crossed the hill. I do not choose that the police should come between me and one whom I am delighted to honour. This is a lucky morning for you, Mr Richard Hannay.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke his eyelids seemed to tremble and to fall a little over his keen grey eyes. In a flash the phrase of Scudder\u2019s came back to me, when he had described the man he most dreaded in the world. He had said that he \u201ccould hood his eyes like a hawk\u201d. Then I saw that I had walked straight into the enemy\u2019s headquarters.\n\nMy first impulse was to throttle the old ruffian and make for the open air. He seemed to anticipate my intention, for he smiled gently, and nodded to the door behind me. I turned, and saw two men-servants who had me covered with pistols.\n\nHe knew my name, but he had never seen me before. And as the reflection darted across my mind I saw a slender chance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d I said roughly. \u201cAnd who are you calling Richard Hannay? My name\u2019s Ainslie.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d he said, still smiling. \u201cBut of course you have others. We won\u2019t quarrel about a name.\u201d\n\nI was pulling myself together now, and I reflected that my garb, lacking coat and waistcoat and collar, would at any rate not betray me. I put on my surliest face and shrugged my shoulders.\n\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to give me up after all, and I call it a damned dirty trick. My God, I wish I had never seen that cursed motor-car! Here\u2019s the money and be damned to you,\u201d and I flung four sovereigns on the table.\n\nHe opened his eyes a little. \u201cOh no, I shall not give you up. My friends and I will have a little private settlement with you, that is all. You know a little too much, Mr Hannay. You are a clever actor, but not quite clever enough.\u201d\n\nHe spoke with assurance, but I could see the dawning of a doubt in his mind.\n\n\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake stop jawing,\u201d I cried. \u201cEverything\u2019s against me. I haven\u2019",
    "The storeroom was a damp chamber in what had been the old farmhouse. There was no carpet on the uneven floor, and nothing to sit down on but a school form. It was black as pitch, for the windows were heavily shuttered. I made out by groping that the walls were lined with boxes and barrels and sacks of some heavy stuff. The whole place smelt of mould and disuse. My gaolers turned the key in the door, and I could hear them shifting their feet as they stood on guard outside.\n\nI sat down in that chilly darkness in a very miserable frame of mind. The old boy had gone off in a motor to collect the two ruffians who had interviewed me yesterday. Now, they had seen me as the roadman, and they would remember me, for I was in the same rig. What was a roadman doing twenty miles from his beat, pursued by the police? A question or two would put them on the track. Probably they had seen Mr Turnbull, probably Marmie too; most likely they could link me up with Sir Harry, and then the whole thing would be crystal clear. What chance had I in this moorland house with three desperadoes and their armed servants?\n\nI began to think wistfully of the police, now plodding over the hills after my wraith. They at any rate were fellow-countrymen and honest men, and their tender mercies would be kinder than these ghoulish aliens. But they wouldn\u2019t have listened to me. That old devil with the eyelids had not taken long to get rid of them. I thought he probably had some kind of graft with the constabulary. Most likely he had letters from Cabinet Ministers saying he was to be given every facility for plotting against Britain. That\u2019s the sort of owlish way we run our politics in this jolly old country.\n\nThe three would be back for lunch, so I hadn\u2019t more than a couple of hours to wait. It was simply waiting on destruction, for I could see no way out of this mess. I wished that I had Scudder\u2019s courage, for I am free to confess I didn\u2019t feel any great fortitude. The only thing that kept me going was that I was pretty furious. It made me boil with rage to think of those three spies getting the pull on me like this. I hoped that at any rate I might be able to twist one of their necks before they downed me.\n\nThe more I thought of it the angrier I grew, and I had to get up and move about the room. I tried the shutters, but they were the kind that lock with a key, and I couldn\u2019t move them. From the outside came the faint clucking of hens in the warm sun. Then I groped among the sacks and boxes. I couldn\u2019t open the latter, and the sacks seemed to be full of things like dog-biscuits that smelt of cinnamon. But, as I circumnavigated the room, I found a handle in the wall which seemed worth investigating.\n\nIt was the door of a wall cupboard\u2014what they call a \u201cpress\u201d in Scotland\u2014and it was locked. I shook it, and it seemed rather flimsy. For want of something better to do I put out my strength on that door, getting some purchase on the handle by looping my braces round it. Presently the thing gave with a crash which I thought would bring in my warders to inquire. I waited for a bit, and then started to explore the cupboard shelves.\n\nThere was a multitude of queer things there. I found an odd vesta or two in my trouser pockets and struck a light. It was out in a second, but it showed me one thing. There was a little stock of electric torches on one shelf. I picked up one, and found it was in working order.\n\nWith the torch to help me I investigated further. There were bottles and cases of queer-smelling stuffs, chemicals no doubt for experiments, and there were coils of fine copper wire and yanks and yanks of thin oiled silk. There was a box of detonators, and a lot of cord for fuses. Then away at the back of the shelf I found a stout brown cardboard box, and inside it a wooden case. I managed to wrench it open, and within lay half a dozen little grey bricks, each a couple of inches square.\n\nI took up one, and found that it crumbled easily in my hand. Then I smelt it and put my tongue to it. After that I sat down to think. I hadn\u2019t been a mining engineer for nothing, and I knew lentonite when I saw it.\n\nWith one of these bricks I could blow the house to smithereens. I had used the stuff in Rhodesia and knew its power. But the trouble was that my knowledge wasn\u2019t exact. I had forgotten the proper charge and the right way of preparing it, and I wasn\u2019t sure about the timing. I had only a vague notion, too, as to its power, for though I had used it I had not handled it with my own fingers.\n\nBut it was a chance, the only possible chance. It was a mighty risk, but against it was an absolute black certainty. If I used it the odds were, as I reckoned, about five to one in favour of my blowing myself into the tree-tops; but if I didn\u2019t I should very likely be occupying a six-foot hole in the garden by the evening. That was the way I had to look at it. The prospect was pretty dark either way, but anyhow there was a chance, both for myself and for my country.\n\nThe remembrance of little Scudder decided me. It was about the beastliest moment of my life, for I\u2019m no good at these cold-blooded resolutions. Still I managed to rake up the pluck to set my teeth and choke back the horrid doubts that flooded in on me. I simply shut off my mind and pretended I was doing an experiment as simple as Guy Fawkes fireworks.\n\nI got a detonator, and fixed it to a couple of feet of fuse. Then I took a quarter of a lentonite brick, and buried it near the door below one of the sacks in a crack of the floor, fixing the detonator in it. For all I knew half those boxes might be dynamite. If the cupboard held such deadly explosives, why not the boxes? In that case there would be a glorious skyward journey for me and the German servants and about an acre of surrounding country. There was also the risk that the detonation might set off the other bricks in the cupboard, for I had forgotten most that I knew about lentonite. But it didn\u2019t do to begin thinking about the possibilities. The odds were horrible, but I had to take them.\n\nI ensconced myself just below the sill of the window, and lit the fuse. Then I waited for a moment or two. There was dead silence\u2014only a shuffle of heavy boots in the passage, and the peaceful cluck of hens from the warm out-of-doors. I commended my soul to my Maker, and wondered where I would be in five seconds....\n\nA great wave of heat seemed to surge upwards from the floor, and hang for a blistering instant in the air. Then the wall opposite me flashed into a golden yellow and dissolved with a rending thunder that hammered my brain into a pulp. Something dropped on me, catching the point of my left shoulder.\n\nAnd then I think I became unconscious.",
    "I sat down on a hill-top and took stock of my position. I wasn\u2019t feeling very happy, for my natural thankfulness at my escape was clouded by my severe bodily discomfort. Those lentonite fumes had fairly poisoned me, and the baking hours on the dovecot hadn\u2019t helped matters. I had a crushing headache, and felt as sick as a cat. Also my shoulder was in a bad way. At first I thought it was only a bruise, but it seemed to be swelling, and I had no use of my left arm.\n\nMy plan was to seek Mr Turnbull\u2019s cottage, recover my garments, and especially Scudder\u2019s note-book, and then make for the main line and get back to the south. It seemed to me that the sooner I got in touch with the Foreign Office man, Sir Walter Bullivant, the better. I didn\u2019t see how I could get more proof than I had got already. He must just take or leave my story, and anyway, with him I would be in better hands than those devilish Germans. I had begun to feel quite kindly towards the British police.\n\nIt was a wonderful starry night, and I had not much difficulty about the road. Sir Harry\u2019s map had given me the lie of the land, and all I had to do was to steer a point or two west of south-west to come to the stream where I had met the roadman. In all these travels I never knew the names of the places, but I believe this stream was no less than the upper waters of the river Tweed. I calculated I must be about eighteen miles distant, and that meant I could not get there before morning. So I must lie up a day somewhere, for I was too outrageous a figure to be seen in the sunlight. I had neither coat, waistcoat, collar, nor hat, my trousers were badly torn, and my face and hands were black with the explosion. I daresay I had other beauties, for my eyes felt as if they were furiously bloodshot. Altogether I was no spectacle for God-fearing citizens to see on a highroad.\n\nVery soon after daybreak I made an attempt to clean myself in a hill burn, and then approached a herd\u2019s cottage, for I was feeling the need of food. The herd was away from home, and his wife was alone, with no neighbour for five miles. She was a decent old body, and a plucky one, for though she got a fright when she saw me, she had an axe handy, and would have used it on any evil-doer. I told her that I had had a fall\u2014I didn\u2019t say how\u2014and she saw by my looks that I was pretty sick. Like a true Samaritan she asked no questions, but gave me a bowl of milk with a dash of whisky in it, and let me sit for a little by her kitchen fire. She would have bathed my shoulder, but it ached so badly that I would not let her touch it.\n\nI don\u2019t know what she took me for\u2014a repentant burglar, perhaps; for when I wanted to pay her for the milk and tendered a sovereign which was the smallest coin I had, she shook her head and said something about \u201cgiving it to them that had a right to it\u201d. At this I protested so strongly that I think she believed me honest, for she took the money and gave me a warm new plaid for it, and an old hat of her man\u2019s. She showed me how to wrap the plaid around my shoulders, and when I left that cottage I was the living image of the kind of Scotsman you see in the illustrations to Burns\u2019s poems. But at any rate I was more or less clad.\n\nIt was as well, for the weather changed before midday to a thick drizzle of rain. I found shelter below an overhanging rock in the crook of a burn, where a drift of dead brackens made a tolerable bed. There I managed to sleep till nightfall, waking very cramped and wretched, with my shoulder gnawing like a toothache. I ate the oatcake and cheese the old wife had given me and set out again just before the darkening.\n\nI pass over the miseries of that night among the wet hills. There were no stars to steer by, and I had to do the best I could from my memory of the map. Twice I lost my way, and I had some nasty falls into peat-bogs. I had only about ten miles to go as the crow flies, but my mistakes made it nearer twenty. The last bit was completed with set teeth and a very light and dizzy head. But I managed it, and in the early dawn I was knocking at Mr Turnbull\u2019s door. The mist lay close and thick, and from the cottage I could not see the highroad.\n\nMr Turnbull himself opened to me\u2014sober and something more than sober. He was primly dressed in an ancient but well-tended suit of black; he had been shaved not later than the night before; he wore a linen collar; and in his left hand he carried a pocket Bible. At first he did not recognize me.\n\n\u201cWhae are ye that comes stravaigin\u2019 here on the Sabbath mornin\u2019?\u201d he asked.\n\nI had lost all count of the days. So the Sabbath was the reason for this strange decorum.\n\nMy head was swimming so wildly that I could not frame a coherent answer. But he recognized me, and he saw that I was ill.\n\n\u201cHae ye got my specs?\u201d he asked.\n\nI fetched them out of my trouser pocket and gave him them.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019ll hae come for your jaicket and westcoat,\u201d he said. \u201cCome in-bye. Losh, man, ye\u2019re terrible dune i\u2019 the legs. Haud up till I get ye to a chair.\u201d\n\nI perceived I was in for a bout of malaria. I had a good deal of fever in my bones, and the wet night had brought it out, while my shoulder and the effects of the fumes combined to make me feel pretty bad. Before I knew, Mr Turnbull was helping me off with my clothes, and putting me to bed in one of the two cupboards that lined the kitchen walls.",
    "When I entered that quiet thoroughfare it seemed deserted. Sir Walter\u2019s house was in the narrow part, and outside it three or four motor-cars were drawn up. I slackened speed some yards off and walked briskly up to the door. If the butler refused me admission, or if he even delayed to open the door, I was done.\n\nHe didn\u2019t delay. I had scarcely rung before the door opened.\n\n\u201cI must see Sir Walter,\u201d I panted. \u201cMy business is desperately important.\u201d\n\nThat butler was a great man. Without moving a muscle he held the door open, and then shut it behind me. \u201cSir Walter is engaged, sir, and I have orders to admit no one. Perhaps you will wait.\u201d\n\nThe house was of the old-fashioned kind, with a wide hall and rooms on both sides of it. At the far end was an alcove with a telephone and a couple of chairs, and there the butler offered me a seat.\n\n\u201cSee here,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThere\u2019s trouble about and I\u2019m in it. But Sir Walter knows, and I\u2019m working for him. If anyone comes and asks if I am here, tell him a lie.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, and presently there was a noise of voices in the street, and a furious ringing at the bell. I never admired a man more than that butler. He opened the door, and with a face like a graven image waited to be questioned. Then he gave them it. He told them whose house it was, and what his orders were, and simply froze them off the doorstep. I could see it all from my alcove, and it was better than any play.\n\nI hadn\u2019t waited long till there came another ring at the bell. The butler made no bones about admitting this new visitor.\n\nWhile he was taking off his coat I saw who it was. You couldn\u2019t open a newspaper or a magazine without seeing that face\u2014the grey beard cut like a spade, the firm fighting mouth, the blunt square nose, and the keen blue eyes. I recognized the First Sea Lord, the man, they say, that made the new British Navy.\n\nHe passed my alcove and was ushered into a room at the back of the hall. As the door opened I could hear the sound of low voices. It shut, and I was left alone again.\n\nFor twenty minutes I sat there, wondering what I was to do next. I was still perfectly convinced that I was wanted, but when or how I had no notion. I kept looking at my watch, and as the time crept on to half-past ten I began to think that the conference must soon end. In a quarter of an hour Royer should be speeding along the road to Portsmouth....\n\nThen I heard a bell ring, and the butler appeared. The door of the back room opened, and the First Sea Lord came out. He walked past me, and in passing he glanced in my direction, and for a second we looked each other in the face.\n\nOnly for a second, but it was enough to make my heart jump. I had never seen the great man before, and he had never seen me. But in that fraction of time something sprang into his eyes, and that something was recognition. You can\u2019t mistake it. It is a flicker, a spark of light, a minute shade of difference which means one thing and one thing only. It came involuntarily, for in a moment it died, and he passed on. In a maze of wild fancies I heard the street door close behind him.\n\nI picked up the telephone book and looked up the number of his house. We were connected at once, and I heard a servant\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cIs his Lordship at home?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHis Lordship returned half an hour ago,\u201d said the voice, \u201cand has gone to bed. He is not very well tonight. Will you leave a message, sir?\u201d\n\nI rang off and almost tumbled into a chair. My part in this business was not yet ended. It had been a close shave, but I had been in time.\n\nNot a moment could be lost, so I marched boldly to the door of that back room and entered without knocking.\n\nFive surprised faces looked up from a round table. There was Sir Walter, and Drew the War Minister, whom I knew from his photographs. There was a slim elderly man, who was probably Whittaker, the Admiralty official, and there was General Winstanley, conspicuous from the long scar on his forehead. Lastly, there was a short stout man with an iron-grey moustache and bushy eyebrows, who had been arrested in the middle of a sentence.\n\nSir Walter\u2019s face showed surprise and annoyance.\n\n\u201cThis is Mr Hannay, of whom I have spoken to you,\u201d he said apologetically to the company. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, Hannay, this visit is ill-timed.\u201d\n\nI was getting back my coolness. \u201cThat remains to be seen, sir,\u201d I said; \u201cbut I think it may be in the nick of time. For God\u2019s sake, gentlemen, tell me who went out a minute ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cLord Alloa,\u201d Sir Walter said, reddening with anger.\n\n\u201cIt was not,\u201d I cried; \u201cit was his living image, but it was not Lord Alloa. It was someone who recognized me, someone I have seen in the last month. He had scarcely left the doorstep when I rang up Lord Alloa\u2019s house and was told he had come in half an hour before and had gone to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2014who\u2014\u201d someone stammered.\n\n\u201cThe Black Stone,\u201d I cried, and I sat down in the chair so recently vacated and looked round at five badly scared gentlemen.",
    "\u201cBut I don\u2019t see,\u201d went on Winstanley. \u201cTheir object was to get these dispositions without our knowing it. Now it only required one of us to mention to Alloa our meeting tonight for the whole fraud to be exposed.\u201d\n\nSir Walter laughed dryly. \u201cThe selection of Alloa shows their acumen. Which of us was likely to speak to him about tonight? Or was he likely to open the subject?\u201d\n\nI remembered the First Sea Lord\u2019s reputation for taciturnity and shortness of temper.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that puzzles me,\u201d said the General, \u201cis what good his visit here would do that spy fellow? He could not carry away several pages of figures and strange names in his head.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not difficult,\u201d the Frenchman replied. \u201cA good spy is trained to have a photographic memory. Like your own Macaulay. You noticed he said nothing, but went through these papers again and again. I think we may assume that he has every detail stamped on his mind. When I was younger I could do the same trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose there is nothing for it but to change the plans,\u201d said Sir Walter ruefully.\n\nWhittaker was looking very glum. \u201cDid you tell Lord Alloa what has happened?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo? Well, I can\u2019t speak with absolute assurance, but I\u2019m nearly certain we can\u2019t make any serious change unless we alter the geography of England.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother thing must be said,\u201d it was Royer who spoke. \u201cI talked freely when that man was here. I told something of the military plans of my Government. I was permitted to say so much. But that information would be worth many millions to our enemies. No, my friends, I see no other way. The man who came here and his confederates must be taken, and taken at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood God,\u201d I cried, \u201cand we have not a rag of a clue.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d said Whittaker, \u201cthere is the post. By this time the news will be on its way.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the Frenchman. \u201cYou do not understand the habits of the spy. He receives personally his reward, and he delivers personally his intelligence. We in France know something of the breed. There is still a chance, _mes amis_. These men must cross the sea, and there are ships to be searched and ports to be watched. Believe me, the need is desperate for both France and Britain.\u201d\n\nRoyer\u2019s grave good sense seemed to pull us together. He was the man of action among fumblers. But I saw no hope in any face, and I felt none. Where among the fifty millions of these islands and within a dozen hours were we to lay hands on the three cleverest rogues in Europe?\n\nThen suddenly I had an inspiration.\n\n\u201cWhere is Scudder\u2019s book?\u201d I cried to Sir Walter. \u201cQuick, man, I remember something in it.\u201d\n\nHe unlocked the door of a bureau and gave it to me.\n\nI found the place. \u201c_Thirty-nine steps_,\u201d I read, and again, \u201c_Thirty-nine steps\u2014I counted them\u2014High tide_, 10.17 p.m.\u201d\n\nThe Admiralty man was looking at me as if he thought I had gone mad.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see it\u2019s a clue,\u201d I shouted. \u201cScudder knew where these fellows laired\u2014he knew where they were going to leave the country, though he kept the name to himself. Tomorrow was the day, and it was some place where high tide was at 10.17.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may have gone tonight,\u201d someone said.\n\n\u201cNot they. They have their own snug secret way, and they won\u2019t be hurried. I know Germans, and they are mad about working to a plan. Where the devil can I get a book of Tide Tables?\u201d\n\nWhittaker brightened up. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go over to the Admiralty.\u201d\n\nWe got into two of the waiting motor-cars\u2014all but Sir Walter, who went off to Scotland Yard\u2014to \u201cmobilize MacGillivray\u201d, so he said.\n\nWe marched through empty corridors and big bare chambers where the charwomen were busy, till we reached a little room lined with books and maps. A resident clerk was unearthed, who presently fetched from the library the Admiralty Tide Tables. I sat at the desk and the others stood round, for somehow or other I had got charge of this expedition.\n\nIt was no good. There were hundreds of entries, and so far as I could see 10.17 might cover fifty places. We had to find some way of narrowing the possibilities.\n\nI took my head in my hands and thought. There must be some way of reading this riddle. What did Scudder mean by steps? I thought of dock steps, but if he had meant that I didn\u2019t think he would have mentioned the number. It must be some place where there were several staircases, and one marked out from the others by having thirty-nine steps.\n\nThen I had a sudden thought, and hunted up all the steamer sailings. There was no boat which left for the Continent at 10.17 p.m.\n\nWhy was high tide so important? If it was a harbour it must be some little place where the tide mattered, or else it was a heavy-draught boat. But there was no regular steamer sailing at that hour, and somehow I didn\u2019t think they would travel by a big boat from a regular harbour. So it must be some little harbour where the tide was important, or perhaps no harbour at all.\n\nBut if it was a little port I couldn\u2019t see what the steps signified. There were no sets of staircases on any harbour that I had ever seen. It must be some place which a particular staircase identified, and where the tide was full at 10.17. On the whole it seemed to me that the place must be a bit of open coast. But the staircases kept puzzling me.\n\nThen I went back to wider considerations. Whereabouts would a man be likely to leave for Germany, a man in a hurry, who wanted a speedy and a secret passage? Not from any of the big harbours. And not from the Channel or the West Coast or Scotland, for, remember, he was starting from London. I measured the distance on the map, and tried to put myself in the enemy\u2019s shoes. I should try for Ostend or Antwerp or Rotterdam, and I should sail from somewhere on the East Coast between Cromer and Dover.",
    "A pink and blue June morning found me at Bradgate looking from the Griffin Hotel over a smooth sea to the lightship on the Cock sands which seemed the size of a bell-buoy. A couple of miles farther south and much nearer the shore a small destroyer was anchored. Scaife, MacGillivray\u2019s man, who had been in the Navy, knew the boat, and told me her name and her commander\u2019s, so I sent off a wire to Sir Walter.\n\nAfter breakfast Scaife got from a house-agent a key for the gates of the staircases on the Ruff. I walked with him along the sands, and sat down in a nook of the cliffs while he investigated the half-dozen of them. I didn\u2019t want to be seen, but the place at this hour was quite deserted, and all the time I was on that beach I saw nothing but the seagulls.\n\nIt took him more than an hour to do the job, and when I saw him coming towards me, conning a bit of paper, I can tell you my heart was in my mouth. Everything depended, you see, on my guess proving right.\n\nHe read aloud the number of steps in the different stairs. \u201cThirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-nine, forty-two, forty-seven,\u201d and \u201ctwenty-one\u201d where the cliffs grew lower. I almost got up and shouted.\n\nWe hurried back to the town and sent a wire to MacGillivray. I wanted half a dozen men, and I directed them to divide themselves among different specified hotels. Then Scaife set out to prospect the house at the head of the thirty-nine steps.\n\nHe came back with news that both puzzled and reassured me. The house was called Trafalgar Lodge, and belonged to an old gentleman called Appleton\u2014a retired stockbroker, the house-agent said. Mr. Appleton was there a good deal in the summer time, and was in residence now\u2014had been for the better part of a week. Scaife could pick up very little information about him, except that he was a decent old fellow, who paid his bills regularly, and was always good for a fiver for a local charity. Then Scaife seemed to have penetrated to the back door of the house, pretending he was an agent for sewing-machines. Only three servants were kept, a cook, a parlour-maid, and a housemaid, and they were just the sort that you would find in a respectable middle-class household. The cook was not the gossiping kind, and had pretty soon shut the door in his face, but Scaife said he was positive she knew nothing. Next door there was a new house building which would give good cover for observation, and the villa on the other side was to let, and its garden was rough and shrubby.\n\nI borrowed Scaife\u2019s telescope, and before lunch went for a walk along the Ruff. I kept well behind the rows of villas, and found a good observation point on the edge of the golf-course. There I had a view of the line of turf along the cliff top, with seats placed at intervals, and the little square plots, railed in and planted with bushes, whence the staircases descended to the beach. I saw Trafalgar Lodge very plainly, a red-brick villa with a veranda, a tennis lawn behind, and in front the ordinary seaside flower-garden full of marguerites and scraggy geraniums. There was a flagstaff from which an enormous Union Jack hung limply in the still air.\n\nPresently I observed someone leave the house and saunter along the cliff. When I got my glasses on him I saw it was an old man, wearing white flannel trousers, a blue serge jacket, and a straw hat. He carried field-glasses and a newspaper, and sat down on one of the iron seats and began to read. Sometimes he would lay down the paper and turn his glasses on the sea. He looked for a long time at the destroyer. I watched him for half an hour, till he got up and went back to the house for his luncheon, when I returned to the hotel for mine.\n\nI wasn\u2019t feeling very confident. This decent common-place dwelling was not what I had expected. The man might be the bald archaeologist of that horrible moorland farm, or he might not. He was exactly the kind of satisfied old bird you will find in every suburb and every holiday place. If you wanted a type of the perfectly harmless person you would probably pitch on that.\n\nBut after lunch, as I sat in the hotel porch, I perked up, for I saw the thing I had hoped for and had dreaded to miss. A yacht came up from the south and dropped anchor pretty well opposite the Ruff. She seemed about a hundred and fifty tons, and I saw she belonged to the Squadron from the white ensign. So Scaife and I went down to the harbour and hired a boatman for an afternoon\u2019s fishing.",
    "Feeling the greatest fool on earth, I opened the gate and rang the bell.\n\nA man of my sort, who has travelled about the world in rough places, gets on perfectly well with two classes, what you may call the upper and the lower. He understands them and they understand him. I was at home with herds and tramps and roadmen, and I was sufficiently at my ease with people like Sir Walter and the men I had met the night before. I can\u2019t explain why, but it is a fact. But what fellows like me don\u2019t understand is the great comfortable, satisfied middle-class world, the folk that live in villas and suburbs. He doesn\u2019t know how they look at things, he doesn\u2019t understand their conventions, and he is as shy of them as of a black mamba. When a trim parlour-maid opened the door, I could hardly find my voice.\n\nI asked for Mr. Appleton, and was ushered in. My plan had been to walk straight into the dining-room, and by a sudden appearance wake in the men that start of recognition which would confirm my theory. But when I found myself in that neat hall the place mastered me. There were the golf-clubs and tennis-rackets, the straw hats and caps, the rows of gloves, the sheaf of walking-sticks, which you will find in ten thousand British homes. A stack of neatly folded coats and waterproofs covered the top of an old oak chest; there was a grandfather clock ticking; and some polished brass warming-pans on the walls, and a barometer, and a print of Chiltern winning the St. Leger. The place was as orthodox as an Anglican church. When the maid asked me for my name I gave it automatically, and was shown into the smoking-room, on the right side of the hall.\n\nThat room was even worse. I hadn\u2019t time to examine it, but I could see some framed group photographs above the mantelpiece, and I could have sworn they were English public school or college. I had only one glance, for I managed to pull myself together and go after the maid. But I was too late. She had already entered the dining-room and given my name to her master, and I had missed the chance of seeing how the three took it.\n\nWhen I walked into the room the old man at the head of the table had risen and turned round to meet me. He was in evening dress\u2014a short coat and black tie, as was the other, whom I called in my own mind the plump one. The third, the dark fellow, wore a blue serge suit and a soft white collar, and the colours of some club or school.\n\nThe old man\u2019s manner was perfect. \u201cMr. Hannay?\u201d he said hesitatingly. \u201cDid you wish to see me? One moment, you fellows, and I\u2019ll rejoin you. We had better go to the smoking-room.\u201d\n\nThough I hadn\u2019t an ounce of confidence in me, I forced myself to play the game. I pulled up a chair and sat down on it.\n\n\u201cI think we have met before,\u201d I said, \u201cand I guess you know my business.\u201d\n\nThe light in the room was dim, but so far as I could see their faces, they played the part of mystification very well.\n\n\u201cMaybe, maybe,\u201d said the old man. \u201cI haven\u2019t a very good memory, but I\u2019m afraid you must tell me your errand, sir, for I really don\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d I said, and all the time I seemed to myself to be talking pure foolishness\u2014\u201cI have come to tell you that the game\u2019s up. I have a warrant for the arrest of you three gentlemen.\u201d\n\n\u201cArrest,\u201d said the old man, and he looked really shocked. \u201cArrest! Good God, what for?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the murder of Franklin Scudder in London on the 23rd day of last month.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never heard the name before,\u201d said the old man in a dazed voice.\n\nOne of the others spoke up. \u201cThat was the Portland Place murder. I read about it. Good heavens, you must be mad, sir! Where do you come from?\u201d\n\n\u201cScotland Yard,\u201d I said.\n\nAfter that for a minute there was utter silence. The old man was staring at his plate and fumbling with a nut, the very model of innocent bewilderment.\n\nThen the plump one spoke up. He stammered a little, like a man picking his words.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get flustered, uncle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all a ridiculous mistake; but these things happen sometimes, and we can easily set it right. It won\u2019t be hard to prove our innocence. I can show that I was out of the country on the 23rd of May, and Bob was in a nursing home. You were in London, but you can explain what you were doing.\u201d  \u201cRight, Percy! Of course that\u2019s easy enough. The 23rd! That was the day after Agatha\u2019s wedding. Let me see. What was I doing? I came up in the morning from Woking, and lunched at the club with Charlie Symons. Then\u2014oh yes, I dined with the Fishmongers. I remember, for the punch didn\u2019t agree with me, and I was seedy next morning. Hang it all, there\u2019s the cigar-box I brought back from the dinner.\u201d He pointed to an object on the table, and laughed nervously.\n\n\u201cI think, sir,\u201d said the young man, addressing me respectfully, \u201cyou will see you are mistaken. We want to assist the law like all Englishmen, and we don\u2019t want Scotland Yard to be making fools of themselves. That\u2019s so, uncle?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, Bob.\u201d The old fellow seemed to be recovering his voice. \u201cCertainly, we\u2019ll do anything in our power to assist the authorities. But\u2014but this is a bit too much. I can\u2019t get over it.\u201d  \u201cHow Nellie will chuckle,\u201d said the plump man. \u201cShe always said that you would die of boredom because nothing ever happened to you. And now you\u2019ve got it thick and strong,\u201d and he began to laugh very pleasantly.  \u201cBy Jove, yes. Just think of it! What a story to tell at the club. Really, Mr. Hannay, I suppose I should be angry, to show my innocence, but it\u2019s too funny! I almost forgive you the fright you gave me! You looked so glum, I thought I might have been walking in my sleep and killing people.\u201d\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be acting, it was too confoundedly genuine. My heart went into my boots, and my first impulse was to apologize and clear out. But I told myself I must see it through, even though I was to be the laughing-stock of Britain. The light from the dinner-table candlesticks was not very good, and to cover my confusion I got up, walked to the door and switched on the electric light. The sudden glare made them blink, and I stood scanning the three faces.  Well, I made nothing of it. One was old and bald, one was stout, one was dark and thin. There was nothing in their appearance to prevent them being the three who had hunted me in Scotland, but there was nothing to identify them. I simply can\u2019t explain why I who, as a roadman, had looked into two pairs of eyes, and as Ned Ainslie into another pair, why I, who have a good memory and reasonable powers of observation, could find no satisfaction. They seemed exactly what they professed to be, and I could not have sworn to one of them."

  "Jack London -- White Fang": [
    "The cub had broken through the wall of the world, the unknown had let go its hold of him, and here he was without hurt. But the first man on Mars would have experienced less unfamiliarity than did he. Without any antecedent knowledge, without any warning whatever that such existed, he found himself an explorer in a totally new world.\n\nNow that the terrible unknown had let go of him, he forgot that the unknown had any terrors. He was aware only of curiosity in all the things about him. He inspected the grass beneath him, the moss-berry plant just beyond, and the dead trunk of the blasted pine that stood on the edge of an open space among the trees. A squirrel, running around the base of the trunk, came full upon him, and gave him a great fright. He cowered down and snarled. But the squirrel was as badly scared. It ran up the tree, and from a point of safety chattered back savagely.\n\nThis helped the cub\u2019s courage, and though the woodpecker he next encountered gave him a start, he proceeded confidently on his way. Such was his confidence, that when a moose-bird impudently hopped up to him, he reached out at it with a playful paw. The result was a sharp peck on the end of his nose that made him cower down and ki-yi. The noise he made was too much for the moose-bird, who sought safety in flight.\n\nBut the cub was learning. His misty little mind had already made an unconscious classification. There were live things and things not alive. Also, he must watch out for the live things. The things not alive remained always in one place, but the live things moved about, and there was no telling what they might do. The thing to expect of them was the unexpected, and for this he must be prepared.\n\nHe travelled very clumsily. He ran into sticks and things. A twig that he thought a long way off, would the next instant hit him on the nose or rake along his ribs. There were inequalities of surface. Sometimes he overstepped and stubbed his nose. Quite as often he understepped and stubbed his feet. Then there were the pebbles and stones that turned under him when he trod upon them; and from them he came to know that the things not alive were not all in the same state of stable equilibrium as was his cave\u2014also, that small things not alive were more liable than large things to fall down or turn over. But with every mishap he was learning. The longer he walked, the better he walked. He was adjusting himself. He was learning to calculate his own muscular movements, to know his physical limitations, to measure distances between objects, and between objects and himself.\n\nHis was the luck of the beginner. Born to be a hunter of meat (though he did not know it), he blundered upon meat just outside his own cave-door on his first foray into the world. It was by sheer blundering that he chanced upon the shrewdly hidden ptarmigan nest. He fell into it. He had essayed to walk along the trunk of a fallen pine. The rotten bark gave way under his feet, and with a despairing yelp he pitched down the rounded crescent, smashed through the leafage and stalks of a small bush, and in the heart of the bush, on the ground, fetched up in the midst of seven ptarmigan chicks.\n\nThey made noises, and at first he was frightened at them. Then he perceived that they were very little, and he became bolder. They moved. He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated. This was a source of enjoyment to him. He smelled it. He picked it up in his mouth. It struggled and tickled his tongue. At the same time he was made aware of a sensation of hunger. His jaws closed together. There was a crunching of fragile bones, and warm blood ran in his mouth. The taste of it was good. This was meat, the same as his mother gave him, only it was alive between his teeth and therefore better. So he ate the ptarmigan. Nor did he stop till he had devoured the whole brood. Then he licked his chops in quite the same way his mother did, and began to crawl out of the bush.\n\nHe encountered a feathered whirlwind. He was confused and blinded by the rush of it and the beat of angry wings. He hid his head between his paws and yelped. The blows increased. The mother ptarmigan was in a fury. Then he became angry. He rose up, snarling, striking out with his paws. He sank his tiny teeth into one of the wings and pulled and tugged sturdily. The ptarmigan struggled against him, showering blows upon him with her free wing. It was his first battle. He was elated. He forgot all about the unknown. He no longer was afraid of anything. He was fighting, tearing at a live thing that was striking at him. Also, this live thing was meat. The lust to kill was on him. He had just destroyed little live things. He would now destroy a big live thing. He was too busy and happy to know that he was happy. He was thrilling and exulting in ways new to him and greater to him than any he had known before.\n\nHe held on to the wing and growled between his tight-clenched teeth. The ptarmigan dragged him out of the bush. When she turned and tried to drag him back into the bush\u2019s shelter, he pulled her away from it and on into the open. And all the time she was making outcry and striking with her free wing, while feathers were flying like a snow-fall. The pitch to which he was aroused was tremendous. All the fighting blood of his breed was up in him and surging through him. This was living, though he did not know it. He was realising his own meaning in the world; he was doing that for which he was made\u2014killing meat and battling to kill it. He was justifying his existence, than which life can do no greater; for life achieves its summit when it does to the uttermost that which it was equipped to do.\n\n\nAfter a time, the ptarmigan ceased her struggling. He still held her by the wing, and they lay on the ground and looked at each other. He tried to growl threateningly, ferociously. She pecked on his nose, which by now, what of previous adventures was sore. He winced but held on. She pecked him again and again. From wincing he went to whimpering. He tried to back away from her, oblivious to the fact that by his hold on her he dragged her after him. A rain of pecks fell on his ill-used nose. The flood of fight ebbed down in him, and, releasing his prey, he turned tail and scampered on across the open in inglorious retreat.\n\nHe lay down to rest on the other side of the open, near the edge of the bushes, his tongue lolling out, his chest heaving and panting, his nose still hurting him and causing him to continue his whimper. But as he lay there, suddenly there came to him a feeling as of something terrible impending. The unknown with all its terrors rushed upon him, and he shrank back instinctively into the shelter of the bush. As he did so, a draught of air fanned him, and a large, winged body swept ominously and silently past. A hawk, driving down out of the blue, had barely missed him.",
    "Impelled by the blows that rained upon him, now from this side, now from that, White Fang swung back and forth like an erratic and jerky pendulum. Varying were the emotions that surged through him. At first, he had known surprise. Then came a momentary fear, when he yelped several times to the impact of the hand. But this was quickly followed by anger. His free nature asserted itself, and he showed his teeth and snarled fearlessly in the face of the wrathful god. This but served to make the god more wrathful. The blows came faster, heavier, more shrewd to hurt.\n\nGrey Beaver continued to beat, White Fang continued to snarl. But this could not last for ever. One or the other must give over, and that one was White Fang. Fear surged through him again. For the first time he was being really man-handled. The occasional blows of sticks and stones he had previously experienced were as caresses compared with this. He broke down and began to cry and yelp. For a time each blow brought a yelp from him; but fear passed into terror, until finally his yelps were voiced in unbroken succession, unconnected with the rhythm of the punishment.\n\nAt last Grey Beaver withheld his hand. White Fang, hanging limply, continued to cry. This seemed to satisfy his master, who flung him down roughly in the bottom of the canoe. In the meantime the canoe had drifted down the stream. Grey Beaver picked up the paddle. White Fang was in his way. He spurned him savagely with his foot. In that moment White Fang\u2019s free nature flashed forth again, and he sank his teeth into the moccasined foot.\n\nThe beating that had gone before was as nothing compared with the beating he now received. Grey Beaver\u2019s wrath was terrible; likewise was White Fang\u2019s fright. Not only the hand, but the hard wooden paddle was used upon him; and he was bruised and sore in all his small body when he was again flung down in the canoe. Again, and this time with purpose, did Grey Beaver kick him. White Fang did not repeat his attack on the foot. He had learned another lesson of his bondage. Never, no matter what the circumstance, must he dare to bite the god who was lord and master over him; the body of the lord and master was sacred, not to be defiled by the teeth of such as he. That was evidently the crime of crimes, the one offence there was no condoning nor overlooking.\n\nWhen the canoe touched the shore, White Fang lay whimpering and motionless, waiting the will of Grey Beaver. It was Grey Beaver\u2019s will that he should go ashore, for ashore he was flung, striking heavily on his side and hurting his bruises afresh. He crawled tremblingly to his feet and stood whimpering. Lip-lip, who had watched the whole proceeding from the bank, now rushed upon him, knocking him over and sinking his teeth into him. White Fang was too helpless to defend himself, and it would have gone hard with him had not Grey Beaver\u2019s foot shot out, lifting Lip-lip into the air with its violence so that he smashed down to earth a dozen feet away. This was the man-animal\u2019s justice; and even then, in his own pitiable plight, White Fang experienced a little grateful thrill. At Grey Beaver\u2019s heels he limped obediently through the village to the tepee. And so it came that White Fang learned that the right to punish was something the gods reserved for themselves and denied to the lesser creatures under them.\n\nThat night, when all was still, White Fang remembered his mother and sorrowed for her. He sorrowed too loudly and woke up Grey Beaver, who beat him. After that he mourned gently when the gods were around. But sometimes, straying off to the edge of the woods by himself, he gave vent to his grief, and cried it out with loud whimperings and wailings.\n\nIt was during this period that he might have harkened to the memories of the lair and the stream and run back to the Wild. But the memory of his mother held him. As the hunting man-animals went out and came back, so she would come back to the village some time. So he remained in his bondage waiting for her.\n\nBut it was not altogether an unhappy bondage. There was much to interest him. Something was always happening. There was no end to the strange things these gods did, and he was always curious to see. Besides, he was learning how to get along with Grey Beaver. Obedience, rigid, undeviating obedience, was what was exacted of him; and in return he escaped beatings and his existence was tolerated.\n\nNay, Grey Beaver himself sometimes tossed him a piece of meat, and defended him against the other dogs in the eating of it. And such a piece of meat was of value. It was worth more, in some strange way, then a dozen pieces of meat from the hand of a squaw. Grey Beaver never petted nor caressed. Perhaps it was the weight of his hand, perhaps his justice, perhaps the sheer power of him, and perhaps it was all these things that influenced White Fang; for a certain tie of attachment was forming between him and his surly lord.\n\nInsidiously, and by remote ways, as well as by the power of stick and stone and clout of hand, were the shackles of White Fang\u2019s bondage being riveted upon him. The qualities in his kind that in the beginning made it possible for them to come in to the fires of men, were qualities capable of development. They were developing in him, and the camp-life, replete with misery as it was, was secretly endearing itself to him all the time. But White Fang was unaware of it. He knew only grief for the loss of Kiche, hope for her return, and a hungry yearning for the free life that had been his.",
    "White Fang took kindly to the work. He had travelled a greater distance than the other dogs in the yielding of himself to the rule of the gods, and he had learned more thoroughly the futility of opposing their will. In addition, the persecution he had suffered from the pack had made the pack less to him in the scheme of things, and man more. He had not learned to be dependent on his kind for companionship. Besides, Kiche was well-nigh forgotten; and the chief outlet of expression that remained to him was in the allegiance he tendered the gods he had accepted as masters. So he worked hard, learned discipline, and was obedient. Faithfulness and willingness characterised his toil. These are essential traits of the wolf and the wild-dog when they have become domesticated, and these traits White Fang possessed in unusual measure.\n\nA companionship did exist between White Fang and the other dogs, but it was one of warfare and enmity. He had never learned to play with them. He knew only how to fight, and fight with them he did, returning to them a hundred-fold the snaps and slashes they had given him in the days when Lip-lip was leader of the pack. But Lip-lip was no longer leader\u2014except when he fled away before his mates at the end of his rope, the sled bounding along behind. In camp he kept close to Mit-sah or Grey Beaver or Kloo-kooch. He did not dare venture away from the gods, for now the fangs of all dogs were against him, and he tasted to the dregs the persecution that had been White Fang\u2019s.\n\nWith the overthrow of Lip-lip, White Fang could have become leader of the pack. But he was too morose and solitary for that. He merely thrashed his team-mates. Otherwise he ignored them. They got out of his way when he came along; nor did the boldest of them ever dare to rob him of his meat. On the contrary, they devoured their own meat hurriedly, for fear that he would take it away from them. White Fang knew the law well: *to oppress the weak and obey the strong*. He ate his share of meat as rapidly as he could. And then woe the dog that had not yet finished! A snarl and a flash of fangs, and that dog would wail his indignation to the uncomforting stars while White Fang finished his portion for him.\n\nEvery little while, however, one dog or another would flame up in revolt and be promptly subdued. Thus White Fang was kept in training. He was jealous of the isolation in which he kept himself in the midst of the pack, and he fought often to maintain it. But such fights were of brief duration. He was too quick for the others. They were slashed open and bleeding before they knew what had happened, were whipped almost before they had begun to fight.\n\nAs rigid as the sled-discipline of the gods, was the discipline maintained by White Fang amongst his fellows. He never allowed them any latitude. He compelled them to an unremitting respect for him. They might do as they pleased amongst themselves. That was no concern of his. But it *was* his concern that they leave him alone in his isolation, get out of his way when he elected to walk among them, and at all times acknowledge his mastery over them. A hint of stiff-leggedness on their part, a lifted lip or a bristle of hair, and he would be upon them, merciless and cruel, swiftly convincing them of the error of their way.\n\nHe was a monstrous tyrant. His mastery was rigid as steel. He oppressed the weak with a vengeance. Not for nothing had he been exposed to the pitiless struggles for life in the day of his cubhood, when his mother and he, alone and unaided, held their own and survived in the ferocious environment of the Wild. And not for nothing had he learned to walk softly when superior strength went by. He oppressed the weak, but he respected the strong. And in the course of the long journey with Grey Beaver he walked softly indeed amongst the full-grown dogs in the camps of the strange man-animals they encountered.\n\nThe months passed by. Still continued the journey of Grey Beaver. White Fang\u2019s strength was developed by the long hours on trail and the steady toil at the sled; and it would have seemed that his mental development was well-nigh complete. He had come to know quite thoroughly the world in which he lived. His outlook was bleak and materialistic. The world as he saw it was a fierce and brutal world, a world without warmth, a world in which caresses and affection and the bright sweetnesses of the spirit did not exist.\n\nHe had no affection for Grey Beaver. True, he was a god, but a most savage god. White Fang was glad to acknowledge his lordship, but it was a lordship based upon superior intelligence and brute strength. There was something in the fibre of White Fang\u2019s being that made his lordship a thing to be desired, else he would not have come back from the Wild when he did to tender his allegiance. There were deeps in his nature which had never been sounded. A kind word, a caressing touch of the hand, on the part of Grey Beaver, might have sounded these deeps; but Grey Beaver did not caress, nor speak kind words. It was not his way. His primacy was savage, and savagely he ruled, administering justice with a club, punishing transgression with the pain of a blow, and rewarding merit, not by kindness, but by withholding a blow.\n\nSo White Fang knew nothing of the heaven a man\u2019s hand might contain for him. Besides, he did not like the hands of the man-animals. He was suspicious of them. It was true that they sometimes gave meat, but more often they gave hurt. Hands were things to keep away from. They hurled stones, wielded sticks and clubs and whips, administered slaps and clouts, and, when they touched him, were cunning to hurt with pinch and twist and wrench. In strange villages he had encountered the hands of the children and learned that they were cruel to hurt. Also, he had once nearly had an eye poked out by a toddling papoose. From these experiences he became suspicious of all children. He could not tolerate them. When they came near with their ominous hands, he got up.",
    "It was at the cutting-up of a moose, fresh-killed, that White Fang learned of the changed relations in which he stood to the dog-world. He had got for himself a hoof and part of the shin-bone, to which quite a bit of meat was attached. Withdrawn from the immediate scramble of the other dogs\u2014in fact out of sight behind a thicket\u2014he was devouring his prize, when Baseek rushed in upon him. Before he knew what he was doing, he had slashed the intruder twice and sprung clear. Baseek was surprised by the other\u2019s temerity and swiftness of attack. He stood, gazing stupidly across at White Fang, the raw, red shin-bone between them.\n\n\nBaseek was old, and already he had come to know the increasing valour of the dogs it had been his wont to bully. Bitter experiences these, which, perforce, he swallowed, calling upon all his wisdom to cope with them. In the old days he would have sprung upon White Fang in a fury of righteous wrath. But now his waning powers would not permit such a course. He bristled fiercely and looked ominously across the shin-bone at White Fang. And White Fang, resurrecting quite a deal of the old awe, seemed to wilt and to shrink in upon himself and grow small, as he cast about in his mind for a way to beat a retreat not too inglorious.\n\n\nAnd right here Baseek erred. Had he contented himself with looking fierce and ominous, all would have been well. White Fang, on the verge of retreat, would have retreated, leaving the meat to him. But Baseek did not wait. He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat. As he bent his head carelessly to smell it, White Fang bristled slightly. Even then it was not too late for Baseek to retrieve the situation. Had he merely stood over the meat, head up and glowering, White Fang would ultimately have slunk away. But the fresh meat was strong in Baseek\u2019s nostrils, and greed urged him to take a bite of it.\n\n\nThis was too much for White Fang. Fresh upon his months of mastery over his own team-mates, it was beyond his self-control to stand idly by while another devoured the meat that belonged to him. He struck, after his custom, without warning. With the first slash, Baseek\u2019s right ear was ripped into ribbons. He was astounded at the suddenness of it. But more things, and most grievous ones, were happening with equal suddenness. He was knocked off his feet. His throat was bitten. While he was struggling to his feet the young dog sank teeth twice into his shoulder. The swiftness of it was bewildering. He made a futile rush at White Fang, clipping the empty air with an outraged snap. The next moment his nose was laid open, and he was staggering backward away from the meat.\n\n\nThe situation was now reversed. White Fang stood over the shin-bone, bristling and menacing, while Baseek stood a little way off, preparing to retreat. He dared not risk a fight with this young lightning-flash, and again he knew, and more bitterly, the enfeeblement of oncoming age. His attempt to maintain his dignity was heroic. Calmly turning his back upon young dog and shin-bone, as though both were beneath his notice and unworthy of his consideration, he stalked grandly away. Nor, until well out of sight, did he stop to lick his bleeding wounds.\n\n\nThe effect on White Fang was to give him a greater faith in himself, and a greater pride. He walked less softly among the grown dogs; his attitude toward them was less compromising. Not that he went out of his way looking for trouble. Far from it. But upon his way he demanded consideration. He stood upon his right to go his way unmolested and to give trail to no dog. He had to be taken into account, that was all. He was no longer to be disregarded and ignored, as was the lot of puppies, and as continued to be the lot of the puppies that were his team-mates. They got out of the way, gave trail to the grown dogs, and gave up meat to them under compulsion. But White Fang, uncompanionable, solitary, morose, scarcely looking to right or left, redoubtable, forbidding of aspect, remote and alien, was accepted as an equal by his puzzled elders. They quickly learned to leave him alone, neither venturing hostile acts nor making overtures of friendliness. If they left him alone, he left them alone\u2014a state of affairs that they found, after a few encounters, to be pre-eminently desirable.\n\n\nIn midsummer White Fang had an experience. Trotting along in his silent way to investigate a new tepee which had been erected on the edge of the village while he was away with the hunters after moose, he came full upon Kiche. He paused and looked at her. He remembered her vaguely, but he _remembered_ her, and that was more than could be said for her. She lifted her lip at him in the old snarl of menace, and his memory became clear. His forgotten cubhood, all that was associated with that familiar snarl, rushed back to him. Before he had known the gods, she had been to him the centre-pin of the universe. The old familiar feelings of that time came back upon him, surged up within him. He bounded towards her joyously, and she met him with shrewd fangs that laid his cheek open to the bone. He did not understand. He backed away, bewildered and puzzled.\n\n\nBut it was not Kiche\u2019s fault. A wolf-mother was not made to remember her cubs of a year or so before. So she did not remember White Fang. He was a strange animal, an intruder; and her present litter of puppies gave her the right to resent such intrusion.\n\n\nOne of the puppies sprawled up to White Fang. They were half-brothers, only they did not know it. White Fang sniffed the puppy curiously, whereupon Kiche rushed upon him, gashing his face a second time. He backed farther away. All the old memories and associations died down again and passed into the grave from which they had been resurrected. He looked at Kiche licking her puppy and stopping now and then to snarl at him. She was without value to him. He had learned to get along without her. Her meaning was forgotten. There was no place for her in his scheme of things, as there was no place for him in hers.\n\n\nHe was still standing, stupid and bewildered, the memories forgotten, wondering what it was all about, when Kiche attacked him a third time, intent on driving him away altogether from the vicinity. And White Fang allowed himself to be driven away. This was a female of his kind, and it was a law of his kind that the males must not fight the females. He did not know anything about this law, for it was no generalisation of the mind, not a something acquired by experience of the world. He knew it as a secret prompting, as an urge of instinct\u2014of the same instinct that made him howl at the moon and stars of nights, and that made him fear death and the unknown.",
    "Under the tutelage of the mad god, White Fang became a fiend. He was kept chained in a pen at the rear of the fort, and here Beauty Smith teased and irritated and drove him wild with petty torments. The man early discovered White Fang\u2019s susceptibility to laughter, and made it a point after painfully tricking him, to laugh at him. This laughter was uproarious and scornful, and at the same time the god pointed his finger derisively at White Fang. At such times reason fled from White Fang, and in his transports of rage he was even more mad than Beauty Smith.\n\n\nFormerly, White Fang had been merely the enemy of his kind, withal a ferocious enemy. He now became the enemy of all things, and more ferocious than ever. To such an extent was he tormented, that he hated blindly and without the faintest spark of reason. He hated the chain that bound him, the men who peered in at him through the slats of the pen, the dogs that accompanied the men and that snarled malignantly at him in his helplessness. He hated the very wood of the pen that confined him. And, first, last, and most of all, he hated Beauty Smith.\n\n\nBut Beauty Smith had a purpose in all that he did to White Fang. One day a number of men gathered about the pen. Beauty Smith entered, club in hand, and took the chain off from White Fang\u2019s neck. When his master had gone out, White Fang turned loose and tore around the pen, trying to get at the men outside. He was magnificently terrible. Fully five feet in length, and standing two and one-half feet at the shoulder, he far outweighed a wolf of corresponding size. From his mother he had inherited the heavier proportions of the dog, so that he weighed, without any fat and without an ounce of superfluous flesh, over ninety pounds. It was all muscle, bone, and sinew-fighting flesh in the finest condition.\n\n\nThe door of the pen was being opened again. White Fang paused. Something unusual was happening. He waited. The door was opened wider. Then a huge dog was thrust inside, and the door was slammed shut behind him. White Fang had never seen such a dog (it was a mastiff); but the size and fierce aspect of the intruder did not deter him. Here was something, not wood nor iron, upon which to wreak his hate. He leaped in with a flash of fangs that ripped down the side of the mastiff\u2019s neck. The mastiff shook his head, growled hoarsely, and plunged at White Fang. But White Fang was here, there, and everywhere, always evading and eluding, and always leaping in and slashing with his fangs and leaping out again in time to escape punishment.\n\n\nThe men outside shouted and applauded, while Beauty Smith, in an ecstasy of delight, gloated over the ripping and mangling performed by White Fang. There was no hope for the mastiff from the first. He was too ponderous and slow. In the end, while Beauty Smith beat White Fang back with a club, the mastiff was dragged out by its owner. Then there was a payment of bets, and money clinked in Beauty Smith\u2019s hand.\n\n\nWhite Fang came to look forward eagerly to the gathering of the men around his pen. It meant a fight; and this was the only way that was now vouchsafed him of expressing the life that was in him. Tormented, incited to hate, he was kept a prisoner so that there was no way of satisfying that hate except at the times his master saw fit to put another dog against him. Beauty Smith had estimated his powers well, for he was invariably the victor. One day, three dogs were turned in upon him in succession. Another day a full-grown wolf, fresh-caught from the Wild, was shoved in through the door of the pen. And on still another day two dogs were set against him at the same time. This was his severest fight, and though in the end he killed them both he was himself half killed in doing it.\n\n\nIn the fall of the year, when the first snows were falling and mush-ice was running in the river, Beauty Smith took passage for himself and White Fang on a steamboat bound up the Yukon to Dawson. White Fang had now achieved a reputation in the land. As \u201cthe Fighting Wolf\u201d he was known far and wide, and the cage in which he was kept on the steamboat\u2019s deck was usually surrounded by curious men. He raged and snarled at them, or lay quietly and studied them with cold hatred. Why should he not hate them? He never asked himself the question. He knew only hate and lost himself in the passion of it. Life had become a hell to him. He had not been made for the close confinement wild beasts endure at the hands of men. And yet it was in precisely this way that he was treated. Men stared at him, poked sticks between the bars to make him snarl, and then laughed at him.\n\n\nThey were his environment, these men, and they were moulding the clay of him into a more ferocious thing than had been intended by Nature. Nevertheless, Nature had given him plasticity. Where many another animal would have died or had its spirit broken, he adjusted himself and lived, and at no expense of the spirit. Possibly Beauty Smith, arch-fiend and tormentor, was capable of breaking White Fang\u2019s spirit, but as yet there were no signs of his succeeding.\n\n\nIf Beauty Smith had in him a devil, White Fang had another; and the two of them raged against each other unceasingly. In the days before, White Fang had had the wisdom to cower down and submit to a man with a club in his hand; but this wisdom now left him. The mere sight of Beauty Smith was sufficient to send him into transports of fury. And when they came to close quarters, and he had been beaten back by the club, he went on growling and snarling, and showing his fangs. The last growl could never be extracted from him. No matter how terribly he was beaten, he had always another growl; and when Beauty Smith gave up and withdrew, the defiant growl followed after him, or White Fang sprang at the bars of the cage bellowing his hatred.\n\n\nWhen the steamboat arrived at Dawson, White Fang went ashore. But he still lived a public life, in a cage, surrounded by curious men. He was exhibited as \u201cthe Fighting Wolf,\u201d and men paid fifty cents in gold dust to see him. He was given no rest. Did he lie down to sleep, he was stirred up by a sharp stick\u2014so that the audience might get its money\u2019s worth. In order to make the exhibition interesting, he was kept in a rage most of the time. But worse than all this, was the atmosphere in which he lived. He was regarded as the most fearful of wild beasts, and this was borne in to him through the bars of the cage. Every word, every cautious action, on the part of the men, impressed upon him his own terrible ferocity. It was so much added fuel to the flame of his fierceness. There could be but one result, and that was that his ferocity fed upon itself and increased. It was another instance of the plasticity of his clay, of his capacity for being moulded by the pressure of environment.",
    "Beauty Smith slipped the chain from his neck and stepped back.\n\n\nFor once White Fang did not make an immediate attack. He stood still, ears pricked forward, alert and curious, surveying the strange animal that faced him. He had never seen such a dog before. Tim Keenan shoved the bull-dog forward with a muttered \u201cGo to it.\u201d The animal waddled toward the centre of the circle, short and squat and ungainly. He came to a stop and blinked across at White Fang.\n\n\nThere were cries from the crowd of, \u201cGo to him, Cherokee! Sick \u2019m, Cherokee! Eat \u2019m up!\u201d\n\n\nBut Cherokee did not seem anxious to fight. He turned his head and blinked at the men who shouted, at the same time wagging his stump of a tail good-naturedly. He was not afraid, but merely lazy. Besides, it did not seem to him that it was intended he should fight with the dog he saw before him. He was not used to fighting with that kind of dog, and he was waiting for them to bring on the real dog.\n\n\nTim Keenan stepped in and bent over Cherokee, fondling him on both sides of the shoulders with hands that rubbed against the grain of the hair and that made slight, pushing-forward movements. These were so many suggestions. Also, their effect was irritating, for Cherokee began to growl, very softly, deep down in his throat. There was a correspondence in rhythm between the growls and the movements of the man\u2019s hands. The growl rose in the throat with the culmination of each forward-pushing movement, and ebbed down to start up afresh with the beginning of the next movement. The end of each movement was the accent of the rhythm, the movement ending abruptly and the growling rising with a jerk.\n\n\nThis was not without its effect on White Fang. The hair began to rise on his neck and across the shoulders. Tim Keenan gave a final shove forward and stepped back again. As the impetus that carried Cherokee forward died down, he continued to go forward of his own volition, in a swift, bow-legged run. Then White Fang struck. A cry of startled admiration went up. He had covered the distance and gone in more like a cat than a dog; and with the same cat-like swiftness he had slashed with his fangs and leaped clear.\n\n\nThe bull-dog was bleeding back of one ear from a rip in his thick neck. He gave no sign, did not even snarl, but turned and followed after White Fang. The display on both sides, the quickness of the one and the steadiness of the other, had excited the partisan spirit of the crowd, and the men were making new bets and increasing original bets. Again, and yet again, White Fang sprang in, slashed, and got away untouched, and still his strange foe followed after him, without too great haste, not slowly, but deliberately and determinedly, in a businesslike sort of way. There was purpose in his method\u2014something for him to do that he was intent upon doing and from which nothing could distract him.\n\n\nHis whole demeanour, every action, was stamped with this purpose. It puzzled White Fang. Never had he seen such a dog. It had no hair protection. It was soft, and bled easily. There was no thick mat of fur to baffle White Fang\u2019s teeth as they were often baffled by dogs of his own breed. Each time that his teeth struck they sank easily into the yielding flesh, while the animal did not seem able to defend itself. Another disconcerting thing was that it made no outcry, such as he had been accustomed to with the other dogs he had fought. Beyond a growl or a grunt, the dog took its punishment silently. And never did it flag in its pursuit of him.\n\n\nNot that Cherokee was slow. He could turn and whirl swiftly enough, but White Fang was never there. Cherokee was puzzled, too. He had never fought before with a dog with which he could not close. The desire to close had always been mutual. But here was a dog that kept at a distance, dancing and dodging here and there and all about. And when it did get its teeth into him, it did not hold on but let go instantly and darted away again.\n\n\nBut White Fang could not get at the soft underside of the throat. The bull-dog stood too short, while its massive jaws were an added protection. White Fang darted in and out unscathed, while Cherokee\u2019s wounds increased. Both sides of his neck and head were ripped and slashed. He bled freely, but showed no signs of being disconcerted. He continued his plodding pursuit, though once, for the moment baffled, he came to a full stop and blinked at the men who looked on, at the same time wagging his stump of a tail as an expression of his willingness to fight.\n\n\nIn that moment White Fang was in upon him and out, in passing ripping his trimmed remnant of an ear. With a slight manifestation of anger, Cherokee took up the pursuit again, running on the inside of the circle White Fang was making, and striving to fasten his deadly grip on White Fang\u2019s throat. The bull-dog missed by a hair\u2019s-breadth, and cries of praise went up as White Fang doubled suddenly out of danger in the opposite direction.\n\n\nThe time went by. White Fang still danced on, dodging and doubling, leaping in and out, and ever inflicting damage. And still the bull-dog, with grim certitude, toiled after him. Sooner or later he would accomplish his purpose, get the grip that would win the battle. In the meantime, he accepted all the punishment the other could deal him. His tufts of ears had become tassels, his neck and shoulders were slashed in a score of places, and his very lips were cut and bleeding\u2014all from these lightning snaps that were beyond his foreseeing and guarding.\n\n\nTime and again White Fang had attempted to knock Cherokee off his feet; but the difference in their height was too great. Cherokee was too squat, too close to the ground. White Fang tried the trick once too often. The chance came in one of his quick doublings and counter-circlings. He caught Cherokee with head turned away as he whirled more slowly. His shoulder was exposed. White Fang drove in upon it: but his own shoulder was high above, while he struck with such force that his momentum carried him on across over the other\u2019s body. For the first time in his fighting history, men saw White Fang lose his footing. His body turned a half-somersault in the air, and he would have landed on his back had he not twisted, catlike, still in the air, in the effort to bring his feet to the earth. As it was, he struck heavily on his side. The next instant he was on his feet, but in that instant Cherokee\u2019s teeth closed on his throat.",
    "There was a carriage waiting. A man and a woman approached the master. The woman\u2019s arms went out and clutched the master around the neck\u2014a hostile act! The next moment Weedon Scott had torn loose from the embrace and closed with White Fang, who had become a snarling, raging demon. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, mother,\u201d Scott was saying as he kept tight hold of White Fang and placated him. \u201cHe thought you were going to injure me, and he wouldn\u2019t stand for it. It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right. He\u2019ll learn soon enough.\u201d \u201cAnd in the meantime I may be permitted to love my son when his dog is not around,\u201d she laughed, though she was pale and weak from the fright. She looked at White Fang, who snarled and bristled and glared malevolently. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to learn, and he shall, without postponement,\u201d Scott said. He spoke softly to White Fang until he had quieted him, then his voice became firm. \u201cDown, sir! Down with you!\u201d This had been one of the things taught him by the master, and White Fang obeyed, though he lay down reluctantly and sullenly. \u201cNow, mother.\u201d Scott opened his arms to her, but kept his eyes on White Fang. \u201cDown!\u201d he warned. \u201cDown!\u201d White Fang, bristling silently, half-crouching as he rose, sank back and watched the hostile act repeated. But no harm came of it, nor of the embrace from the strange man-god that followed. Then the clothes-bags were taken into the carriage, the strange gods and the love-master followed, and White Fang pursued, now running vigilantly behind, now bristling up to the running horses and warning them that he was there to see that no harm befell the god they dragged so swiftly across the earth.\n\nAt the end of fifteen minutes, the carriage swung in through a stone gateway and on between a double row of arched and interlacing walnut trees. On either side stretched lawns, their broad sweep broken here and there by great sturdy-limbed oaks. In the near distance, in contrast with the young-green of the tended grass, sunburnt hay-fields showed tan and gold; while beyond were the tawny hills and upland pastures. From the head of the lawn, on the first soft swell from the valley-level, looked down the deep-porched, many-windowed house. Little opportunity was given White Fang to see all this. Hardly had the carriage entered the grounds, when he was set upon by a sheep-dog, bright-eyed, sharp-muzzled, righteously indignant and angry. It was between him and the master, cutting him off. White Fang snarled no warning, but his hair bristled as he made his silent and deadly rush. This rush was never completed. He halted with awkward abruptness, with stiff fore-legs bracing himself against his momentum, almost sitting down on his haunches, so desirous was he of avoiding contact with the dog he was in the act of attacking. It was a female, and the law of his kind thrust a barrier between. For him to attack her would require nothing less than a violation of his instinct.\n\nBut with the sheep-dog it was otherwise. Being a female, she possessed no such instinct. On the other hand, being a sheep-dog, her instinctive fear of the Wild, and especially of the wolf, was unusually keen. White Fang was to her a wolf, the hereditary marauder who had preyed upon her flocks from the time sheep were first herded and guarded by some dim ancestor of hers. And so, as he abandoned his rush at her and braced himself to avoid the contact, she sprang upon him. He snarled involuntarily as he felt her teeth in his shoulder, but beyond this made no offer to hurt her. He backed away, stiff-legged with self-consciousness, and tried to go around her. He dodged this way and that, and curved and turned, but to no purpose. She remained always between him and the way he wanted to go.\n\n\u201cHere, Collie!\u201d called the strange man in the carriage. Weedon Scott laughed. \u201cNever mind, father. It is good discipline. White Fang will have to learn many things, and it\u2019s just as well that he begins now. He\u2019ll adjust himself all right.\u201d The carriage drove on, and still Collie blocked White Fang\u2019s way. He tried to outrun her by leaving the drive and circling across the lawn; but she ran on the inner and smaller circle, and was always there, facing him with her two rows of gleaming teeth. Back he circled, across the drive to the other lawn, and again she headed him off.\n\nThe carriage was bearing the master away. White Fang caught glimpses of it disappearing amongst the trees. The situation was desperate. He essayed another circle. She followed, running swiftly. And then, suddenly, he turned upon her. It was his old fighting trick. Shoulder to shoulder, he struck her squarely. Not only was she overthrown. So fast had she been running that she rolled along, now on her back, now on her side, as she struggled to stop, clawing gravel with her feet and crying shrilly her hurt pride and indignation. White Fang did not wait. The way was clear, and that was all he had wanted. She took after him, never ceasing her outcry. It was the straightaway now, and when it came to real running, White Fang could teach her things. She ran frantically, hysterically, straining to the utmost, advertising the effort she was making with every leap: and all the time White Fang slid smoothly away from her silently, without effort, gliding like a ghost over the ground.\n\nAs he rounded the house to the _porte-coch\u00e8re_, he came upon the carriage. It had stopped, and the master was alighting. At this moment, still running at top speed, White Fang became suddenly aware of an attack from the side. It was a deer-hound rushing upon him. White Fang tried to face it. But he was going too fast, and the hound was too close. It struck him on the side; and such was his forward momentum and the unexpectedness of it, White Fang was hurled to the ground and rolled clear over. He came out of the tangle a spectacle of malignancy, ears flattened back, lips writhing, nose wrinkling, his teeth clipping together as the fangs barely missed the hound\u2019s soft throat. The master was running up, but was too far away; and it was Collie that saved the hound\u2019s life. Before White Fang could spring in and deliver the fatal stroke, and just as he was in the act of springing in, Collie arrived. She had been out-manoeuvred and out-run, to say nothing of her having been unceremoniously tumbled in the gravel, and her arrival was like that of a tornado\u2014made up of offended dignity, justifiable wrath, and instinctive hatred for this marauder from the Wild. She struck White Fang at right angles in the midst of his spring, and again he was knocked off his feet and rolled over.",
    "Thus it was with the two children. All his life he had disliked children. He hated and feared their hands. The lessons were not tender that he had learned of their tyranny and cruelty in the days of the Indian villages. When Weedon and Maud had first approached him, he growled warningly and looked malignant. A cuff from the master and a sharp word had then compelled him to permit their caresses, though he growled and growled under their tiny hands, and in the growl there was no crooning note. Later, he observed that the boy and girl were of great value in the master\u2019s eyes. Then it was that no cuff nor sharp word was necessary before they could pat him.\n\nYet White Fang was never effusively affectionate. He yielded to the master\u2019s children with an ill but honest grace, and endured their fooling as one would endure a painful operation. When he could no longer endure, he would get up and stalk determinedly away from them. But after a time, he grew even to like the children. Still he was not demonstrative. He would not go up to them. On the other hand, instead of walking away at sight of them, he waited for them to come to him. And still later, it was noticed that a pleased light came into his eyes when he saw them approaching, and that he looked after them with an appearance of curious regret when they left him for other amusements.\n\nAll this was a matter of development, and took time. Next in his regard, after the children, was Judge Scott. There were two reasons, possibly, for this. First, he was evidently a valuable possession of the master\u2019s, and next, he was undemonstrative. White Fang liked to lie at his feet on the wide porch when he read the newspaper, from time to time favouring White Fang with a look or a word\u2014untroublesome tokens that he recognised White Fang\u2019s presence and existence. But this was only when the master was not around. When the master appeared, all other beings ceased to exist so far as White Fang was concerned.\n\nWhite Fang allowed all the members of the family to pet him and make much of him; but he never gave to them what he gave to the master. No caress of theirs could put the love-croon into his throat, and, try as they would, they could never persuade him into snuggling against them. This expression of abandon and surrender, of absolute trust, he reserved for the master alone. In fact, he never regarded the members of the family in any other light than possessions of the love-master.\n\nAlso White Fang had early come to differentiate between the family and the servants of the household. The latter were afraid of him, while he merely refrained from attacking them. This because he considered that they were likewise possessions of the master. Between White Fang and them existed a neutrality and no more. They cooked for the master and washed the dishes and did other things just as Matt had done up in the Klondike. They were, in short, appurtenances of the household.\n\nOutside the household there was even more for White Fang to learn. The master\u2019s domain was wide and complex, yet it had its metes and bounds. The land itself ceased at the county road. Outside was the common domain of all gods\u2014the roads and streets. Then inside other fences were the particular domains of other gods. A myriad laws governed all these things and determined conduct; yet he did not know the speech of the gods, nor was there any way for him to learn save by experience. He obeyed his natural impulses until they ran him counter to some law. When this had been done a few times, he learned the law and after that observed it.\n\nBut most potent in his education was the cuff of the master\u2019s hand, the censure of the master\u2019s voice. Because of White Fang\u2019s very great love, a cuff from the master hurt him far more than any beating Grey Beaver or Beauty Smith had ever given him. They had hurt only the flesh of him; beneath the flesh the spirit had still raged, splendid and invincible. But with the master the cuff was always too light to hurt the flesh. Yet it went deeper. It was an expression of the master\u2019s disapproval, and White Fang\u2019s spirit wilted under it.\n\nIn point of fact, the cuff was rarely administered. The master\u2019s voice was sufficient. By it White Fang knew whether he did right or not. By it he trimmed his conduct and adjusted his actions. It was the compass by which he steered and learned to chart the manners of a new land and life.",
    "The months came and went. There was plenty of food and no work in the Southland, and White Fang lived fat and prosperous and happy. Not alone was he in the geographical Southland, for he was in the Southland of life. Human kindness was like a sun shining upon him, and he flourished like a flower planted in good soil.\n\nAnd yet he remained somehow different from other dogs. He knew the law even better than did the dogs that had known no other life, and he observed the law more punctiliously; but still there was about him a suggestion of lurking ferocity, as though the Wild still lingered in him and the wolf in him merely slept.\n\nHe never chummed with other dogs. Lonely he had lived, so far as his kind was concerned, and lonely he would continue to live. In his puppyhood, under the persecution of Lip-lip and the puppy-pack, and in his fighting days with Beauty Smith, he had acquired a fixed aversion for dogs. The natural course of his life had been diverted, and, recoiling from his kind, he had clung to the human.\n\nBesides, all Southland dogs looked upon him with suspicion. He aroused in them their instinctive fear of the Wild, and they greeted him always with snarl and growl and belligerent hatred. He, on the other hand, learned that it was not necessary to use his teeth upon them. His naked fangs and writhing lips were uniformly efficacious, rarely failing to send a bellowing on-rushing dog back on its haunches.\n\nBut there was one trial in White Fang\u2019s life\u2014Collie. She never gave him a moment\u2019s peace. She was not so amenable to the law as he. She defied all efforts of the master to make her become friends with White Fang. Ever in his ears was sounding her sharp and nervous snarl. She had never forgiven him the chicken-killing episode, and persistently held to the belief that his intentions were bad. She found him guilty before the act, and treated him accordingly. She became a pest to him, like a policeman following him around the stable and the hounds, and, if he even so much as glanced curiously at a pigeon or chicken, bursting into an outcry of indignation and wrath. His favourite way of ignoring her was to lie down, with his head on his fore-paws, and pretend sleep. This always dumfounded and silenced her.\n\nWith the exception of Collie, all things went well with White Fang. He had learned control and poise, and he knew the law. He achieved a staidness, and calmness, and philosophic tolerance. He no longer lived in a hostile environment. Danger and hurt and death did not lurk everywhere about him. In time, the unknown, as a thing of terror and menace ever impending, faded away. Life was soft and easy. It flowed along smoothly, and neither fear nor foe lurked by the way.\n\nHe missed the snow without being aware of it. \u201cAn unduly long summer,\u201d would have been his thought had he thought about it; as it was, he merely missed the snow in a vague, subconscious way. In the same fashion, especially in the heat of summer when he suffered from the sun, he experienced faint longings for the Northland. Their only effect upon him, however, was to make him uneasy and restless without his knowing what was the matter."

  "Jules Verne -- Around the World in Eighty Days": [
    "Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814. He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little was known, except that he was a polished man of the world. People said that he resembled Byron\u2014at least that his head was Byronic; but he was a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without growing old.\n\nCertainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner. He was never seen on \u2019Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the counting-rooms of the \u201cCity\u201d; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln\u2019s Inn, or Gray\u2019s Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen\u2019s Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts. He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution, the Artisan\u2019s Association, or the Institution of Arts and Sciences. He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects.\n\nPhileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all.\n\nThe way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough. He was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit. His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current, which was always flush.\n\nWas Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information. He was not lavish, nor, on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously. He was, in short, the least communicative of men. He talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner. His daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled.\n\nHad he travelled? It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He often corrected, with a few clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true probabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so often did events justify his predictions. He must have travelled everywhere, at least in the spirit.\n\nIt was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years. Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist. He often won at this game, which, as a silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities. Mr. Fogg played, not to win, but for the sake of playing. The game was in his eyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes.\n\nPhileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may happen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends, which is certainly more unusual. He lived alone in his house in Saville Row, whither none penetrated. A single domestic sufficed to serve him. He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table, never taking his meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly midnight, only to retire at once to bed. He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members. He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or making his toilet. When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted windows. When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club\u2014its kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy\u2014aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters, in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered the viands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club decanters, of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.\n\nIf to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity.\n\nThe mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly comfortable. The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular. On this very 2nd of October he had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house between eleven and half-past.\n\nPhileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his knees, his body straight, his head erect; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the days, the months, and the years. At exactly half-past eleven Mr. Fogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair to the Reform.\n\nA rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant, appeared.\n\n\u201cThe new servant,\u201d said he.\n\nA young man of thirty advanced and bowed.\n\n\u201cYou are a Frenchman, I believe,\u201d asked Phileas Fogg, \u201cand your name is John?\u201d\n\n\u201cJean, if monsieur pleases,\u201d replied the newcomer, \u201cJean Passepartout, a surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for going out of one business into another. I believe I\u2019m honest, monsieur, but, to be outspoken, I\u2019ve had several trades. I\u2019ve been an itinerant singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard, and dance on a rope like Blondin. Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics, so as to make better use of my talents; and then I was a sergeant fireman at Paris, and assisted at many a big fire. But I quitted France five years ago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life, took service as a valet here in England. Finding myself out of place, and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact and settled gentleman in the United Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in the hope of living with him a tranquil life, and forgetting even the name of Passepartout.\u201d\n\n\u201cPassepartout suits me,\u201d responded Mr. Fogg. \u201cYou are well recommended to me; I hear a good report of you. You know my conditions?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! What time is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-two minutes after eleven,\u201d returned Passepartout, drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket.\n\n\u201cYou are too slow,\u201d said Mr. Fogg.\n\n\u201cPardon me, monsieur, it is impossible\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are four minutes too slow. No matter; it\u2019s enough to mention the error. Now from this moment, twenty-nine minutes after eleven, a.m., this Wednesday, 2nd October, you are in my service.\u201d\n\nPhileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his head with an automatic motion, and went off without a word.\n\nPassepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new master going out. He heard it shut again; it was his predecessor, James Forster, departing in his turn. Passepartout remained alone in the house in Saville Row.",
    "The distance between Suez and Aden is precisely thirteen hundred and ten miles, and the regulations of the company allow the steamers one hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse it. The \u201cMongolia,\u201d thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, seemed likely, so rapid was her speed, to reach her destination considerably within that time. The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India some for Bombay, others for Calcutta by way of Bombay, the nearest route thither, now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula. Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades, the latter being either attached to the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy troops, and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India Company: for the sub-lieutenants get \u00a3280, brigadiers, \u00a32,400, and generals of divisions, \u00a34,000. What with the military men, a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the purser, the time passed quickly on the \u201cMongolia.\u201d The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the eight o\u2019clock supper, and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day; and the hours were whirled away, when the sea was tranquil, with music, dancing, and games.\n\nBut the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like most long and narrow gulfs. When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the \u201cMongolia,\u201d with her long hull, rolled fearfully. Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased. Yet the good ship ploughed straight on, unretarded by wind or wave, towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.\n\nWhat was Phileas Fogg doing all this time? It might be thought that, in his anxiety, he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind, the disorderly raging of the billows\u2014every chance, in short, which might force the \u201cMongolia\u201d to slacken her speed, and thus interrupt his journey. But, if he thought of these possibilities, he did not betray the fact by any outward sign.\n\nAlways the same impassible member of the Reform Club, whom no incident could surprise, as unvarying as the ship\u2019s chronometers, and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck, he passed through the memorable scenes of the Red Sea with cold indifference; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which, along its borders, raised their picturesque outlines against the sky; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the Arabic Gulf, which the old historians always spoke of with horror, and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices. How did this eccentric personage pass his time on the \u201cMongolia\u201d? He made his four hearty meals every day, regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer; and he played whist indefatigably, for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself. A tax-collector, on the way to his post at Goa; the Rev. Decimus Smith, returning to his parish at Bombay; and a brigadier-general of the English army, who was about to rejoin his brigade at Benares, made up the party, and, with Mr. Fogg, played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence.\n\nAs for Passepartout, he, too, had escaped sea-sickness, and took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin. He rather enjoyed the voyage, for he was well fed and well lodged, took a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing, and consoled himself with the delusion that his master\u2019s whim would end at Bombay. He was pleased, on the day after leaving Suez, to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays.\n\n\u201cIf I am not mistaken,\u201d said he, approaching this person, with his most amiable smile, \u201cyou are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at Suez?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! I quite recognise you. You are the servant of the strange Englishman\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJust so, monsieur\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFix.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsieur Fix,\u201d resumed Passepartout, \u201cI\u2019m charmed to find you on board. Where are you bound?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike you, to Bombay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s capital! Have you made this trip before?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral times. I am one of the agents of the Peninsular Company.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you know India?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy yes,\u201d replied Fix, who spoke cautiously.\n\n\u201cA curious place, this India?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very curious. Mosques, minarets, temples, fakirs, pagodas, tigers, snakes, elephants! I hope you will have ample time to see the sights.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope so, Monsieur Fix. You see, a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train, and from a railway train upon a steamer again, pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days! No; all these gymnastics, you may be sure, will cease at Bombay.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mr. Fogg is getting on well?\u201d asked Fix, in the most natural tone in the world.\n\n\u201cQuite well, and I too. I eat like a famished ogre; it\u2019s the sea air.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I never see your master on deck.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever; he hasn\u2019t the least curiosity.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know, Mr. Passepartout, that this pretended tour in eighty days may conceal some secret errand\u2014perhaps a diplomatic mission?\u201d\n\n\u201cFaith, Monsieur Fix, I assure you I know nothing about it, nor would I give half a crown to find out.\u201d\n\nAfter this meeting, Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting together, the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man\u2019s confidence. He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale in the steamer bar-room, which Passepartout never failed to accept with graceful alacrity, mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows.\n\nMeanwhile the \u201cMongolia\u201d was pushing forward rapidly; on the 13th, Mocha, surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing, was sighted, and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields. Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place, and thought that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort, it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer. The following night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which means in Arabic \u201cThe Bridge of Tears,\u201d and the next day they put in at Steamer Point, north-west of Aden harbour, to take in coal. This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year. In these distant seas, coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton.\n\nThe \u201cMongolia\u201d had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up. But this delay, as it was foreseen, did not affect Phileas Fogg\u2019s programme; besides, the \u201cMongolia,\u201d instead of reaching Aden on the morning of the 15th, when she was due, arrived there on the evening of the 14th, a gain of fifteen hours.",
    "The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening. The next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which, on consulting his watch, he replied that it was three in the morning. This famous timepiece, always regulated on the Greenwich meridian, which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward, was at least four hours slow. Sir Francis corrected Passepartout\u2019s time, whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian, since he was constantly going eastward, that is in the face of the sun, and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over, Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch, which he kept at London time. It was an innocent delusion which could harm no one.\n\nThe train stopped, at eight o\u2019clock, in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond Rothal, where there were several bungalows, and workmen\u2019s cabins. The conductor, passing along the carriages, shouted, \u201cPassengers will get out here!\u201d\n\nPhileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation; but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias.\n\nPassepartout, not less surprised, rushed out and speedily returned, crying: \u201cMonsieur, no more railway!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Sir Francis.\n\n\u201cI mean to say that the train isn\u2019t going on.\u201d\n\nThe general at once stepped out, while Phileas Fogg calmly followed him, and they proceeded together to the conductor.\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d asked Sir Francis.\n\n\u201cAt the hamlet of Kholby.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we stop here?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. The railway isn\u2019t finished.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! not finished?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. There\u2019s still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to Allahabad, where the line begins again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you have, officer? The papers were mistaken.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta,\u201d retorted Sir Francis, who was growing warm.\n\n\u201cNo doubt,\u201d replied the conductor; \u201cbut the passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad.\u201d\n\nSir Francis was furious. Passepartout would willingly have knocked the conductor down, and did not dare to look at his master.\n\n\u201cSir Francis,\u201d said Mr. Fogg quietly, \u201cwe will, if you please, look about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Fogg, this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Sir Francis; it was foreseen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! You knew that the way\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or later arise on my route. Nothing, therefore, is lost. I have two days, which I have already gained, to sacrifice. A steamer leaves Calcutta for Hong Kong at noon, on the 25th. This is the 22nd, and we shall reach Calcutta in time.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing to say to so confident a response.\n\nIt was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point. The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line. The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption, and, leaving the train, they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis, waggons drawn by zebus, carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas, palanquins, ponies, and what not.\n\nMr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village from end to end, came back without having found anything.\n\n\u201cI shall go afoot,\u201d said Phileas Fogg.\n\nPassepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry grimace, as he thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian shoes. Happily he too had been looking about him, and, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, said, \u201cMonsieur, I think I have found a means of conveyance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn elephant! An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and see the elephant,\u201d replied Mr. Fogg.\n\nThey soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within some high palings, was the animal in question. An Indian came out of the hut, and, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure. The elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but for warlike purposes, was half domesticated. The Indian had begun already, by often irritating him, and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter, to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature, this method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for battle. Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal\u2019s instruction in this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness. Kiouni\u2014this was the name of the beast\u2014could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other means of conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him. But elephants are far from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males, which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially as but few of them are domesticated. When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank. Mr. Fogg persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad. Refused. Twenty pounds? Refused also. Forty pounds? Still refused. Passepartout jumped at each advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted. Yet the offer was an alluring one, for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad, his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling.\n\nPhileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed to purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds for him. The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain, still refused.\n\nSir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value. Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with avarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain. Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds. Passepartout, usually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense.\n\nAt two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.\n\n\u201cWhat a price, good heavens!\u201d cried Passepartout, \u201cfor an elephant.\u201d\n\nIt only remained now to find a guide, which was comparatively easy. A young Parsee, with an intelligent face, offered his services, which Mr. Fogg accepted, promising so generous a reward as to materially stimulate his zeal.",
    "The Parsee\u2019s narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous design. It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible. They halted, half an hour afterwards, in a copse, some five hundred feet from the pagoda, where they were well concealed; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly.\n\nThey then discussed the means of getting at the victim. The guide was familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji, in which, as he declared, the young woman was imprisoned. Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep, or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls? This could only be determined at the moment and the place themselves; but it was certain that the abduction must be made that night, and not when, at break of day, the victim was led to her funeral pyre. Then no human intervention could save her.\n\nAs soon as night fell, about six o\u2019clock, they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda. The cries of the fakirs were just ceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself.\n\nThe Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through the wood, and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream, whence, by the light of the rosin torches, they perceived a pyre of wood, on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah, which was to be burned with his wife. The pagoda, whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk, stood a hundred steps away.\n\n\u201cCome!\u201d whispered the guide.\n\nHe slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed by his companions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches.\n\nSoon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was lit up by the torches. The ground was covered by groups of the Indians, motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with the dead. Men, women, and children lay together.\n\nIn the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed distinctly. Much to the guide\u2019s disappointment, the guards of the rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests, too, were watching within.\n\nThe Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple, advanced no farther, but led his companions back again. Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also saw that nothing could be attempted in that direction. They stopped, and engaged in a whispered colloquy.\n\n\u201cIt is only eight now,\u201d said the brigadier, \u201cand these guards may also go to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not impossible,\u201d returned the Parsee.\n\nThey lay down at the foot of a tree, and waited.\n\nThe time seemed long; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood, but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches, and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda.\n\nThey waited till midnight; but no change took place among the guards, and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be counted on. The other plan must be carried out; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made. It remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door.\n\nAfter a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt, and advanced, followed by the others. They took a roundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear. They reached the walls about half-past twelve, without having met anyone; here there was no guard, nor were there either windows or doors.\n\nThe night was dark. The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon, and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the darkness.\n\nIt was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives. Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood, which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had been taken out, the rest would yield easily.\n\nThey set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide. They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside. Passepartout and the guide stopped. Had they been heard? Was the alarm being given? Common prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis. They again hid themselves in the wood, and waited till the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay. But, awkwardly enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise.\n\nIt would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus interrupted in their work. They could not now reach the victim; how, then, could they save her? Sir Francis shook his fists, Passepartout was beside himself, and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage. The tranquil Fogg waited, without betraying any emotion.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to do but to go away,\u201d whispered Sir Francis.\n\n\u201cNothing but to go away,\u201d echoed the guide.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d said Fogg. \u201cI am only due at Allahabad tomorrow before noon.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what can you hope to do?\u201d asked Sir Francis. \u201cIn a few hours it will be daylight, and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last moment.\u201d\n\nSir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg\u2019s eyes. What was this cool Englishman thinking of? Was he planning to make a rush for the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice, and boldly snatch her from her executioners?\n\nThis would be utter folly, and it was hard to admit that Fogg was such a fool. Sir Francis consented, however, to remain to the end of this terrible drama. The guide led them to the rear of the glade, where they were able to observe the sleeping groups.\n\nMeanwhile Passepartout, who had perched himself on the lower branches of a tree, was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a flash, and which was now firmly lodged in his brain.\n\nHe had commenced by saying to himself, \u201cWhat folly!\u201d and then he repeated, \u201cWhy not, after all? It\u2019s a chance,\u2014perhaps the only one; and with such sots!\u201d Thinking thus, he slipped, with the suppleness of a serpent, to the lowest branches, the ends of which bent almost to the ground.\n\nThe hours passed, and the lighter shades now announced the approach of day, though it was not yet light. This was the moment. The slumbering multitude became animated, the tambourines sounded, songs and cries arose; the hour of the sacrifice had come. The doors of the pagoda swung open, and a bright light escaped from its interior, in the midst of which Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis espied the victim. She seemed, having shaken off the stupor of intoxication, to be striving to escape from her executioner. Sir Francis\u2019s heart throbbed; and, convulsively seizing Mr. Fogg\u2019s hand, found in it an open knife. Just at this moment the crowd began to move. The young woman had again fallen into a stupor caused by the fumes of hemp, and passed among the fakirs, who escorted her with their wild, religious cries.\n\nPhileas Fogg and his companions, mingling in the rear ranks of the crowd, followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the stream, and stopped fifty paces from the pyre, upon which still lay the rajah\u2019s corpse. In the semi-obscurity they saw the victim, quite senseless, stretched out beside her husband\u2019s body. Then a torch was brought, and the wood, heavily soaked with oil, instantly took fire.\n\nAt this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg, who, in an instant of mad generosity, was about to rush upon the pyre. But he had quickly pushed them aside, when the whole scene suddenly changed. A cry of terror arose. The whole multitude prostrated themselves, terror-stricken, on the ground.\n\nThe old rajah was not dead, then, since he rose of a sudden, like a spectre, took up his wife in his arms, and descended from the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke, which only heightened his ghostly appearance.",
    "The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house, which, however, did not have the appearance of a private mansion. The policeman having requested his prisoners\u2014for so, truly, they might be called\u2014to descend, conducted them into a room with barred windows, and said: \u201cYou will appear before Judge Obadiah at half-past eight.\u201d\n\nHe then retired, and closed the door.\n\n\u201cWhy, we are prisoners!\u201d exclaimed Passepartout, falling into a chair.\n\nAouda, with an emotion she tried to conceal, said to Mr. Fogg: \u201cSir, you must leave me to my fate! It is on my account that you receive this treatment, it is for having saved me!\u201d\n\nPhileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible. It was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee. The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge. There was some mistake. Moreover, he would not, in any event, abandon Aouda, but would escort her to Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cBut the steamer leaves at noon!\u201d observed Passepartout, nervously.\n\n\u201cWe shall be on board by noon,\u201d replied his master, placidly.\n\nIt was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering to himself, \u201cParbleu that\u2019s certain! Before noon we shall be on board.\u201d But he was by no means reassured.\n\nAt half-past eight the door opened, the policeman appeared, and, requesting them to follow him, led the way to an adjoining hall. It was evidently a court-room, and a crowd of Europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment.\n\nMr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk. Immediately after, Judge Obadiah, a fat, round man, followed by the clerk, entered. He proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail, and put it hurriedly on his head.\n\n\u201cThe first case,\u201d said he. Then, putting his hand to his head, he exclaimed, \u201cHeh! This is not my wig!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, your worship,\u201d returned the clerk, \u201cit is mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Oysterpuff, how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerk\u2019s wig?\u201d\n\nThe wigs were exchanged.\n\nPassepartout was getting nervous, for the hands on the face of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity.\n\n\u201cThe first case,\u201d repeated Judge Obadiah.\n\n\u201cPhileas Fogg?\u201d demanded Oysterpuff.\n\n\u201cI am here,\u201d replied Mr. Fogg.\n\n\u201cPassepartout?\u201d\n\n\u201cPresent,\u201d responded Passepartout.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the judge. \u201cYou have been looked for, prisoners, for two days on the trains from Bombay.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut of what are we accused?\u201d asked Passepartout, impatiently.\n\n\u201cYou are about to be informed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am an English subject, sir,\u201d said Mr. Fogg, \u201cand I have the right\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you been ill-treated?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well; let the complainants come in.\u201d\n\nA door was swung open by order of the judge, and three Indian priests entered.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d muttered Passepartout; \u201cthese are the rogues who were going to burn our young lady.\u201d\n\nThe priests took their places in front of the judge, and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against Phileas Fogg and his servant, who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion.\n\n\u201cYou hear the charge?\u201d asked the judge.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Fogg, consulting his watch, \u201cand I admit it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou admit it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI admit it, and I wish to hear these priests admit, in their turn, what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji.\u201d\n\nThe priests looked at each other; they did not seem to understand what was said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d cried Passepartout, warmly; \u201cat the pagoda of Pillaji, where they were on the point of burning their victim.\u201d\n\nThe judge stared with astonishment, and the priests were stupefied.\n\n\u201cWhat victim?\u201d said Judge Obadiah. \u201cBurn whom? In Bombay itself?\u201d\n\n\u201cBombay?\u201d cried Passepartout.\n\n\u201cCertainly. We are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji, but of the pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd as a proof,\u201d added the clerk, \u201chere are the desecrator\u2019s very shoes, which he left behind him.\u201d\n\nWhereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk.\n\n\u201cMy shoes!\u201d cried Passepartout, in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him.\n\nThe confusion of master and man, who had quite forgotten the affair at Bombay, for which they were now detained at Calcutta, may be imagined.\n\nFix the detective, had foreseen the advantage which Passepartout\u2019s escapade gave him, and, delaying his departure for twelve hours, had consulted the priests of Malabar Hill. Knowing that the English authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour, he promised them a goodly sum in damages, and sent them forward to Calcutta by the next train. Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow, Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before Mr. Fogg and his servant, the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive. Fix\u2019s disappointment when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta may be imagined. He made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces. For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety; at last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive, accompanied by a young woman, whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain. He hastened for a policeman; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah.\n\nHad Passepartout been a little less preoccupied, he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room, watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood; for the warrant had failed to reach him at Calcutta, as it had done at Bombay and Suez.\n\nJudge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout\u2019s rash exclamation, which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall.\n\n\u201cThe facts are admitted?\u201d asked the judge.\n\n\u201cAdmitted,\u201d replied Mr. Fogg, coldly.\n\n\u201cInasmuch,\u201d resumed the judge, \u201cas the English law protects equally and sternly the religions of the Indian people, and as the man Passepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay, on the 20th of October, I condemn the said Passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree hundred pounds!\u201d cried Passepartout, startled at the largeness of the sum.\n\n\u201cSilence!\u201d shouted the constable.\n\n\u201cAnd inasmuch,\u201d continued the judge, \u201cas it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant, and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant, I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week\u2019s imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds.\u201d\n\nFix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg could be detained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive. Passepartout was stupefied. This sentence ruined his master. A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost, because he, like a precious fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda!",
    "Passepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards the Victoria port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance, and the groups of Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets. Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike Bombay, Calcutta, and Singapore, since, like them, it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English supremacy. At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations: English, French, American, and Dutch, men-of-war and trading vessels, Japanese and Chinese junks, sempas, tankas, and flower-boats, which formed so many floating parterres. Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow. On going into a barber\u2019s to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old, at which age they are permitted to wear yellow, which is the Imperial colour. Passepartout, without exactly knowing why, thought this very funny.\n\nOn reaching the quay where they were to embark on the \u201cCarnatic,\u201d he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down. The detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed.\n\n\u201cThis is bad,\u201d muttered Passepartout, \u201cfor the gentlemen of the Reform Club!\u201d He accosted Fix with a merry smile, as if he had not perceived that gentleman\u2019s chagrin. The detective had, indeed, good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him. The warrant had not come! It was certainly on the way, but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong for several days; and, this being the last English territory on Mr. Fogg\u2019s route, the robber would escape, unless he could manage to detain him.\n\n\u201cWell, Monsieur Fix,\u201d said Passepartout, \u201chave you decided to go with us so far as America?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Fix, through his set teeth.\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d exclaimed Passepartout, laughing heartily. \u201cI knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from us. Come and engage your berth.\u201d\n\nThey entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons. The clerk, as he gave them the tickets, informed them that, the repairs on the \u201cCarnatic\u201d having been completed, the steamer would leave that very evening, and not next morning, as had been announced.\n\n\u201cThat will suit my master all the better,\u201d said Passepartout. \u201cI will go and let him know.\u201d\n\nFix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout all. It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg several days longer at Hong Kong. He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay. On entering, they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated, at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions. Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep. At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin, and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose. From time to time one of the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, carried and laid him upon the bed. The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots.\n\nFix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds\u2014thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity! The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws. It passed gradually from the rich, to whom it was at first exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages could not be arrested. Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he dies in five years. It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found themselves. Passepartout had no money, but willingly accepted Fix\u2019s invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time.\n\nThey ordered two bottles of port, to which the Frenchman did ample justice, whilst Fix observed him with close attention. They chatted about the journey, and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea that Fix was going to continue it with them. When the bottles were empty, however, he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the \u201cCarnatic.\u201d\n\nFix caught him by the arm, and said, \u201cWait a moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for, Mr. Fix?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to have a serious talk with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cA serious talk!\u201d cried Passepartout, drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow; I haven\u2019t time now.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay! What I have to say concerns your master.\u201d\n\nPassepartout, at this, looked attentively at his companion. Fix\u2019s face seemed to have a singular expression. He resumed his seat.\n\n\u201cWhat is it that you have to say?\u201d\n\nFix placed his hand upon Passepartout\u2019s arm, and, lowering his voice, said, \u201cYou have guessed who I am?\u201d\n\n\u201cParbleu!\u201d said Passepartout, smiling.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019m going to tell you everything\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that I know everything, my friend! Ah! that\u2019s very good. But go on, go on. First, though, let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense.\u201d\n\n\u201cUseless!\u201d said Fix. \u201cYou speak confidently. It\u2019s clear that you don\u2019t know how large the sum is.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d returned Passepartout. \u201cTwenty thousand pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty-five thousand!\u201d answered Fix, pressing his companion\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Frenchman. \u201cHas Monsieur Fogg dared\u2014fifty-five thousand pounds! Well, there\u2019s all the more reason for not losing an instant,\u201d he continued, getting up hastily.\n\nFix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: \u201cFifty-five thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you\u2019ll help me, I\u2019ll let you have five hundred of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp you?\u201d cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide open.\n\n\u201cYes; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put obstacles in his way! I blush for them!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They might as well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what we count on doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conspiracy, then,\u201d cried Passepartout, who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without perceiving it. \u201cA real conspiracy! And gentlemen, too. Bah!\u201d\n\nFix began to be puzzled.",
    "The \u201cTankadere\u201d entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the night, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer. The sea was very rough in the straits, full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the chopping waves broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck.\n\nAt daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed to predict a gale. The barometer announced a speedy change, the mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest. The sun had set the evening before in a red mist, in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean.\n\n\nJohn Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens, muttering indistinctly between his teeth. At last he said in a low voice to Mr. Fogg, \u201cShall I speak out to your honour?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, we are going to have a squall.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIs the wind north or south?\u201d asked Mr. Fogg quietly.\n\n\n\u201cSouth. Look! a typhoon is coming up.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGlad it\u2019s a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, if you take it that way,\u201d said John Bunsby, \u201cI\u2019ve nothing more to say.\u201d John Bunsby\u2019s suspicions were confirmed. At a less advanced season of the year the typhoon, according to a famous meteorologist, would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violence.\n\n\nThe pilot took his precautions in advance. He reefed all sail, the pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the bows. A single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as a storm-jib, so as to hold the wind from behind. Then they waited.\n\n\nJohn Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat bouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant. Neither Mr. Fogg, Fix, nor Aouda consented to leave the deck.\n\n\nThe storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o\u2019clock. With but its bit of sail, the \u201cTankadere\u201d was lifted like a feather by a wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given. To compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth.\n\n\nThe boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to theirs. Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of the pilot saved her. The passengers were often bathed in spray, but they submitted to it philosophically. Fix cursed it, no doubt; but Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm. As for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programme.\n\n\nUp to this time the \u201cTankadere\u201d had always held her course to the north; but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, bore down from the north-west. The boat, now lying in the trough of the waves, shook and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence. At night the tempest increased in violence. John Bunsby saw the approach of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings. He thought awhile, and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken speed. After a consultation he approached Mr. Fogg, and said, \u201cI think, your honour, that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the coast.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think so too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the pilot. \u201cBut which one?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know of but one,\u201d returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly.\n\n\n\u201cAnd that is\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShanghai.\u201d\n\n\nThe pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely realise so much determination and tenacity. Then he cried, \u201cWell\u2014yes! Your honour is right. To Shanghai!\u201d\n\n\nSo the \u201cTankadere\u201d kept steadily on her northward track.\n\n\nThe night was really terrible; it would be a miracle if the craft did not founder. Twice it could have been all over with her if the crew had not been constantly on the watch. Aouda was exhausted, but did not utter a complaint. More than once Mr. Fogg rushed to protect her from the violence of the waves.\n\n\nDay reappeared. The tempest still raged with undiminished fury; but the wind now returned to the south-east. It was a favourable change, and the \u201cTankadere\u201d again bounded forward on this mountainous sea, though the waves crossed each other, and imparted shocks and counter-shocks which would have crushed a craft less solidly built. From time to time the coast was visible through the broken mist, but no vessel was in sight. The \u201cTankadere\u201d was alone upon the sea.\n\n\nThere were some signs of a calm at noon, and these became more distinct as the sun descended toward the horizon. The tempest had been as brief as terrific. The passengers, thoroughly exhausted, could now eat a little, and take some repose.\n\n\nThe night was comparatively quiet. Some of the sails were again hoisted, and the speed of the boat was very good.",
    "The next morning poor, jaded, famished Passepartout said to himself that he must get something to eat at all hazards, and the sooner he did so the better. He might, indeed, sell his watch; but he would have starved first. Now or never he must use the strong, if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon him. He knew several French and English songs, and resolved to try them upon the Japanese, who must be lovers of music, since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals, tam-tams, and tambourines, and could not but appreciate European talent.\n\n\nIt was, perhaps, rather early in the morning to get up a concert, and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers, might not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikado\u2019s features. Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours; and, as he was sauntering along, it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist. The idea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; by which he might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger. The resolution taken, it remained to carry it out.\n\n\nIt was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a native dealer in old clothes, to whom he applied for an exchange. The man liked the European costume, and ere long Passepartout issued from his shop accoutred in an old Japanese coat, and a sort of one-sided turban, faded with long use. A few small pieces of silver, moreover, jingled in his pocket.\n\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d thought he. \u201cI will imagine I am at the Carnival!\u201d\n\n\nHis first care, after being thus \u201cJapanesed,\u201d was to enter a tea-house of modest appearance, and, upon half a bird and a little rice, to breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a problem to be solved.\n\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d thought he, when he had eaten heartily, \u201cI mustn\u2019t lose my head. I can\u2019t sell this costume again for one still more Japanese. I must consider how to leave this country of the Sun, of which I shall not retain the most delightful of memories, as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\nIt occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to leave for America. He would offer himself as a cook or servant, in payment of his passage and meals. Once at San Francisco, he would find some means of going on. The difficulty was, how to traverse the four thousand seven hundred miles of the Pacific which lay between Japan and the New World.\n\n\nPassepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging, and directed his steps towards the docks. But, as he approached them, his project, which at first had seemed so simple, began to grow more and more formidable to his mind. What need would they have of a cook or servant on an American steamer, and what confidence would they put in him, dressed as he was? What references could he give?\n\n\nAs he was reflecting in this wise, his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets. This placard, which was in English, read as follows:\n\nACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE,\nHONOURABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR, PROPRIETOR,\nLAST REPRESENTATIONS,\nPRIOR TO THEIR DEPARTURE TO THE UNITED STATES,\nOF THE\nLONG NOSES! LONG NOSES!\nUNDER THE DIRECT PATRONAGE OF THE GOD TINGOU!\nGREAT ATTRACTION!\n\n\n\u201cThe United States!\u201d said Passepartout; \u201cthat\u2019s just what I want!\u201d\n\n\nHe followed the clown, and soon found himself once more in the Japanese quarter. A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin, adorned with several clusters of streamers, the exterior walls of which were designed to represent, in violent colours and without perspective, a company of jugglers.\n\n\nThis was the Honourable William Batulcar\u2019s establishment. That gentleman was a sort of Barnum, the director of a troupe of mountebanks, jugglers, clowns, acrobats, equilibrists, and gymnasts, who, according to the placard, was giving his last performances before leaving the Empire of the Sun for the States of the Union.\n\n\nPassepartout entered and asked for Mr. Batulcar, who straightway appeared in person.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d said he to Passepartout, whom he at first took for a native.\n\n\n\u201cWould you like a servant, sir?\u201d asked Passepartout.\n\n\n\u201cA servant!\u201d cried Mr. Batulcar, caressing the thick grey beard which hung from his chin. \u201cI already have two who are obedient and faithful, have never left me, and serve me for their nourishment and here they are,\u201d added he, holding out his two robust arms, furrowed with veins as large as the strings of a bass-viol.\n\n\n\u201cSo I can be of no use to you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe devil! I should so like to cross the Pacific with you!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the Honourable Mr. Batulcar. \u201cYou are no more a Japanese than I am a monkey! Who are you dressed up in that way?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA man dresses as he can.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. You are a Frenchman, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes; a Parisian of Paris.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen you ought to know how to make grimaces?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d replied Passepartout, a little vexed that his nationality should cause this question, \u201cwe Frenchmen know how to make grimaces, it is true but not any better than the Americans do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTrue. Well, if I can\u2019t take you as a servant, I can as a clown. You see, my friend, in France they exhibit foreign clowns, and in foreign parts French clowns.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou are pretty strong, eh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEspecially after a good meal.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd you can sing?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Passepartout, who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets.\n\n\n\u201cBut can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHumph! I think so,\u201d replied Passepartout, recalling the exercises of his younger days.\n\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s enough,\u201d said the Honourable William Batulcar.\n\n\nThe engagement was concluded there and then. Passepartout had at last found something to do. He was engaged to act in the celebrated Japanese troupe. It was not a very dignified position, but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco.\n\n\nThe performance, so noisily announced by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar, was to commence at three o\u2019clock, and soon the deafening instruments of a Japanese orchestra resounded at the door. Passepartout, though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part, was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the \u201chuman pyramid,\u201d executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou. This \u201cgreat attraction\u201d was to close the performance.\n\n\nBefore three o\u2019clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators, comprising Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and children, who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage. The musicians took up a position inside, and were vigorously performing on their gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones, tambourines, and immense drums.\n\n\nThe performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world. One, with a fan and some bits of paper, performed the graceful trick of the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air, with the odorous smoke of his pipe, a series of blue words, which composed a compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted candles, which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips, and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling. Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top; in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems, the edges of sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo ladders, dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of tone. The jugglers tossed them in the air, threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores, and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets, and took them out still whirling as before.\n\n\nIt is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts. The turning on ladders, poles, balls, barrels, &c., was executed with wonderful precision. But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long Noses, a show to which Europe is as yet a stranger.\n\n\nThe Long Noses form a peculiar company, under the direct patronage of the god Tingou. Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages, they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces, and the uses which they made of them. These noses were made of bamboo, and were five, six, and even ten feet long, some straight, others curved, some ribboned, and some having imitation warts upon them. It was upon these appendages, fixed tightly on their real noses, that they performed their gymnastic exercises. A dozen of these sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses, jumping from one to another, and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults.\n\n\nAs a last scene, a \u201chuman pyramid\u201d had been announced, in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut. But, instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other\u2019s shoulders, the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses. It happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the troupe, and as, to fill this part, only strength and adroitness were necessary, Passepartout had been chosen to take his place.\n\n\nThe poor fellow really felt sad when\u2014melancholy reminiscence of his youth!\u2014he donned his costume, adorned with vari-coloured wings, and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long. But he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat. He went upon the stage, and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut. They all stretched themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling. A second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages, then a third above these, then a fourth, until a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses. This elicited loud applause, in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air, when the pyramid tottered, the balance was lost, one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid, and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards!\n\n\nIt was Passepartout\u2019s fault. Abandoning his position, clearing the footlights without the aid of his wings, and, clambering up to the right-hand gallery, he fell at the feet of one of the spectators, crying, \u201cAh, my master! my master!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou here?\u201d\n\n\u201cMyself.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well; then let us go to the steamer, young man!\u201d\n\nMr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout passed through the lobby of the theatre to the outside, where they encountered the Honourable Mr. Batulcar, furious with rage. He demanded damages for the \u201cbreakage\u201d of the pyramid; and Phileas Fogg appeased him by giving him a handful of banknotes. At half-past six, the very hour of departure, Mr. Fogg and Aouda, followed by Passepartout, who in his hurry had retained his wings, and nose six feet long, stepped upon the American steamer.",
    "From his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the wide streets, the low, evenly ranged houses, the Anglo-Saxon Gothic churches, the great docks, the palatial wooden and brick warehouses, the numerous conveyances, omnibuses, horse-cars, and upon the side-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese and Indians. Passepartout was surprised at all he saw. San Francisco was no longer the legendary city of 1849\u2014a city of banditti, assassins, and incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a paradise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial emporium.\n\n\nThe lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the streets and avenues, which cut each other at right-angles, and in the midst of which appeared pleasant, verdant squares, while beyond appeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported from the Celestial Empire in a toy-box. Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of nervously active, gentlemanly-looking men. Some of the streets\u2014especially Montgomery Street, which is to San Francisco what Regent Street is to London, the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris, and Broadway to New York\u2014were lined with splendid and spacious stores, which exposed in their windows the products of the entire world.\n\n\nWhen Passepartout reached the International Hotel, it did not seem to him as if he had left England at all.\n\n\nThe ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar, a sort of restaurant freely open to all passers-by, who might partake of dried beef, oyster soup, biscuits, and cheese, without taking out their purses. Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or sherry which was drunk. This seemed \u201cvery American\u201d to Passepartout. The hotel refreshment-rooms were comfortable, and Mr. Fogg and Aouda, installing themselves at a table, were abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes of darkest hue.\n\n\nAfter breakfast, Mr. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for the English consulate to have his passport _visaed_. As he was going out, he met Passepartout, who asked him if it would not be well, before taking the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt\u2019s revolvers. He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains by the Sioux and Pawnees. Mr. Fogg thought it a useless precaution, but told him to do as he thought best, and went on to the consulate.\n\n\nHe had not proceeded two hundred steps, however, when, \u201cby the greatest chance in the world,\u201d he met Fix. The detective seemed wholly taken by surprise. What! Had Mr. Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific together, and not met on the steamer! At least Fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much, and, as his business recalled him to Europe, he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company.\n\n\nMr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective\u2014who was determined not to lose sight of him\u2014begged permission to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco\u2014a request which Mr. Fogg readily granted.\n\n\nThey soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great crowd was collected; the side-walks, street, horsecar rails, the shop-doors, the windows of the houses, and even the roofs, were full of people. Men were going about carrying large posters, and flags and streamers were floating in the wind; while loud cries were heard on every hand.\n\n\n\u201cHurrah for Camerfield!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHurrah for Mandiboy!\u201d\n\n\nIt was a political meeting; at least so Fix conjectured, who said to Mr. Fogg, \u201cPerhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd. There may be danger in it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Mr. Fogg; \u201cand blows, even if they are political, are still blows.\u201d\n\n\nFix smiled at this remark; and, in order to be able to see without being jostled about, the party took up a position on the top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street. Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been erected in the open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed.\n\n\nFor what purpose was this meeting? What was the occasion of this excited assemblage? Phileas Fogg could not imagine. Was it to nominate some high official\u2014a governor or member of Congress? It was not improbable, so agitated was the multitude before them.\n\n\nJust at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass. All the hands were raised in the air. Some, tightly closed, seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries\u2014an energetic way, no doubt, of casting a vote. The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters. The undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall. Many of the black hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height.\n\n\n\u201cIt is evidently a meeting,\u201d said Fix, \u201cand its object must be an exciting one. I should not wonder if it were about the \u2018Alabama,\u2019 despite the fact that that question is settled.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d replied Mr. Fogg, simply.\n\n\n\u201cAt least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy.\u201d\n\n\nAouda, leaning upon Mr. Fogg\u2019s arm, observed the tumultuous scene with surprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was. Before the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction. Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd. Boots and shoes went whirling through the air, and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din, the rout approached the stairway, and flowed over the lower step. One of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but the mere lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the upper hand.\n\n\n\u201cIt would be prudent for us to retire,\u201d said Fix, who was anxious that Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they got back to London. \u201cIf there is any question about England in all this, and we were recognised, I fear it would go hard with us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAn English subject\u2014\u201d began Mr. Fogg. He did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood, and there were frantic shouts of, \u201cHurrah for Mandiboy! Hip, hip, hurrah!\u201d\n\n\nIt was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, and taking the Camerfield forces in flank. Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix found themselves between two fires; it was too late to escape. The torrent of men, armed with loaded canes and sticks, was irresistible. Phileas Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair companion; the former, as cool as ever, tried to defend himself with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every Englishman\u2019s arm, but in vain. A big brawny fellow with a red beard, flushed face, and broad shoulders, who seemed to be the chief of the band, raised his clenched fist to strike Mr. Fogg, whom he would have given a crushing blow, had not Fix rushed in and received it in his stead. An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective\u2019s silk hat, which was completely smashed in.\n\n\n\u201cYankee!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian.\n\n\n\u201cEnglishman!\u201d returned the other. \u201cWe will meet again!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen you please.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPhileas Fogg. And yours?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cColonel Stamp Proctor.\u201d\n\n\nThe human tide now swept by, after overturning Fix, who speedily got upon his feet again, though with tattered clothes. Happily, he was not seriously hurt. His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts, and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians, which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on. Aouda had escaped unharmed, and Fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue bruise.\n\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Mr. Fogg to the detective, as soon as they were out of the crowd.\n\n\n\u201cNo thanks are necessary,\u201d replied Fix; \u201cbut let us go.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTo a tailor\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\nSuch a visit was, indeed, opportune. The clothing of both Mr. Fogg and Fix was in rags, as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy. An hour after, they were once more suitably attired, and with Aouda returned to the International Hotel.",
    "At eleven o\u2019clock the locomotive\u2019s whistle announced that they were approaching Plum Creek station. Mr. Fogg rose, and, followed by Fix, went out upon the platform. Passepartout accompanied him, carrying a pair of revolvers. Aouda remained in the car, as pale as death.\n\nThe door of the next car opened, and Colonel Proctor appeared on the platform, attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second. But just as the combatants were about to step from the train, the conductor hurried up, and shouted, \u201cYou can\u2019t get off, gentlemen!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked the colonel.\n\n\u201cWe are twenty minutes late, and we shall not stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d said the conductor; \u201cbut we shall be off at once. There\u2019s the bell ringing now.\u201d\n\nThe train started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really very sorry, gentlemen,\u201d said the conductor. \u201cUnder any other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you. But, after all, as you have not had time to fight here, why not fight as we go along?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be convenient, perhaps, for this gentleman,\u201d said the colonel, in a jeering tone.\n\n\u201cIt would be perfectly so,\u201d replied Phileas Fogg.\n\n\u201cWell, we are really in America,\u201d thought Passepartout, \u201cand the conductor is a gentleman of the first order!\u201d\n\nSo muttering, he followed his master.\n\n\nThe two combatants, their seconds, and the conductor passed through the cars to the rear of the train. The last car was only occupied by a dozen passengers, whom the conductor politely asked if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments, as two gentlemen had an affair of honour to settle. The passengers granted the request with alacrity, and straightway disappeared on the platform.\n\nThe car, which was some fifty feet long, was very convenient for their purpose. The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle, and fire at their ease. Never was duel more easily arranged. Mr. Fogg and Colonel Proctor, each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers, entered the car. The seconds, remaining outside, shut them in. They were to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive. After an interval of two minutes, what remained of the two gentlemen would be taken from the car.\n\nNothing could be more simple. Indeed, it was all so simple that Fix and Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack. They were listening for the whistle agreed upon, when suddenly savage cries resounded in the air, accompanied by reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the duellists were. The reports continued in front and the whole length of the train. Cries of terror proceeded from the interior of the cars.\n\n\nColonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg, revolvers in hand, hastily quitted their prison, and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous. They then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of Sioux.\n\n\nThis was not the first attempt of these daring Indians, for more than once they had waylaid trains on the road. A hundred of them had, according to their habit, jumped upon the steps without stopping the train, with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop.\n\n\nThe Sioux were armed with guns, from which came the reports, to which the passengers, who were almost all armed, responded by revolver-shots.\n\n\nThe Indians had first mounted the engine, and half stunned the engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets. A Sioux chief, wishing to stop the train, but not knowing how to work the regulator, had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve, and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity.\n\n\nThe Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and fighting hand to hand with the passengers. Penetrating the baggage-car, they pillaged it, throwing the trunks out of the train. The cries and shots were constant. The travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the cars were barricaded, and sustained a siege, like moving forts, carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour.",
    "Aouda behaved courageously from the first. She defended herself like a true heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance. Twenty Sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms. Several passengers, shot or stunned, lay on the seats.\n\n\nIt was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted for ten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the train was not stopped. Fort Kearney station, where there was a garrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once passed, the Sioux would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the station beyond.\n\n\nThe conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg, when he was shot and fell. At the same moment he cried, \u201cUnless the train is stopped in five minutes, we are lost!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt shall be stopped,\u201d said Phileas Fogg, preparing to rush from the car.\n\n\u201cStay, monsieur,\u201d cried Passepartout; \u201cI will go.\u201d\n\n\nMr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow, who, opening a door unperceived by the Indians, succeeded in slipping under the car; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other over his head, he made use of his old acrobatic experience, and with amazing agility worked his way under the cars, holding on to the chains, aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes, creeping from one car to another with marvellous skill, and thus gaining the forward end of the train.\n\n\nThere, suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender, with the other he loosened the safety chains; but, owing to the traction, he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar, had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out. The train, now detached from the engine, remained a little behind, whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed.\n\n\nCarried on by the force already acquired, the train still moved for several minutes; but the brakes were worked and at last they stopped, less than a hundred feet from Kearney station.\n\n\nThe soldiers of the fort, attracted by the shots, hurried up; the Sioux had not expected them, and decamped in a body before the train entirely stopped.\n\n\nBut when the passengers counted each other on the station platform several were found missing; among others the courageous Frenchman, whose devotion had just saved them.",
    "Phileas Fogg took a chair, and sat down near the fireplace, opposite Aouda. No emotion was visible on his face. Fogg returned was exactly the Fogg who had gone away; there was the same calm, the same impassivity.\n\n\nHe sat several minutes without speaking; then, bending his eyes on Aouda, \u201cMadam,\u201d said he, \u201cwill you pardon me for bringing you to England?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, Mr. Fogg!\u201d replied Aouda, checking the pulsations of her heart.\n\n\u201cPlease let me finish,\u201d returned Mr. Fogg. \u201cWhen I decided to bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you, I was rich, and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal; then your existence would have been free and happy. But now I am ruined.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it, Mr. Fogg,\u201d replied Aouda; \u201cand I ask you in my turn, will you forgive me for having followed you, and\u2014who knows?\u2014for having, perhaps, delayed you, and thus contributed to your ruin?\u201d\n\n\u201cMadam, you could not remain in India, and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. Fogg,\u201d resumed Aouda, \u201cnot content with rescuing me from a terrible death, you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, madam; but circumstances have been against me. Still, I beg to place the little I have left at your service.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what will become of you, Mr. Fogg?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for me, madam,\u201d replied the gentleman, coldly, \u201cI have need of nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do you look upon the fate, sir, which awaits you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I am in the habit of doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least,\u201d said Aouda, \u201cwant should not overtake a man like you. Your friends\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no friends, madam.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour relatives\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no longer any relatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pity you, then, Mr. Fogg, for solitude is a sad thing, with no heart to which to confide your griefs. They say, though, that misery itself, shared by two sympathetic souls, may be borne with patience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say so, madam.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Fogg,\u201d said Aouda, rising and seizing his hand, \u201cdo you wish at once a kinswoman and friend? Will you have me for your wife?\u201d\n\n\nMr. Fogg, at this, rose in his turn. There was an unwonted light in his eyes, and a slight trembling of his lips. Aouda looked into his face. The sincerity, rectitude, firmness, and sweetness of this soft glance of a noble woman, who could dare all to save him to whom she owed all, at first astonished, then penetrated him. He shut his eyes for an instant, as if to avoid her look. When he opened them again, \u201cI love you!\u201d he said, simply. \u201cYes, by all that is holiest, I love you, and I am entirely yours!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d cried Aouda, pressing his hand to her heart.\n\n\nPassepartout was summoned and appeared immediately. Mr. Fogg still held Aouda\u2019s hand in his own; Passepartout understood, and his big, round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith.\n\n\nMr. Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend Samuel Wilson, of Marylebone parish, that evening.\n\n\nPassepartout smiled his most genial smile, and said, \u201cNever too late.\u201d\n\nIt was five minutes past eight.\n\n\u201cWill it be for to-morrow, Monday?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor to-morrow, Monday,\u201d said Mr. Fogg, turning to Aouda.\n\n\u201cYes; for to-morrow, Monday,\u201d she replied.\n\n\nPassepartout hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him."

  "Edgar Rice Burroughs -- Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar": [
    "Lieutenant Albert Werper had only the prestige of the name he had dishonored to thank for his narrow escape from being cashiered. At first he had been humbly thankful, too, that they had sent him to this Godforsaken Congo post instead of court-martialing him, as he had so justly deserved; but now six months of the monotony, the frightful isolation and the loneliness had wrought a change. The young man brooded continually over his fate. His days were filled with morbid self-pity, which eventually engendered in his weak and vacillating mind a hatred for those who had sent him here\u2014for the very men he had at first inwardly thanked for saving him from the ignominy of degradation.\n\nHe regretted the gay life of Brussels as he never had regretted the sins which had snatched him from that gayest of capitals, and as the days passed he came to center his resentment upon the representative in Congo land of the authority which had exiled him\u2014his captain and immediate superior.\n\nThis officer was a cold, taciturn man, inspiring little love in those directly beneath him, yet respected and feared by the black soldiers of his little command.\n\nWerper was accustomed to sit for hours glaring at his superior as the two sat upon the veranda of their common quarters, smoking their evening cigarets in a silence which neither seemed desirous of breaking. The senseless hatred of the lieutenant grew at last into a form of mania. The captain\u2019s natural taciturnity he distorted into a studied attempt to insult him because of his past shortcomings. He imagined that his superior held him in contempt, and so he chafed and fumed inwardly until one evening his madness became suddenly homicidal. He fingered the butt of the revolver at his hip, his eyes narrowed and his brows contracted. At last he spoke.\n\n\u201cYou have insulted me for the last time!\u201d he cried, springing to his feet. \u201cI am an officer and a gentleman, and I shall put up with it no longer without an accounting from you, you pig.\u201d\n\nThe captain, an expression of surprise upon his features, turned toward his junior. He had seen men before with the jungle madness upon them\u2014the madness of solitude and unrestrained brooding, and perhaps a touch of fever.\n\nHe rose and extended his hand to lay it upon the other\u2019s shoulder. Quiet words of counsel were upon his lips; but they were never spoken. Werper construed his superior\u2019s action into an attempt to close with him. His revolver was on a level with the captain\u2019s heart, and the latter had taken but a step when Werper pulled the trigger. Without a moan the man sank to the rough planking of the veranda, and as he fell the mists that had clouded Werper\u2019s brain lifted, so that he saw himself and the deed that he had done in the same light that those who must judge him would see them.\n\nHe heard excited exclamations from the quarters of the soldiers and he heard men running in his direction. They would seize him, and if they didn\u2019t kill him they would take him down the Congo to a point where a properly ordered military tribunal would do so just as effectively, though in a more regular manner.\n\nWerper had no desire to die. Never before had he so yearned for life as in this moment that he had so effectively forfeited his right to live. The men were nearing him. What was he to do? He glanced about as though searching for the tangible form of a legitimate excuse for his crime; but he could find only the body of the man he had so causelessly shot down.\n\nIn despair, he turned and fled from the oncoming soldiery. Across the compound he ran, his revolver still clutched tightly in his hand. At the gates a sentry halted him. Werper did not pause to parley or to exert the influence of his commission\u2014he merely raised his weapon and shot down the innocent black. A moment later the fugitive had torn open the gates and vanished into the blackness of the jungle, but not before he had transferred the rifle and ammunition belts of the dead sentry to his own person.\n\nAll that night Werper fled farther and farther into the heart of the wilderness. Now and again the voice of a lion brought him to a listening halt; but with cocked and ready rifle he pushed ahead again, more fearful of the human huntsmen in his rear than of the wild carnivora ahead.\n\nDawn came at last, but still the man plodded on. All sense of hunger and fatigue were lost in the terrors of contemplated capture. He could think only of escape. He dared not pause to rest or eat until there was no further danger from pursuit, and so he staggered on until at last he fell and could rise no more. How long he had fled he did not know, or try to know. When he could flee no longer the knowledge that he had reached his limit was hidden from him in the unconsciousness of utter exhaustion.\n\n\nAnd thus it was that Achmet Zek, the Arab, found him. Achmet\u2019s followers were for running a spear through the body of their hereditary enemy; but Achmet would have it otherwise. First he would question the Belgian. It were easier to question a man first and kill him afterward, than kill him first and then question him.\n\nSo he had Lieutenant Albert Werper carried to his own tent, and there slaves administered wine and food in small quantities until at last the prisoner regained consciousness. As he opened his eyes he saw the faces of strange black men about him, and just outside the tent the figure of an Arab. Nowhere was the uniform of his soldiers to be seen.\n\nThe Arab turned and seeing the open eyes of the prisoner upon him, entered the tent.\n\n\u201cI am Achmet Zek,\u201d he announced. \u201cWho are you, and what were you doing in my country? Where are your soldiers?\u201d\n\nAchmet Zek! Werper\u2019s eyes went wide, and his heart sank. He was in the clutches of the most notorious of cut-throats\u2014a hater of all Europeans, especially those who wore the uniform of Belgium. For years the military forces of Belgian Congo had waged a fruitless war upon this man and his followers\u2014a war in which quarter had never been asked nor expected by either side.\n\nBut presently in the very hatred of the man for Belgians, Werper saw a faint ray of hope for himself. He, too, was an outcast and an outlaw. So far, at least, they possessed a common interest, and Werper decided to play upon it for all that it might yield.\n\n\n\u201cI have heard of you,\u201d he replied, \u201cand was searching for you. My people have turned against me. I hate them. Even now their soldiers are searching for me, to kill me. I knew that you would protect me from them, for you, too, hate them. In return I will take service with you. I am a trained soldier. I can fight, and your enemies are my enemies.\u201d\n\nAchmet Zek eyed the European in silence. In his mind he revolved many thoughts, chief among which was that the unbeliever lied. Of course there was the chance that he did not lie, and if he told the truth then his proposition was one well worthy of consideration, since fighting men were never over plentiful\u2014especially white men with the training and knowledge of military matters that a European officer must possess.\n\nAchmet Zek scowled and Werper\u2019s heart sank; but Werper did not know Achmet Zek, who was quite apt to scowl where another would smile, and smile where another would scowl.\n\n\u201cAnd if you have lied to me,\u201d said Achmet Zek, \u201cI will kill you at any time. What return, other than your life, do you expect for your services?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy keep only, at first,\u201d replied Werper. \u201cLater, if I am worth more, we can easily reach an understanding.\u201d Werper\u2019s only desire at the moment was to preserve his life. And so the agreement was reached and Lieutenant Albert Werper became a member of the ivory and slave raiding band of the notorious Achmet Zek.",
    "Moved by these vague yet all-powerful urgings the ape-man lay awake one night in the little thorn boma that protected, in a way, his party from the depredations of the great carnivora of the jungle. A single warrior stood sleepy guard beside the fire that yellow eyes out of the darkness beyond the camp made imperative. The moans and the coughing of the big cats mingled with the myriad noises of the lesser denizens of the jungle to fan the savage flame in the breast of this savage English lord. He tossed upon his bed of grasses, sleepless, for an hour and then he rose, noiseless as a wraith, and while the Waziri\u2019s back was turned, vaulted the boma wall in the face of the flaming eyes, swung silently into a great tree and was gone.\n\nFor a time in sheer exuberance of animal spirit he raced swiftly through the middle terrace, swinging perilously across wide spans from one jungle giant to the next, and then he clambered upward to the swaying, lesser boughs of the upper terrace where the moon shone full upon him and the air was stirred by little breezes and death lurked ready in each frail branch. Here he paused and raised his face to Goro, the moon. With uplifted arm he stood, the cry of the bull ape quivering upon his lips, yet he remained silent lest he arouse his faithful Waziri who were all too familiar with the hideous challenge of their master.\n\n\nAnd then he went on more slowly and with greater stealth and caution, for now Tarzan of the Apes was seeking a kill. Down to the ground he came in the utter blackness of the close-set boles and the overhanging verdure of the jungle. He stooped from time to time and put his nose close to earth. He sought and found a wide game trail and at last his nostrils were rewarded with the scent of the fresh spoor of Bara, the deer. Tarzan\u2019s mouth watered and a low growl escaped his patrician lips. Sloughed from him was the last vestige of artificial caste\u2014once again he was the primeval hunter\u2014the first man\u2014the highest caste type of the human race. Up wind he followed the elusive spoor with a sense of perception so transcending that of ordinary man as to be inconceivable to us. Through counter currents of the heavy stench of meat eaters he traced the trail of Bara; the sweet and cloying stink of Horta, the boar, could not drown his quarry\u2019s scent\u2014the permeating, mellow musk of the deer\u2019s foot.\n\nPresently the body scent of the deer told Tarzan that his prey was close at hand. It sent him into the trees again\u2014into the lower terrace where he could watch the ground below and catch with ears and nose the first intimation of actual contact with his quarry. Nor was it long before the ape-man came upon Bara standing alert at the edge of a moon-bathed clearing. Noiselessly Tarzan crept through the trees until he was directly over the deer. In the ape-man\u2019s right hand was the long hunting knife of his father and in his heart the blood lust of the carnivore. Just for an instant he poised above the unsuspecting Bara and then he launched himself downward upon the sleek back. The impact of his weight carried the deer to its knees and before the animal could regain its feet the knife had found its heart. As Tarzan rose upon the body of his kill to scream forth his hideous victory cry into the face of the moon the wind carried to his nostrils something which froze him to statuesque immobility and silence. His savage eyes blazed into the direction from which the wind had borne down the warning to him and a moment later the grasses at one side of the clearing parted and Numa, the lion, strode majestically into view. His yellow-green eyes were fastened upon Tarzan as he halted just within the clearing and glared enviously at the successful hunter, for Numa had had no luck this night.\n\n\nFrom the lips of the ape-man broke a rumbling growl of warning. Numa answered but he did not advance. Instead he stood waving his tail gently to and fro, and presently Tarzan squatted upon his kill and cut a generous portion from a hind quarter. Numa eyed him with growing resentment and rage as, between mouthfuls, the ape-man growled out his savage warnings. Now this particular lion had never before come in contact with Tarzan of the Apes and he was much mystified. Here was the appearance and the scent of a man-thing and Numa had tasted of human flesh and learned that though not the most palatable it was certainly by far the easiest to secure, yet there was that in the bestial growls of the strange creature which reminded him of formidable antagonists and gave him pause, while his hunger and the odor of the hot flesh of Bara goaded him almost to madness. Always Tarzan watched him, guessing what was passing in the little brain of the carnivore and well it was that he did watch him, for at last Numa could stand it no longer. His tail shot suddenly erect and at the same instant the wary ape-man, knowing all too well what the signal portended, grasped the remainder of the deer\u2019s hind quarter between his teeth and leaped into a nearby tree as Numa charged him with all the speed and a sufficient semblance of the weight of an express train.\n\n\nTarzan\u2019s retreat was no indication that he felt fear. Jungle life is ordered along different lines than ours and different standards prevail. Had Tarzan been famished he would, doubtless, have stood his ground and met the lion\u2019s charge. He had done the thing before upon more than one occasion, just as in the past he had charged lions himself; but tonight he was far from famished and in the hind quarter he had carried off with him was more raw flesh than he could eat; yet it was with no equanimity that he looked down upon Numa rending the flesh of Tarzan\u2019s kill. The presumption of this strange Numa must be punished! And forthwith Tarzan set out to make life miserable for the big cat. Close by were many trees bearing large, hard fruits and to one of these the ape-man swung with the agility of a squirrel. Then commenced a bombardment which brought forth earthshaking roars from Numa. One after another as rapidly as he could gather and hurl them, Tarzan pelted the hard fruit down upon the lion. It was impossible for the tawny cat to eat under that hail of missiles\u2014he could but roar and growl and dodge and eventually he was driven away entirely from the carcass of Bara, the deer. He went roaring and resentful; but in the very center of the clearing his voice was suddenly hushed and Tarzan saw the great head lower and flatten out, the body crouch and the long tail quiver, as the beast slunk cautiously toward the trees upon the opposite side.\n\n\nImmediately Tarzan was alert. He lifted his head and sniffed the slow, jungle breeze. What was it that had attracted Numa\u2019s attention and taken him soft-footed and silent away from the scene of his discomfiture? Just as the lion disappeared among the trees beyond the clearing Tarzan caught upon the down-coming wind the explanation of his new interest\u2014the scent spoor of man was wafted strongly to the sensitive nostrils. Caching the remainder of the deer\u2019s hind quarter in the crotch of a tree the ape-man wiped his greasy palms upon his naked thighs and swung off in pursuit of Numa.",
    "From the north came Achmet Zek, riding to the summons of his lieutenant\u2019s letter. With him came his horde of renegade Arabs, outlawed marauders, these, and equally degraded blacks, garnered from the more debased and ignorant tribes of savage cannibals through whose countries the raider passed to and fro with perfect impunity.\n\nMugambi, the ebon Hercules, who had shared the dangers and vicissitudes of his beloved Bwana, from Jungle Island, almost to the headwaters of the Ugambi, was the first to note the bold approach of the sinister caravan.\n\nHe it was whom Tarzan had left in charge of the warriors who remained to guard Lady Greystoke, nor could a braver or more loyal guardian have been found in any clime or upon any soil. A giant in stature, a savage, fearless warrior, the huge black possessed also soul and judgment in proportion to his bulk and his ferocity.\n\nNot once since his master had departed had he been beyond sight or sound of the bungalow, except when Lady Greystoke chose to canter across the broad plain, or relieve the monotony of her loneliness by a brief hunting excursion. On such occasions Mugambi, mounted upon a wiry Arab, had ridden close at her horse\u2019s heels.\n\n\nThe raiders were still a long way off when the warrior\u2019s keen eyes discovered them. For a time he stood scrutinizing the advancing party in silence, then he turned and ran rapidly in the direction of the native huts which lay a few hundred yards below the bungalow.\n\nHere he called out to the lolling warriors. He issued orders rapidly. In compliance with them the men seized upon their weapons and their shields. Some ran to call in the workers from the fields and to warn the tenders of the flocks and herds. The majority followed Mugambi back toward the bungalow.\n\nThe dust of the raiders was still a long distance away. Mugambi could not know positively that it hid an enemy; but he had spent a lifetime of savage life in savage Africa, and he had seen parties before come thus unheralded. Sometimes they had come in peace and sometimes they had come in war\u2014one could never tell. It was well to be prepared. Mugambi did not like the haste with which the strangers advanced.\n\n\nThe Greystoke bungalow was not well adapted for defense. No palisade surrounded it, for, situated as it was, in the heart of loyal Waziri, its master had anticipated no possibility of an attack in force by any enemy. Heavy, wooden shutters there were to close the window apertures against hostile arrows, and these Mugambi was engaged in lowering when Lady Greystoke appeared upon the veranda.\n\n\u201cWhy, Mugambi!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhat has happened? Why are you lowering the shutters?\u201d\n\nMugambi pointed out across the plain to where a white-robed force of mounted men was now distinctly visible.\n\n\u201cArabs,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey come for no good purpose in the absence of the Great Bwana.\u201d\n\nBeyond the neat lawn and the flowering shrubs, Jane Clayton saw the glistening bodies of her Waziri. The sun glanced from the tips of their metal-shod spears, picked out the gorgeous colors in the feathers of their war bonnets, and reflected the high-lights from the glossy skins of their broad shoulders and high cheek bones.\n\nJane Clayton surveyed them with unmixed feelings of pride and affection. What harm could befall her with such as these to protect her?\n\n\nThe raiders had halted now, a hundred yards out upon the plain. Mugambi had hastened down to join his warriors. He advanced a few yards before them and raising his voice hailed the strangers. Achmet Zek sat straight in his saddle before his henchmen.\n\n\u201cArab!\u201d cried Mugambi. \u201cWhat do you here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe come in peace,\u201d Achmet Zek called back.\n\n\u201cThen turn and go in peace,\u201d replied Mugambi. \u201cWe do not want you here. There can be no peace between Arab and Waziri.\u201d\n\nMugambi, although not born in Waziri, had been adopted into the tribe, which now contained no member more jealous of its traditions and its prowess than he.\n\nAchmet Zek drew to one side of his horde, speaking to his men in a low voice. A moment later, without warning, a ragged volley was poured into the ranks of the Waziri. A couple of warriors fell, the others were for charging the attackers; but Mugambi was a cautious as well as a brave leader. He knew the futility of charging mounted men armed with muskets. He withdrew his force behind the shrubbery of the garden. Some he dispatched to various other parts of the grounds surrounding the bungalow. Half a dozen he sent to the bungalow itself with instructions to keep their mistress within doors, and to protect her with their lives.\n\n\nAdopting the tactics of the desert fighters from which he had sprung, Achmet Zek led his followers at a gallop in a long, thin line, describing a great circle which drew closer and closer in toward the defenders.\n\nAt that part of the circle closest to the Waziri, a constant fusillade of shots was poured into the bushes behind which the black warriors had concealed themselves. The latter, on their part, loosed their slim shafts at the nearest of the enemy.\n\nThe Waziri, justly famed for their archery, found no cause to blush for their performance that day. Time and again some swarthy horseman threw hands above his head and toppled from his saddle, pierced by a deadly arrow; but the contest was uneven. The Arabs outnumbered the Waziri; their bullets penetrated the shrubbery and found marks that the Arab riflemen had not even seen; and then Achmet Zek circled inward a half mile above the bungalow, tore down a section of the fence, and led his marauders within the grounds.\n\nAcross the fields they charged at a mad run. Not again did they pause to lower fences, instead, they drove their wild mounts straight for them, clearing the obstacles as lightly as winged gulls.\n\nMugambi saw them coming, and, calling those of his warriors who remained, ran for the bungalow and the last stand. Upon the veranda Lady Greystoke stood, rifle in hand. More than a single raider had accounted to her steady nerves and cool aim for his outlawry; more than a single pony raced, riderless, in the wake of the charging horde.\n\nMugambi pushed his mistress back into the greater security of the interior, and with his depleted force prepared to make a last stand against the foe.",
    "Basuli and his warriors had noted the devastation the moment they had come in sight of the farm. Now they hastened on toward it talking excitedly among themselves in animated speculation upon the cause and meaning of the catastrophe.\nWhen, at last they crossed the trampled garden and stood before the charred ruins of their master\u2019s bungalow, their greatest fears became convictions in the light of the evidence about them.\nRemnants of human dead, half devoured by prowling hyenas and others of the carnivora which infested the region, lay rotting upon the ground, and among the corpses remained sufficient remnants of their clothing and ornaments to make clear to Basuli the frightful story of the disaster that had befallen his master\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cThe Arabs,\u201d he said, as his men clustered about him.\n\nThe Waziri gazed about in mute rage for several minutes. Everywhere they encountered only further evidence of the ruthlessness of the cruel enemy that had come during the Great Bwana\u2019s absence and laid waste his property.\n\n\u201cWhat did they with \u2018Lady\u2019?\u201d asked one of the blacks.\n\nThey had always called Lady Greystoke thus.\n\n\u201cThe women they would have taken with them,\u201d said Basuli. \u201cOur women and his.\u201d\n\nA giant black raised his spear above his head, and gave voice to a savage cry of rage and hate. The others followed his example. Basuli silenced them with a gesture.\n\n\u201cThis is no time for useless noises of the mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Great Bwana has taught us that it is acts by which things are done, not words. Let us save our breath\u2014we shall need it all to follow up the Arabs and slay them. If \u2018Lady\u2019 and our women live the greater the need of haste, and warriors cannot travel fast upon empty lungs.\u201d\n\nFrom the shelter of the reeds along the river, Werper and Tarzan watched the blacks. They saw them dig a trench with their knives and fingers. They saw them lay their yellow burdens in it and scoop the overturned earth back over the tops of the ingots.\nTarzan seemed little interested, after Werper had assured him that that which they buried was not good to eat; but Werper was intensely interested. He would have given much had he had his own followers with him, that he might take away the treasure as soon as the blacks left, for he was sure that they would leave this scene of desolation and death as soon as possible.\n\nThe treasure buried, the blacks removed themselves a short distance up wind from the fetid corpses, where they made camp, that they might rest before setting out in pursuit of the Arabs. It was already dusk. Werper and Tarzan sat devouring some pieces of meat they had brought from their last camp. The Belgian was occupied with his plans for the immediate future. He was positive that the Waziri would pursue Achmet Zek, for he knew enough of savage warfare, and of the characteristics of the Arabs and their degraded followers to guess that they had carried the Waziri women off into slavery. This alone would assure immediate pursuit by so warlike a people as the Waziri.\n\nWerper felt that he should find the means and the opportunity to push on ahead, that he might warn Achmet Zek of the coming of Basuli, and also of the location of the buried treasure. What the Arab would now do with Lady Greystoke, in view of the mental affliction of her husband, Werper neither knew nor cared. It was enough that the golden treasure buried upon the site of the burned bungalow was infinitely more valuable than any ransom that would have occurred even to the avaricious mind of the Arab, and if Werper could persuade the raider to share even a portion of it with him he would be well satisfied.\n\nBut by far the most important consideration, to Werper, at least, was the incalculably valuable treasure in the little leathern pouch at Tarzan\u2019s side. If he could but obtain possession of this! He must! He would!\n\nHis eyes wandered to the object of his greed. They measured Tarzan\u2019s giant frame, and rested upon the rounded muscles of his arms. It was hopeless. What could he, Werper, hope to accomplish, other than his own death, by an attempt to wrest the gems from their savage owner?\n\nDisconsolate, Werper threw himself upon his side. His head was pillowed on one arm, the other rested across his face in such a way that his eyes were hidden from the ape-man, though one of them was fastened upon him from beneath the shadow of the Belgian\u2019s forearm. For a time he lay thus, glowering at Tarzan, and originating schemes for plundering him of his treasure\u2014schemes that were discarded as futile as rapidly as they were born.",
    "Tarzan presently let his own eyes rest upon Werper. The Belgian saw that he was being watched, and lay very still. After a few moments he simulated the regular breathing of deep slumber.\nTarzan had been thinking. He had seen the Waziri bury their belongings. Werper had told him that they were hiding them lest some one find them and take them away. This seemed to Tarzan a splendid plan for safeguarding valuables. Since Werper had evinced a desire to possess his glittering pebbles, Tarzan, with the suspicions of a savage, had guarded the baubles, of whose worth he was entirely ignorant, as zealously as though they spelled life or death to him.\n\nFor a long time the ape-man sat watching his companion. At last, convinced that he slept, Tarzan withdrew his hunting knife and commenced to dig a hole in the ground before him. With the blade he loosened up the earth, and with his hands he scooped it out until he had excavated a little cavity a few inches in diameter, and five or six inches in depth. Into this he placed the pouch of jewels. Werper almost forgot to breathe after the fashion of a sleeper as he saw what the ape-man was doing\u2014he scarce repressed an ejaculation of satisfaction.\n\nTarzan become suddenly rigid as his keen ears noted the cessation of the regular inspirations and expirations of his companion. His narrowed eyes bored straight down upon the Belgian. Werper felt that he was lost\u2014he must risk all on his ability to carry on the deception. He sighed, threw both arms outward, and turned over on his back mumbling as though in the throes of a bad dream. A moment later he resumed the regular breathing.\n\nNow he could not watch Tarzan, but he was sure that the man sat for a long time looking at him. Then, faintly, Werper heard the other\u2019s hands scraping dirt, and later patting it down. He knew then that the jewels were buried.\n\nIt was an hour before Werper moved again, then he rolled over facing Tarzan and opened his eyes. The ape-man slept. By reaching out his hand Werper could touch the spot where the pouch was buried.\n\nFor a long time he lay watching and listening. He moved about, making more noise than necessary, yet Tarzan did not awaken. He drew the sacrificial knife from his belt, and plunged it into the ground. Tarzan did not move. Cautiously the Belgian pushed the blade downward through the loose earth above the pouch. He felt the point touch the soft, tough fabric of the leather. Then he pried down upon the handle. Slowly the little mound of loose earth rose and parted. An instant later a corner of the pouch came into view. Werper pulled it from its hiding place, and tucked it in his shirt. Then he refilled the hole and pressed the dirt carefully down as it had been before.\n\nGreed had prompted him to an act, the discovery of which by his companion could lead only to the most frightful consequences for Werper. Already he could almost feel those strong, white fangs burying themselves in his neck. He shuddered. Far out across the plain a leopard screamed, and in the dense reeds behind him some great beast moved on padded feet.\n\nWerper feared these prowlers of the night; but infinitely more he feared the just wrath of the human beast sleeping at his side. With utmost caution the Belgian arose. Tarzan did not move. Werper took a few steps toward the plain and the distant forest to the northwest, then he paused and fingered the hilt of the long knife in his belt. He turned and looked down upon the sleeper.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he mused. \u201cThen I should be safe.\u201d\n\nHe returned and bent above the ape-man. Clutched tightly in his hand was the sacrificial knife of the High Priestess of the Flaming God!",
    "La had followed her company and when she saw them clawing and biting at Tarzan, she raised her voice and cautioned them not to kill him. She saw that he was weakening and that soon the greater numbers would prevail over him, nor had she long to wait before the mighty jungle creature lay helpless and bound at her feet.\n\n\u201cBring him to the place at which we stopped,\u201d she commanded and they carried Tarzan back to the little clearing and threw him down beneath a tree.\n\n\u201cBuild me a shelter!\u201d ordered La. \u201cWe shall stop here tonight and tomorrow in the face of the Flaming God, La will offer up the heart of this defiler of the temple. Where is the sacred knife? Who took it from him?\u201d\n\nBut no one had seen it and each was positive in his assurance that the sacrificial weapon had not been upon Tarzan\u2019s person when they captured him. The ape-man looked upon the menacing creatures which surrounded him and snarled his defiance. He looked upon La and smiled. In the face of death he was unafraid.\n\n\u201cWhere is the knife?\u201d La asked him.\n\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d replied Tarzan. \u201cThe man took it with him when he slipped away during the night. Since you are so desirous for its return I would look for him and get it back for you, did you not hold me prisoner; but now that I am to die I cannot get it back. Of what good was your knife, anyway? You can make another. Did you follow us all this way for nothing more than a knife? Let me go and find him and I will bring it back to you.\u201d\n\nLa laughed a bitter laugh, for in her heart she knew that Tarzan\u2019s sin was greater than the purloining of the sacrificial knife of Opar; yet as she looked at him lying bound and helpless before her, tears rose to her eyes so that she had to turn away to hide them; but she remained inflexible in her determination to make him pay in frightful suffering and in eventual death for daring to spurn the love of La.\n\nWhen the shelter was completed La had Tarzan transferred to it. \u201cAll night I shall torture him,\u201d she muttered to her priests, \u201cand at the first streak of dawn you may prepare the flaming altar upon which his heart shall be offered up to the Flaming God. Gather wood well filled with pitch, lay it in the form and size of the altar at Opar in the center of the clearing that the Flaming God may look down upon our handiwork and be pleased.\u201d\n\nDuring the balance of the day the priests of Opar were busy erecting an altar in the center of the clearing, and while they worked they chanted weird hymns in the ancient tongue of that lost continent that lies at the bottom of the Atlantic. They knew not the meanings of the words they mouthed; they but repeated the ritual that had been handed down from preceptor to neophyte since that long-gone day when the ancestors of the Piltdown man still swung by their tails in the humid jungles that are England now.\n\nAnd in the shelter of the hut, La paced to and fro beside the stoic ape-man. Resigned to his fate was Tarzan. No hope of succor gleamed through the dead black of the death sentence hanging over him. He knew that his giant muscles could not part the many strands that bound his wrists and ankles, for he had strained often, but ineffectually for release. He had no hope of outside help and only enemies surrounded him within the camp, and yet he smiled at La as she paced nervously back and forth the length of the shelter.\n\nAnd La? She fingered her knife and looked down upon her captive. She glared and muttered but she did not strike. \u201cTonight!\u201d she thought. \u201cTonight, when it is dark I will torture him.\u201d She looked upon his perfect, godlike figure and upon his handsome, smiling face and then she steeled her heart again by thoughts of her love spurned; by religious thoughts that damned the infidel who had desecrated the holy of holies; who had taken from the blood-stained altar of Opar the offering to the Flaming God\u2014and not once but thrice. Three times had Tarzan cheated the god of her fathers. At the thought La paused and knelt at his side. In her hand was a sharp knife. She placed its point against the ape-man\u2019s side and pressed upon the hilt; but Tarzan only smiled and shrugged his shoulders.",
    "Achmet Zek with two of his followers had circled far to the south to intercept the flight of his deserting lieutenant, Werper. Others had spread out in various directions, so that a vast circle had been formed by them during the night, and now they were beating in toward the center. Achmet and the two with him halted for a short rest just before noon. They squatted beneath the trees upon the southern edge of a clearing. The chief of the raiders was in ill humor. To have been outwitted by an unbeliever was bad enough; but to have, at the same time, lost the jewels upon which he had set his avaricious heart was altogether too much\u2014Allah must, indeed be angry with his servant. Well, he still had the woman. She would bring a fair price in the north, and there was, too, the buried treasure beside the ruins of the Englishman\u2019s house.\n\nA slight noise in the jungle upon the opposite side of the clearing brought Achmet Zek to immediate and alert attention. He gathered his rifle in readiness for instant use, at the same time motioning his followers to silence and concealment. Crouching behind the bushes the three waited, their eyes fastened upon the far side of the open space.\n\nPresently the foliage parted and a woman\u2019s face appeared, glancing fearfully from side to side. A moment later, evidently satisfied that no immediate danger lurked before her, she stepped out into the clearing in full view of the Arab. Achmet Zek caught his breath with a muttered exclamation of incredulity and an imprecation. The woman was the prisoner he had thought safely guarded at his camp! Apparently she was alone, but Achmet Zek waited that he might make sure of it before seizing her. Slowly Jane Clayton started across the clearing. Twice already since she had quitted the village of the raiders had she barely escaped the fangs of carnivora, and once she had almost stumbled into the path of one of the searchers. Though she was almost despairing of ever reaching safety she still was determined to fight on, until death or success terminated her endeavors.\n\nAs the Arabs watched her from the safety of their concealment, and Achmet Zek noted with satisfaction that she was walking directly into his clutches, another pair of eyes looked down upon the entire scene from the foliage of an adjacent tree. Puzzled, troubled eyes they were, for all their gray and savage glint, for their owner was struggling with an intangible suggestion of the familiarity of the face and figure of the woman below him.\n\nA sudden crashing of the bushes at the point from which Jane Clayton had emerged into the clearing brought her to a sudden stop and attracted the attention of the Arabs and the watcher in the tree to the same point. The woman wheeled about to see what new danger menaced her from behind, and as she did so a great, anthropoid ape waddled into view. Behind him came another and another; but Lady Greystoke did not wait to learn how many more of the hideous creatures were so close upon her trail.\n\nWith a smothered scream she rushed toward the opposite jungle, and as she reached the bushes there, Achmet Zek and his two henchmen rose up and seized her. At the same instant a naked, brown giant dropped from the branches of a tree at the right of the clearing. Turning toward the astonished apes he gave voice to a short volley of low gutturals, and without waiting to note the effect of his words upon them, wheeled and charged for the Arabs.\n\nAchmet Zek was dragging Jane Clayton toward his tethered horse. His two men were hastily unfastening all three mounts. The woman, struggling to escape the Arab, turned and saw the ape-man running toward her. A glad light of hope illuminated her face. \u201cJohn!\u201d she cried. \u201cThank God that you have come in time.\u201d\n\nBehind Tarzan came the great apes, wondering, but obedient to his summons. The Arabs saw that they would not have time to mount and make their escape before the beasts and the man were upon them. Achmet Zek recognized the latter as the redoubtable enemy of such as he, and he saw, too, in the circumstance an opportunity to rid himself forever of the menace of the ape-man\u2019s presence. Calling to his men to follow his example he raised his rifle and leveled it upon the charging giant. His followers, acting with no less alacrity than himself, fired almost simultaneously, and with the reports of the rifles, Tarzan of the Apes and two of his hairy henchmen pitched forward among the jungle grasses.\n\nThe noise of the rifle shots brought the balance of the apes to a wondering pause, and, taking advantage of their momentary distraction, Achmet Zek and his fellows leaped to their horses\u2019 backs and galloped away with the now hopeless and grief-stricken woman. Back to the village they rode, and once again Lady Greystoke found herself incarcerated in the filthy, little hut from which she had thought to have escaped for good. But this time she was not only guarded by an additional sentry, but bound as well.\n\nSingly and in twos the searchers who had ridden out with Achmet Zek upon the trail of the Belgian, returned empty handed. With the report of each the raider\u2019s rage and chagrin increased, until he was in such a transport of ferocious anger that none dared approach him. Threatening and cursing, Achmet Zek paced up and down the floor of his silken tent; but his temper served him naught\u2014Werper was gone and with him the fortune in scintillating gems which had aroused the cupidity of his chief and placed the sentence of death upon the head of the lieutenant.",
    "As the pursued and the pursuer raced madly toward the distant forest the battle behind them raged with bloody savageness. No quarter was asked or given by either the ferocious Abyssinians or the murderous cut-throats of Achmet Zek.\n\nFrom the concealment of the shrubbery Tarzan watched the sanguinary conflict which so effectually surrounded him that he found no loop-hole through which he might escape to follow Werper and the Arab chief. The Abyssinians were formed in a circle which included Tarzan\u2019s position, and around and into them galloped the yelling raiders, now darting away, now charging in to deliver thrusts and cuts with their curved swords.\n\nNumerically the men of Achmet Zek were superior, and slowly but surely the soldiers of Menelek were being exterminated. To Tarzan the result was immaterial. He watched with but a single purpose\u2014to escape the ring of blood-mad fighters and be away after the Belgian and his pouch.\n\nWhen he had first discovered Werper upon the trail where he had slain Bara, he had thought that his eyes must be playing him false, so certain had he been that the thief had been slain and devoured by Numa; but after following the detachment for two days, with his keen eyes always upon the Belgian, he no longer doubted the identity of the man, though he was put to it to explain the identity of the mutilated corpse he had supposed was the man he sought.\n\nAs he crouched in hiding among the unkempt shrubbery which so short a while since had been the delight and pride of the wife he no longer recalled, an Arab and an Abyssinian wheeled their mounts close to his position as they slashed at each other with their swords. Step by step the Arab beat back his adversary until the latter\u2019s horse all but trod upon the ape-man, and then a vicious cut clove the black warrior\u2019s skull, and the corpse toppled backward almost upon Tarzan.\n\nAs the Abyssinian tumbled from his saddle the possibility of escape which was represented by the riderless horse electrified the ape-man to instant action. Before the frightened beast could gather himself for flight a naked giant was astride his back. A strong hand had grasped his bridle rein, and the surprised Arab discovered a new foe in the saddle of him, whom he had slain.\n\nBut this enemy wielded no sword, and his spear and bow remained upon his back. The Arab, recovered from his first surprise, dashed in with raised sword to annihilate this presumptuous stranger. He aimed a mighty blow at the ape-man\u2019s head, a blow which swung harmlessly through thin air as Tarzan ducked from its path, and then the Arab felt the other\u2019s horse brushing his leg, a great arm shot out and encircled his waist, and before he could recover himself he was dragged from his saddle, and forming a shield for his antagonist was borne at a mad run straight through the encircling ranks of his fellows.\n\nJust beyond them he was tossed aside upon the ground, and the last he saw of his strange foeman the latter was galloping off across the plain in the direction of the forest at its farther edge.\n\nFor another hour the battle raged nor did it cease until the last of the Abyssinians lay dead upon the ground, or had galloped off toward the north in flight. But a handful of men escaped, among them Abdul Mourak.\n\nThe victorious raiders collected about the pile of golden ingots which the Abyssinians had uncovered, and there awaited the return of their leader. Their exultation was slightly tempered by the glimpse they had had of the strange apparition of the naked white man galloping away upon the horse of one of their foemen and carrying a companion who was now among them expatiating upon the superhuman strength of the ape-man. None of them there but was familiar with the name and fame of Tarzan of the Apes, and the fact that they had recognized the white giant as the ferocious enemy of the wrongdoers of the jungle, added to their terror, for they had been assured that Tarzan was dead.\n\nNaturally superstitious, they fully believed that they had seen the disembodied spirit of the dead man, and now they cast fearful glances about them in expectation of the ghost\u2019s early return to the scene of the ruin they had inflicted upon him during their recent raid upon his home, and discussed in affrighted whispers the probable nature of the vengeance which the spirit would inflict upon them should he return to find them in possession of his gold.",
    "As Taglat struggled with the bonds which secured the ankles and wrists of his captive, the great lion that eyed the two from behind a nearby clump of bushes wormed closer to his intended prey. The ape\u2019s back was toward the lion. He did not see the broad head, fringed by its rough mane, protruding through the leafy wall. He could not know that the powerful hind paws were gathering close beneath the tawny belly preparatory to a sudden spring, and his first intimation of impending danger was the thunderous and triumphant roar which the charging lion could no longer suppress.\n\nScarce pausing for a backward glance, Taglat abandoned the unconscious woman and fled in the opposite direction from the horrid sound which had broken in so unexpected and terrifying a manner upon his startled ears; but the warning had come too late to save him, and the lion, in his second bound, alighted full upon the broad shoulders of the anthropoid.\n\nAs the great bull went down there was awakened in him to the full all the cunning, all the ferocity, all the physical prowess which obey the mightiest of the fundamental laws of nature, the law of self-preservation, and turning upon his back he closed with the carnivore in a death struggle so fearless and abandoned, that for a moment the great Numa himself may have trembled for the outcome.\n\nSeizing the lion by the mane, Taglat buried his yellowed fangs deep in the monster\u2019s throat, growling hideously through the muffled gag of blood and hair. Mixed with the ape\u2019s voice the lion\u2019s roars of rage and pain reverberated through the jungle, till the lesser creatures of the wild, startled from their peaceful pursuits, scurried fearfully away.\n\nRolling over and over upon the turf the two battled with demoniac fury, until the colossal cat, by doubling his hind paws far up beneath his belly sank his talons deep into Taglat\u2019s chest, then, ripping downward with all his strength, Numa accomplished his design, and the disemboweled anthropoid, with a last spasmodic struggle, relaxed in limp and bloody dissolution beneath his titanic adversary.\n\nScrambling to his feet, Numa looked about quickly in all directions, as though seeking to detect the possible presence of other foes; but only the still and unconscious form of the girl, lying a few paces from him met his gaze, and with an angry growl he placed a forepaw upon the body of his kill and raising his head gave voice to his savage victory cry.\n\nFor another moment he stood with fierce eyes roving to and fro about the clearing. At last they halted for a second time upon the girl. A low growl rumbled from the lion\u2019s throat. His lower jaw rose and fell, and the slaver drooled and dripped upon the dead face of Taglat.\n\nLike two yellow-green augurs, wide and unblinking, the terrible eyes remained fixed upon Jane Clayton. The erect and majestic pose of the great frame shrank suddenly into a sinister crouch as, slowly and gently as one who treads on eggs, the devil-faced cat crept forward toward the girl.\n\nBeneficent Fate maintained her in happy unconsciousness of the dread presence sneaking stealthily upon her. She did not know when the lion paused at her side. She did not hear the sniffing of his nostrils as he smelled about her. She did not feel the heat of the fetid breath upon her face, nor the dripping of the saliva from the frightful jaws half opened so close above her.\n\nFinally the lion lifted a forepaw and turned the body of the girl half over, then he stood again eyeing her as though still undetermined whether life was extinct or not. Some noise or odor from the nearby jungle attracted his attention for a moment. His eyes did not again return to Jane Clayton, and presently he left her, walked over to the remains of Taglat, and crouching down upon his kill with his back toward the girl, proceeded to devour the ape.\n\nIt was upon this scene that Jane Clayton at last opened her eyes. Inured to danger, she maintained her self-possession in the face of the startling surprise which her new-found consciousness revealed to her. She neither cried out nor moved a muscle, until she had taken in every detail of the scene which lay within the range of her vision.\n\nShe saw that the lion had killed the ape, and that he was devouring his prey less than fifty feet from where she lay; but what could she do? Her hands and feet were bound. She must wait then, in what patience she could command, until Numa had eaten and digested the ape, when, without doubt, he would return to feast upon her, unless, in the meantime, the dread hyenas should discover her, or some other of the numerous prowling carnivora of the jungle.",
    "The evil eyes narrowed, a vicious, thin-lipped smile tortured the villainous face, as Mohammed Beyd grinned knowingly into the face of the Belgian. Werper was both relieved and disturbed by the Arab\u2019s attitude. The complacency with which he accepted the death of his chief lifted a considerable burden of apprehension from the shoulders of Achmet Zek\u2019s assassin; but his demand for a share of the jewels boded ill for Werper when Mohammed Beyd should have learned that the precious stones were no longer in the Belgian\u2019s possession. To acknowledge that he had lost the jewels might be to arouse the wrath or suspicion of the Arab to such an extent as would jeopardize his new-found chances of escape. His one hope seemed, then, to lie in fostering Mohammed Beyd\u2019s belief that the jewels were still in his possession, and depend upon the accidents of the future to open an avenue of escape. Could he contrive to tent with the Arab upon the march north, he might find opportunity in plenty to remove this menace to his life and liberty\u2014it was worth trying, and, further, there seemed no other way out of his difficulty.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cAchmet Zek is dead. He fell in battle with a company of Abyssinian cavalry that held me captive. During the fighting I escaped; but I doubt if any of Achmet Zek\u2019s men live, and the gold they sought is in the possession of the Abyssinians. Even now they are doubtless marching on this camp, for they were sent by Menelek to punish Achmet Zek and his followers for a raid upon an Abyssinian village. There are many of them, and if we do not make haste to escape we shall all suffer the same fate as Achmet Zek.\u201d\n\nMohammed Beyd listened in silence. How much of the unbeliever\u2019s story he might safely believe he did not know; but as it afforded him an excuse for deserting the village and making for the north he was not inclined to cross-question the Belgian too minutely.\n\n\u201cAnd if I ride north with you,\u201d he asked, \u201chalf the jewels and half the ransom of the woman shall be mine?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Werper.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Mohammed Beyd. \u201cI go now to give the order for the breaking of camp early on the morrow,\u201d and he rose to leave the tent.\n\nWerper laid a detaining hand upon his arm.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said, \u201clet us determine how many shall accompany us. It is not well that we be burdened by the women and children, for then indeed we might be overtaken by the Abyssinians. It would be far better to select a small guard of your bravest men, and leave word behind that we are riding WEST. Then, when the Abyssinians come they will be put upon the wrong trail should they have it in their hearts to pursue us, and if they do not they will at least ride north with less rapidity than as though they thought that we were ahead of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe serpent is less wise than thou, Werper,\u201d said Mohammed Beyd with a smile. \u201cIt shall be done as you say. Twenty men shall accompany us, and we shall ride _west_\u2014when we leave the village.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d cried the Belgian, and so it was arranged.\n\n\nEarly the next morning Jane Clayton, after an almost sleepless night, was aroused by the sound of voices outside her prison, and a moment later, M. Frecoult, and two Arabs entered. The latter unbound her ankles and lifted her to her feet. Then her wrists were loosed, she was given a handful of dry bread, and led out into the faint light of dawn. She looked questioningly at Frecoult, and at a moment that the Arab\u2019s attention was attracted in another direction the man leaned toward her and whispered that all was working out as he had planned. Thus assured, the young woman felt a renewal of the hope which the long and miserable night of bondage had almost expunged. Shortly after, she was lifted to the back of a horse, and surrounded by Arabs, was escorted through the gateway of the village and off into the jungle toward the west. Half an hour later the party turned north, and northerly was their direction for the balance of the march.\n\nM. Frecoult spoke with her but seldom, and she understood that in carrying out his deception he must maintain the semblance of her captor, rather than protector, and so she suspected nothing though she saw the friendly relations which seemed to exist between the European and the Arab leader of the band. If Werper succeeded in keeping himself from conversation with the young woman, he failed signally to expel her from his thoughts. A hundred times a day he found his eyes wandering in her direction and feasting themselves upon her charms of face and figure. Each hour his infatuation for her grew, until his desire to possess her gained almost the proportions of madness. If either the girl or Mohammed Beyd could have guessed what passed in the mind of the man which each thought a friend and ally, the apparent harmony of the little company would have been rudely disturbed. Werper had not succeeded in arranging to tent with Mohammed Beyd, and so he revolved many plans for the assassination of the Arab that would have been greatly simplified had he been permitted to share the other\u2019s nightly shelter.\n\n\nUpon the second day out Mohammed Beyd reined his horse to the side of the animal on which the captive was mounted. It was, apparently, the first notice which the Arab had taken of the girl; but many times during these two days had his cunning eyes peered greedily from beneath the hood of his burnoose to gloat upon the beauties of the prisoner. Nor was this hidden infatuation of any recent origin. He had conceived it when first the wife of the Englishman had fallen into the hands of Achmet Zek; but while that austere chieftain lived, Mohammed Beyd had not even dared hope for a realization of his imaginings. Now, though, it was different\u2014only a despised dog of a Christian stood between himself and possession of the girl. How easy it would be to slay the unbeliever, and take unto himself both the woman and the jewels! With the latter in his possession, the ransom which might be obtained for the captive would form no great inducement to her relinquishment in the face of the pleasures of sole ownership of her. Yes, he would kill Werper, retain all the jewels and keep the Englishwoman. He turned his eyes upon her as she rode along at his side. How beautiful she was! His fingers opened and closed\u2014skinny, brown talons itching to feel the soft flesh of the victim in their remorseless clutch.",
    "Sleepless upon his blankets, Albert Werper let his evil mind dwell upon the charms of the woman in the nearby tent. He had noted Mohammed Beyd\u2019s sudden interest in the girl, and judging the man by his own standards, had guessed at the basis of the Arab\u2019s sudden change of attitude toward the prisoner. And as he let his imaginings run riot they aroused within him a bestial jealousy of Mohammed Beyd, and a great fear that the other might encompass his base designs upon the defenseless girl. By a strange process of reasoning, Werper, whose designs were identical with the Arab\u2019s, pictured himself as Jane Clayton\u2019s protector, and presently convinced himself that the attentions which might seem hideous to her if proffered by Mohammed Beyd, would be welcomed from Albert Werper. Her husband was dead, and Werper fancied that he could replace in the girl\u2019s heart the position which had been vacated by the act of the grim reaper. He could offer Jane Clayton marriage\u2014a thing which Mohammed Beyd would not offer, and which the girl would spurn from him with as deep disgust as she would his unholy lust.\n\nIt was not long before the Belgian had succeeded in convincing himself that the captive not only had every reason for having conceived sentiments of love for him; but that she had by various feminine methods acknowledged her new-born affection. And then a sudden resolution possessed him. He threw the blankets from him and rose to his feet. Pulling on his boots and buckling his cartridge belt and revolver about his hips he stepped to the flap of his tent and looked out. There was no sentry before the entrance to the prisoner\u2019s tent! What could it mean? Fate was indeed playing into his hands.\n\nStepping outside he passed to the rear of the girl\u2019s tent. There was no sentry there, either! And now, boldly, he walked to the entrance and stepped within.\n\nDimly the moonlight illumined the interior. Across the tent a figure bent above the blankets of a bed. There was a whispered word, and another figure rose from the blankets to a sitting position. Slowly Albert Werper\u2019s eyes were becoming accustomed to the half darkness of the tent. He saw that the figure leaning over the bed was that of a man, and he guessed at the truth of the nocturnal visitor\u2019s identity.\n\nA sullen, jealous rage enveloped him. He took a step in the direction of the two. He heard a frightened cry break from the girl\u2019s lips as she recognized the features of the man above her, and he saw Mohammed Beyd seize her by the throat and bear her back upon the blankets.\n\nCheated passion cast a red blur before the eyes of the Belgian. No! The man should not have her. She was for him and him alone. He would not be robbed of his rights.\n\nQuickly he ran across the tent and threw himself upon the back of Mohammed Beyd. The latter, though surprised by this sudden and unexpected attack, was not one to give up without a battle. The Belgian\u2019s fingers were feeling for his throat, but the Arab tore them away, and rising wheeled upon his adversary. As they faced each other Werper struck the Arab a heavy blow in the face, sending him staggering backward. If he had followed up his advantage he would have had Mohammed Beyd at his mercy in another moment; but instead he tugged at his revolver to draw it from its holster, and Fate ordained that at that particular moment the weapon should stick in its leather scabbard.\n\nBefore he could disengage it, Mohammed Beyd had recovered himself and was dashing upon him. Again Werper struck the other in the face, and the Arab returned the blow. Striking at each other and ceaselessly attempting to clinch, the two battled about the small interior of the tent, while the girl, wide-eyed in terror and astonishment, watched the duel in frozen silence.\n\nAgain and again Werper struggled to draw his weapon. Mohammed Beyd, anticipating no such opposition to his base desires, had come to the tent unarmed, except for a long knife which he now drew as he stood panting during the first brief rest of the encounter.\n\n\u201cDog of a Christian,\u201d he whispered, \u201clook upon this knife in the hands of Mohammed Beyd! Look well, unbeliever, for it is the last thing in life that you shall see or feel. With it Mohammed Beyd will cut out your black heart. If you have a God pray to him now\u2014in a minute more you shall be dead,\u201d and with that he rushed viciously upon the Belgian, his knife raised high above his head.\n\nWerper was still dragging futilely at his weapon. The Arab was almost upon him. In desperation the European waited until Mohammed Beyd was all but against him, then he threw himself to one side to the floor of the tent, leaving a leg extended in the path of the Arab.\n\nThe trick succeeded. Mohammed Beyd, carried on by the momentum of his charge, stumbled over the projecting obstacle and crashed to the ground. Instantly he was up again and wheeling to renew the battle; but Werper was on foot ahead of him, and now his revolver, loosened from its holster, flashed in his hand.\n\nThe Arab dove headfirst to grapple with him, there was a sharp report, a lurid gleam of flame in the darkness, and Mohammed Beyd rolled over and over upon the floor to come to a final rest beside the bed of the woman he had sought to dishonor.\n\nAlmost immediately following the report came the sound of excited voices in the camp without. Men were calling back and forth to one another asking the meaning of the shot. Werper could hear them running hither and thither, investigating.",
    "With the charge of the first lion, Jane Clayton had scrambled to her feet, and now she stood horror-struck at the scene of savage slaughter that swirled and eddied about her. Once a bolting horse knocked her down, and a moment later a lion, leaping in pursuit of another terror-stricken animal, brushed her so closely that she was again thrown from her feet.\n\nAmidst the cracking of the rifles and the growls of the carnivora rose the death screams of stricken men and horses as they were dragged down by the blood-mad cats. The leaping carnivora and the plunging horses, prevented any concerted action by the Abyssinians\u2014it was every man for himself\u2014and in the melee, the defenseless woman was either forgotten or ignored by her black captors. A score of times was her life menaced by charging lions, by plunging horses, or by the wildly fired bullets of the frightened troopers, yet there was no chance of escape, for now with the fiendish cunning of their kind, the tawny hunters commenced to circle about their prey, hemming them within a ring of mighty, yellow fangs, and sharp, long talons. Again and again an individual lion would dash suddenly among the frightened men and horses, and occasionally a horse, goaded to frenzy by pain or terror, succeeded in racing safely through the circling lions, leaping the boma, and escaping into the jungle; but for the men and the woman no such escape was possible.\n\nA horse, struck by a stray bullet, fell beside Jane Clayton, a lion leaped across the expiring beast full upon the breast of a black trooper just beyond. The man clubbed his rifle and struck futilely at the broad head, and then he was down and the carnivore was standing above him.\n\nShrieking out his terror, the soldier clawed with puny fingers at the shaggy breast in vain endeavor to push away the grinning jaws. The lion lowered his head, the gaping fangs closed with a single sickening crunch upon the fear-distorted face, and turning strode back across the body of the dead horse dragging his limp and bloody burden with him.\n\nWide-eyed the girl stood watching. She saw the carnivore step upon the corpse, stumblingly, as the grisly thing swung between its forepaws, and her eyes remained fixed in fascination while the beast passed within a few paces of her.\n\nThe interference of the body seemed to enrage the lion. He shook the inanimate clay venomously. He growled and roared hideously at the dead, insensate thing, and then he dropped it and raised his head to look about in search of some living victim upon which to wreak his ill temper. His yellow eyes fastened themselves balefully upon the figure of the girl, the bristling lips raised, disclosing the grinning fangs. A terrific roar broke from the savage throat, and the great beast crouched to spring upon this new and helpless victim.\n\nQuiet had fallen early upon the camp where Tarzan and Werper lay securely bound. Two nervous sentries paced their beats, their eyes rolling often toward the impenetrable shadows of the gloomy jungle. The others slept or tried to sleep\u2014all but the ape-man. Silently and powerfully he strained at the bonds which fettered his wrists.\n\nThe muscles knotted beneath the smooth, brown skin of his arms and shoulders, the veins stood out upon his temples from the force of his exertions\u2014a strand parted, another and another, and one hand was free. Then from the jungle came a low guttural, and the ape-man became suddenly a silent, rigid statue, with ears and nostrils straining to span the black void where his eyesight could not reach.\n\nAgain came the uncanny sound from the thick verdure beyond the camp. A sentry halted abruptly, straining his eyes into the gloom. The kinky wool upon his head stiffened and raised. He called to his comrade in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\u201cDid you hear it?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe other came closer, trembling.\n\n\u201cHear what?\u201d\n\nAgain was the weird sound repeated, followed almost immediately by a similar and answering sound from the camp. The sentries drew close together, watching the black spot from which the voice seemed to come.\n\nTrees overhung the boma at this point which was upon the opposite side of the camp from them. They dared not approach. Their terror even prevented them from arousing their fellows\u2014they could only stand in frozen fear and watch for the fearsome apparition they momentarily expected to see leap from the jungle."

  "John Buchan -- Mr. Standfast": [
    "I spent one-third of my journey looking out of the window of a first-class carriage, the next in a local motor-car following the course of a trout stream in a shallow valley, and the last tramping over a ridge of downland through great beech-woods to my quarters for the night. In the first part I was in an infamous temper; in the second I was worried and mystified; but the cool twilight of the third stage calmed and heartened me, and I reached the gates of Fosse Manor with a mighty appetite and a quiet mind.\n\nAs we slipped up the Thames valley on the smooth Great Western line I had reflected ruefully on the thorns in the path of duty. For more than a year I had never been out of khaki, except the months I spent in hospital. They gave me my battalion before the Somme, and I came out of that weary battle after the first big September fighting with a crack in my head and a D.S.O. I had received a C.B. for the Erzerum business, so what with these and my Matabele and South African medals and the Legion of Honour, I had a chest like the High Priest's breastplate. I rejoined in January, and got a brigade on the eve of Arras. There we had a star turn, and took about as many prisoners as we put infantry over the top. After that we were hauled out for a month, and subsequently planted in a bad bit on the Scarpe with a hint that we would soon be used for a big push. Then suddenly I was ordered home to report to the War Office, and passed on by them to Bullivant and his merry men. So here I was sitting in a railway carriage in a grey tweed suit, with a neat new suitcase on the rack labelled C.B. The initials stood for Cornelius Brand, for that was my name now. And an old boy in the corner was asking me questions and wondering audibly why I wasn't fighting, while a young blood of a second lieutenant with a wound stripe was eyeing me with scorn.\n\nThe old chap was one of the cross-examining type, and after he had borrowed my matches he set to work to find out all about me. He was a tremendous fire-eater, and a bit of a pessimist about our slow progress in the west. I told him I came from South Africa and was a mining engineer.\n\n'Been fighting with Botha?' he asked.\n\n'No,' I said. 'I'm not the fighting kind.'\n\nThe second lieutenant screwed up his nose.\n\n'Is there no conscription in South Africa?'\n\n'Thank God there isn't,' I said, and the old fellow begged permission to tell me a lot of unpalatable things. I knew his kind and didn't give much for it. He was the sort who, if he had been under fifty, would have crawled on his belly to his tribunal to get exempted, but being over age was able to pose as a patriot. But I didn't like the second lieutenant's grin, for he seemed a good class of lad. I looked steadily out of the window for the rest of the way, and wasn't sorry when I got to my station.\n\nI had had the queerest interview with Bullivant and Macgillivray. They asked me first if I was willing to serve again in the old game, and I said I was. I felt as bitter as sin, for I had got fixed in the military groove, and had made good there. Here was I--a brigadier and still under forty, and with another year of the war there was no saying where I might end. I had started out without any ambition, only a great wish to see the business finished. But now I had acquired a professional interest in the thing, I had a nailing good brigade, and I had got the hang of our new kind of war as well as any fellow from Sandhurst and Camberley. They were asking me to scrap all I had learned and start again in a new job. I had to agree, for discipline's discipline, but I could have knocked their heads together in my vexation.\n\nWhat was worse they wouldn't, or couldn't, tell me anything about what they wanted me for. It was the old game of running me in blinkers. They asked me to take it on trust and put myself unreservedly in their hands. I would get my instructions later, they said.\n\nI asked if it was important.\n\nBullivant narrowed his eyes. 'If it weren't, do you suppose we could have wrung an active brigadier out of the War Office? As it was, it was like drawing teeth.'\n\n'Is it risky?' was my next question.\n\n'In the long run--damnably,' was the answer.\n\n'And you can't tell me anything more?'\n\n'Nothing as yet. You'll get your instructions soon enough. You know both of us, Hannay, and you know we wouldn't waste the time of a good man on folly. We are going to ask you for something which will make a big call on your patriotism. It will be a difficult and arduous task, and it may be a very grim one before you get to the end of it, but we believe you can do it, and that no one else can ... You know us pretty well. Will you let us judge for you?'\n\nI looked at Bullivant's shrewd, kind old face and Macgillivray's steady eyes. These men were my friends and wouldn't play with Me.\n\n'All right,' I said. 'I'm willing. What's the first step?'\n\n'Get out of uniform and forget you ever were a soldier. Change your name. Your old one, Cornelis Brandt, will do, but you'd better spell it \"Brand\" this time. Remember that you are an engineer just back from South Africa, and that you don't care a rush about the war. You can't understand what all the fools are fighting about, and you think we might have peace at once by a little friendly business talk. You needn't be pro-German--if you like you can be rather severe on the Hun. But you must be in deadly earnest about a speedy peace.'\n\nI expect the corners of my mouth fell, for Bullivant burst out laughing.\n\n'Hang it all, man, it's not so difficult. I feel sometimes inclined to argue that way myself, when my dinner doesn't agree with me. It's not so hard as to wander round the Fatherland abusing Britain, which was your last job.'\n\n'I'm ready,' I said. 'But I want to do one errand on my own first. I must see a fellow in my brigade who is in a shell-shock hospital in the Cotswolds. Isham's the name of the place.'\n\nThe two men exchanged glances. 'This looks like fate,' said Bullivant. 'By all means go to Isham. The place where your work begins is only a couple of miles off. I want you to spend next Thursday night as the guest of two maiden ladies called Wymondham at Fosse Manor. You will go down there as a lone South African visiting a sick friend. They are hospitable souls and entertain many angels unawares.'\n\n'And I get my orders there?'\n\n'You get your orders, and you are under bond to obey them.' And Bullivant and Macgillivray smiled at each other.",
    "Now began a period of pleasant idle receptiveness. Once a week it was my custom to go up to London for the day to receive letters and instructions, if any should come. I had moved from my chambers in Park Lane, which I leased under my proper name, to a small flat in Westminster taken in the name of Cornelius Brand. The letters addressed to Park Lane were forwarded to Sir Walter, who sent them round under cover to my new address. For the rest I used to spend my mornings reading in the garden, and I discovered for the first time what a pleasure was to be got from old books. They recalled and amplified that vision I had seen from the Cotswold ridge, the revelation of the priceless heritage which is England. I imbibed a mighty quantity of history, but especially I liked the writers, like Walton, who got at the very heart of the English countryside. Soon, too, I found the _Pilgrim's Progress_ not a duty but a delight. I discovered new jewels daily in the honest old story, and my letters to Peter began to be as full of it as Peter's own epistles. I loved, also, the songs of the Elizabethans, for they reminded me of the girl who had sung to me in the June night.\n\nIn the afternoons I took my exercise in long tramps along the good dusty English roads. The country fell away from Biggleswick into a plain of wood and pasture-land, with low hills on the horizon. The Place was sown with villages, each with its green and pond and ancient church. Most, too, had inns, and there I had many a draught of cool nutty ale, for the inn at Biggleswick was a reformed place which sold nothing but washy cider. Often, tramping home in the dusk, I was so much in love with the land that I could have sung with the pure joy of it. And in the evening, after a bath, there would be supper, when a rather fagged Jimson struggled between sleep and hunger, and the lady, with an artistic mutch on her untidy head, talked ruthlessly of culture.\n\nBit by bit I edged my way into local society. The Jimsons were a great help, for they were popular and had a nodding acquaintance with most of the inhabitants. They regarded me as a meritorious aspirant towards a higher life, and I was paraded before their friends with the suggestion of a vivid, if Philistine, past. If I had any gift for writing, I would make a book about the inhabitants of Biggleswick. About half were respectable citizens who came there for country air and low rates, but even these had a touch of queerness and had picked up the jargon of the place. The younger men were mostly Government clerks or writers or artists. There were a few widows with flocks of daughters, and on the outskirts were several bigger houses--mostly houses which had been there before the garden city was planted. One of them was brand-new, a staring villa with sham-antique timbering, stuck on the top of a hill among raw gardens. It belonged to a man called Moxon Ivery, who was a kind of academic pacificist and a great god in the place. Another, a quiet Georgian manor house, was owned by a London publisher, an ardent Liberal whose particular branch of business compelled him to keep in touch with the new movements. I used to see him hurrying to the station swinging a little black bag and returning at night with the fish for dinner.\n\nI soon got to know a surprising lot of people, and they were the rummiest birds you can imagine. For example, there were the Weekeses, three girls who lived with their mother in a house so artistic that you broke your head whichever way you turned in it. The son of the family was a conscientious objector who had refused to do any sort of work whatever, and had got quodded for his pains. They were immensely proud of him and used to relate his sufferings in Dartmoor with a gusto which I thought rather heartless. Art was their great subject, and I am afraid they found me pretty heavy going. It was their fashion never to admire anything that was obviously beautiful, like a sunset or a pretty woman, but to find surprising loveliness in things which I thought hideous. Also they talked a language that was beyond me. This kind of conversation used to happen.--MISS WEEKES: 'Don't you admire Ursula Jimson?' SELF: 'Rather!' MISS W.: 'She is so John-esque in her lines.' SELF: 'Exactly!' MISS W.: 'And Tancred, too--he is so full of nuances.' SELF: 'Rather!' MISS W.: 'He suggests one of Degousse's countrymen.' SELF: 'Exactly!'\n\nThey hadn't much use for books, except some Russian ones, and I acquired merit in their eyes for having read Leprous Souls. If you talked to them about that divine countryside, you found they didn't give a rap for it and had never been a mile beyond the village. But they admired greatly the sombre effect of a train going into Marylebone station on a rainy day.",
    "The following day I saw her again, this time talking sedately with Mr Ivery, and dressed in a very pretty summer gown, and a broad-brimmed straw hat with flowers in it. This time she stopped with a bright smile and held out her hand. 'Mr Brand, isn't it?' she asked with a pretty hesitation. And then, turning to her companion--'This is Mr Brand. He stayed with us last month in Gloucestershire.'\n\nMr Ivery announced that he and I were already acquainted. Seen in broad daylight he was a very personable fellow, somewhere between forty-five and fifty, with a middle-aged figure and a curiously young face. I noticed that there were hardly any lines on it, and it was rather that of a very wise child than that of a man. He had a pleasant smile which made his jaw and cheeks expand like indiarubber. 'You are coming to sup with me, Mr Brand,' he cried after me. 'On Tuesday after Moot. I have already written.' He whisked Mary away from me, and I had to content myself with contemplating her figure till it disappeared round a bend of the road.\n\nNext day in London I found a letter from Peter. He had been very solemn of late, and very reminiscent of old days now that he concluded his active life was over. But this time he was in a different mood. '_I think,_' he wrote, '_that you and I will meet again soon, my old friend. Do you remember when we went after the big black-maned lion in the Rooirand and couldn't get on his track, and then one morning we woke up and said we would get him today?--and we did, but he very near got you first. I've had a feel these last days that we're both going down into the Valley to meet with Apolyon, and that the devil will give us a bad time, but anyhow we'll be together._'\n\nI had the same kind of feel myself, though I didn't see how Peter and I were going to meet, unless I went out to the Front again and got put in the bag and sent to the same Boche prison. But I had an instinct that my time in Biggleswick was drawing to a close, and that presently I would be in rougher quarters. I felt quite affectionate towards the place, and took all my favourite walks, and drank my own health in the brew of the village inns, with a consciousness of saying goodbye. Also I made haste to finish my English classics, for I concluded I wouldn't have much time in the future for miscellaneous reading.\n\nThe Tuesday came, and in the evening I set out rather late for the Moot Hall, for I had been getting into decent clothes after a long, hot stride. When I reached the place it was pretty well packed, and I could only find a seat on the back benches. There on the platform was Ivery, and beside him sat a figure that thrilled every inch of me with affection and a wild anticipation. 'I have now the privilege,' said the chairman, 'of introducing to you the speaker whom we so warmly welcome, our fearless and indefatigable American friend, Mr Blenkiron.'\n\nIt was the old Blenkiron, but almightily changed. His stoutness had gone, and he was as lean as Abraham Lincoln. Instead of a puffy face, his cheek-bones and jaw stood out hard and sharp, and in place of his former pasty colour his complexion had the clear glow of health. I saw now that he was a splendid figure of a man, and when he got to his feet every movement had the suppleness of an athlete in training. In that moment I realized that my serious business had now begun. My senses suddenly seemed quicker, my nerves tenser, my brain more active. The big game had started, and he and I were playing it together.",
    "I saw an old green felt hat, and below it lean tweed-clad shoulders. Then I saw a knapsack with a stick slung through it, as the owner wriggled his way on to a shelf. Presently he turned his face upward to judge the remaining distance. It was the face of a young man, a face sallow and angular, but now a little flushed with the day's sun and the work of climbing. It was a face that I had first seen at Fosse Manor.\n\nI felt suddenly sick and heartsore. I don't know why, but I had never really associated the intellectuals of Biggleswick with a business like this. None of them but Ivery, and he was different. They had been silly and priggish, but no more--I would have taken my oath on it. Yet here was one of them engaged in black treason against his native land. Something began to beat in my temples when I remembered that Mary and this man had been friends, that he had held her hand, and called her by her Christian name. My first impulse was to wait till he got up and then pitch him down among the boulders and let his German accomplices puzzle over his broken neck.\n\nWith difficulty I kept down that tide of fury. I had my duty to do, and to keep on terms with this man was part of it. I had to convince him that I was an accomplice, and that might not be easy. I leaned over the edge, and, as he got to his feet on the ledge above the boiler-plates, I whistled so that he turned his face to me.\n\n'Hullo, Wake,' I said.\n\nHe started, stared for a second, and recognized me. He did not seem over-pleased to see me.\n\n'Brand!' he cried. 'How did you get here?' He swung himself up beside me, straightened his back and unbuckled his knapsack. 'I thought this was my own private sanctuary, and that nobody knew it but me. Have you spotted the cave? It's the best bedroom in Skye.' His tone was, as usual, rather acid.\n\nThat little hammer was beating in my head. I longed to get my hands on his throat and choke the smug treason in him. But I kept my mind fixed on one purpose--to persuade him that I shared his secret and was on his side. His off-hand self-possession seemed only the clever screen of the surprised conspirator who was hunting for a plan.\n\nWe entered the cave, and he flung his pack into a corner. 'Last time I was here,' he said, 'I covered the floor with heather. We must get some more if we would sleep soft.' In the twilight he was a dim figure, but he seemed a new man from the one I had last seen in the Moot Hall at Biggleswick. There was a wiry vigour in his body and a purpose in his face. What a fool I had been to set him down as no more than a conceited fidneur!\n\nHe went out to the shelf again and sniffed the fresh evening. There was a wonderful red sky in the west, but in the crevice the shades had fallen, and only the bright patches at either end told of the sunset.\n\n'Wake,' I said, 'you and I have to understand each other. I'm a friend of Ivery and I know the meaning of this place. I discovered it by accident, but I want you to know that I'm heart and soul with you. You may trust me in tonight's job as if I were Ivery himself.'\n\nHe swung round and looked at me sharply. His eyes were hot again, as I remembered them at our first meeting.\n\n'What do you mean? How much do you know?'\n\nThe hammer was going hard in my forehead, and I had to pull myself together to answer.\n\n'I know that at the end of this crack a message was left last night, and that someone came out of the sea and picked it up. That someone is coming again when darkness falls, and there will be another message.'\n\nHe had turned his head away. 'You are talking nonsense. No submarine could land on this coast.'\n\nI could see that he was trying me.\n\n'This morning,' I said, 'I swam in the deep-water inlet below us. It is the most perfect submarine shelter in Britain.'\n\nHe still kept his face from me, looking the way he had come. For a moment he was silent, and then he spoke in the bitter, drawling voice which had annoyed me at Fosse Manor.\n\n'How do you reconcile this business with your principles, Mr Brand? You were always a patriot, I remember, though you didn't see eye to eye with the Government.'\n\nIt was not quite what I expected and I was unready. I stammered in my reply. 'It's because I am a patriot that I want peace. I think that ... I mean ...'\n\n'Therefore you are willing to help the enemy to win?'\n\n'They have already won. I want that recognized and the end hurried on.' I was getting my mind clearer and continued fluently.\n\n'The longer the war lasts, the worse this country is ruined. We must make the people realize the truth, and--'\n\nBut he swung round suddenly, his eyes blazing.\n\n'You blackguard!' he cried, 'you damnable blackguard!' And he flung himself on me like a wild-cat.\n\nI had got my answer. He did not believe me, he knew me for a spy, and he was determined to do me in. We were beyond finesse now, and back at the old barbaric game. It was his life or mine. The hammer beat furiously in my head as we closed, and a fierce satisfaction rose in my heart.\n\nHe never had a chance, for though he was in good trim and had the light, wiry figure of the mountaineer, he hadn't a quarter of my muscular strength. Besides, he was wrongly placed, for he had the outside station. Had he been on the inside he might have toppled me over the edge by his sudden assault. As it was, I grappled him and forced him to the ground, squeezing the breath out of his body in the process. I must have hurt him considerably, but he never gave a cry. With a good deal of trouble I lashed his hands behind his back with the belt of my waterproof, carried him inside the cave and laid him in the dark end of it. Then I tied his feet with the strap of his own knapsack. I would have to gag him, but that could wait.\n\nI had still to contrive a plan of action for the night, for I did not know what part he had been meant to play in it. He might be the messenger instead of the Portuguese Jew, in which case he would have papers about his person. If he knew of the cave, others might have the same knowledge, and I had better shift him before they came. I looked at my wrist-watch, and the luminous dial showed that the hour was half past nine.\n\nThen I noticed that the bundle in the corner was sobbing. It was a horrid sound and it worried me. I had a little pocket electric torch and I flashed it on Wake's face. If he was crying, it was with dry eyes.\n\n'What are you going to do with me?' he asked.\n\n'That depends,' I said grimly.\n\n'Well, I'm ready. I may be a poor creature, but I'm damned if I'm afraid of you, or anything like you.' That was a brave thing to say, for it was a lie; his teeth were chattering.\n\n'I'm ready for a deal,' I said.\n\n'You won't get it,' was his answer. 'Cut my throat if you mean to, but for God's sake don't insult me ... I choke when I think about you. You come to us and we welcome you, and receive you in our houses, and tell you our inmost thoughts, and all the time you're a bloody traitor. You want to sell us to Germany. You may win now, but by God! your time will come! That is my last word to you ... you swine!'",
    "The train was abominably late. It stopped at every station, and in the afternoon it simply got tired and sat down in the middle of a moor and reflected for an hour. I stuck my head out of the window now and then, and smelt the rooty fragrance of bogs, and when we halted on a bridge I watched the trout in the pools of the brown river. Then I slept and smoked alternately, and began to get furiously hungry.\n\nOnce I woke to hear the soldiers discussing the war. There was an argument between a lance-corporal in the Camerons and a sapper private about some trivial incident on the Somme.\n\n'I tell ye I was there,' said the Cameron. 'We were relievin' the Black Watch, and Fritz was shelling the road, and we didna get up to the line till one o'clock in the mornin'. Frae Frickout Circus to the south end o' the High Wood is every bit o' five mile.'\n\n'Not abune three,' said the sapper dogmatically.\n\n'Man, I've trampit it.'\n\n'Same here. I took up wire every nicht for a week.'\n\nThe Cameron looked moodily round the company. 'I wish there was anither man here that kent the place. He wad bear me out. These boys are no good, for they didna join till later. I tell ye it's five mile.'\n\n'Three,' said the sapper.\n\nTempers were rising, for each of the disputants felt his veracity assailed. It was too hot for a quarrel and I was so drowsy that I was heedless.\n\n'Shut up, you fools,' I said. 'The distance is six kilometres, so you're both wrong.'\n\nMy tone was so familiar to the men that it stopped the wrangle, but it was not the tone of a publisher's traveller. Mr Linklater cocked his ears.\n\n'What's a kilometre, Mr McCaskie?' he asked blandly.\n\n'Multiply by five and divide by eight and you get the miles.'\n\nI was on my guard now, and told a long story of a nephew who had been killed on the Somme, and how I had corresponded with the War Office about his case. 'Besides,' I said, 'I'm a great student o' the newspapers, and I've read all the books about the war. It's a difficult time this for us all, and if you can take a serious interest in the campaign it helps a lot. I mean working out the places on the map and reading Haig's dispatches.'\n\n'Just so,' he said dryly, and I thought he watched me with an odd look in his eyes.\n\nA fresh idea possessed me. This man had been in Gresson's company, he knew German, he was obviously something very different from what he professed to be. What if he were in the employ of our own Secret Service? I had appeared out of the void at the Kyle, and I had made but a poor appearance as a bagman, showing no knowledge of my own trade. I was in an area interdicted to the ordinary public; and he had good reason to keep an eye on my movements. He was going south, and so was I; clearly we must somehow part company.\n\n'We change at Muirtown, don't we?' I asked. 'When does the train for the south leave?'\n\nHe consulted a pocket timetable. 'Ten-thirty-three. There's generally four hours to wait, for we're due in at six-fifteen. But this auld hearse will be lucky if it's in by nine.'\n\nHis forecast was correct. We rumbled out of the hills into haughlands and caught a glimpse of the North Sea. Then we were hung up while a long goods train passed down the line. It was almost dark when at last we crawled into Muirtown station and disgorged our load of hot and weary soldiery.\n\nI bade an ostentatious farewell to Linklater. 'Very pleased to have met you. I'll see you later on the Edinburgh train. I'm for a walk to stretch my legs, and a bite o' supper.' I was very determined that the ten-thirty for the south should leave without me.\n\nMy notion was to get a bed and a meal in some secluded inn, and walk out next morning and pick up a slow train down the line. Linklater had disappeared towards the guard's van to find his luggage, and the soldiers were sitting on their packs with that air of being utterly and finally lost and neglected which characterizes the British fighting-man on a journey. I gave up my ticket and, since I had come off a northern train, walked unhindered into the town.\n\nIt was market night, and the streets were crowded. Blue-jackets from the Fleet, country-folk in to shop, and every kind of military detail thronged the pavements. Fish-hawkers were crying their wares, and there was a tatterdemalion piper making the night hideous at a corner. I took a tortuous route and finally fixed on a modest-looking public-house in a back street. When I inquired for a room I could find no one in authority, but a slatternly girl informed me that there was one vacant bed, and that I could have ham and eggs in the bar. So, after hitting my head violently against a cross-beam, I stumbled down some steps and entered a frowsty little place smelling of spilt beer and stale tobacco.\n\nThe promised ham and eggs proved impossible--there were no eggs to be had in Muirtown that night--but I was given cold mutton and a pint of indifferent ale. There was nobody in the place but two farmers drinking hot whisky and water and discussing with sombre interest the rise in the price of feeding-stuffs. I ate my supper, and was just preparing to find the whereabouts of my bedroom when through the street door there entered a dozen soldiers.\n\nIn a second the quiet place became a babel. The men were strictly sober; but they were in that temper of friendliness which demands a libation of some kind. One was prepared to stand treat; he was the leader of the lot, and it was to celebrate the end of his leave that he was entertaining his pals. From where I sat I could not see him, but his voice was dominant. 'What's your fancy, jock? Beer for you, Andra? A pint and a dram for me. This is better than vongblong and vongrooge, Davie. Man, when I'm sittin' in those estamints, as they ca' them, I often long for a guid Scots public.'\n\nThe voice was familiar. I shifted my seat to get a view of the speaker, and then I hastily drew back. It was the Scots Fusilier I had clipped on the jaw in defending Gresson after the Glasgow meeting.",
    "I was feeling very pleased with myself. Looking back on my madcap journey, I seemed to have had an amazing run of luck and to be entitled to a little credit too. I told myself that persistence always pays and that nobody is beaten till he is dead. All Blenkiron's instructions had been faithfully carried out. I had found Ivery's post office. I had laid the lines of our own special communications with the enemy, and so far as I could see I had left no clue behind me. Ivery and Gresson took me for a well-meaning nincompoop. It was true that I had aroused profound suspicion in the breasts of the Scottish police. But that mattered nothing, for Cornelius Brand, the suspect, would presently disappear, and there was nothing against that rising soldier, Brigadier-General Richard Hannay, who would soon be on his way to France. After all this piece of service had not been so very unpleasant. I laughed when I remembered my grim forebodings in Gloucestershire. Bullivant had said it would be damnably risky in the long run, but here was the end and I had never been in danger of anything worse than making a fool of myself.\n\nI remember that, as I made my way through Bloomsbury, I was not thinking so much of my triumphant report to Blenkiron as of my speedy return to the Front. Soon I would be with my beloved brigade again. I had missed Messines and the first part of Third Ypres, but the battle was still going on, and I had yet a chance. I might get a division, for there had been talk of that before I left. I knew the Army Commander thought a lot of me. But on the whole I hoped I would be left with the brigade. After all I was an amateur soldier, and I wasn't certain of my powers with a bigger command.\n\nIn Charing Cross Road I thought of Mary, and the brigade seemed suddenly less attractive. I hoped the war wouldn't last much longer, though with Russia heading straight for the devil I didn't know how it was going to stop very soon. I was determined to see Mary before I left, and I had a good excuse, for I had taken my orders from her. The prospect entranced me, and I was mooning along in a happy dream, when I collided violently with in agitated citizen.\n\nThen I realized that something very odd was happening.\n\nThere was a dull sound like the popping of the corks of flat soda-water bottles. There was a humming, too, from very far up in the skies. People in the street were either staring at the heavens or running wildly for shelter. A motor-bus in front of me emptied its contents in a twinkling; a taxi pulled up with a jar and the driver and fare dived into a second-hand bookshop. It took me a moment or two to realize the meaning of it all, and I had scarcely done this when I got a very practical proof. A hundred yards away a bomb fell on a street island, shivering every window-pane in a wide radius, and sending splinters of stone flying about my head. I did what I had done a hundred times before at the Front, and dropped flat on my face.\n\nThe man who says he doesn't mind being bombed or shelled is either a liar or a maniac. This London air raid seemed to me a singularly unpleasant business. I think it was the sight of the decent civilized life around one and the orderly streets, for what was perfectly natural in a rubble-heap like Ypres or Arras seemed an outrage here. I remember once being in billets in a Flanders village where I had the Maire's house and sat in a room upholstered in cut velvet, with wax flowers on the mantelpiece and oil paintings of three generations on the walls. The Boche took it into his head to shell the place with a long-range naval gun, and I simply loathed it. It was horrible to have dust and splinters blown into that snug, homely room, whereas if I had been in a ruined barn I wouldn't have given the thing two thoughts. In the same way bombs dropping in central London seemed a grotesque indecency. I hated to see plump citizens with wild eyes, and nursemaids with scared children, and miserable women scuttling like rabbits in a warren.\n\nThe drone grew louder, and, looking up, I could see the enemy planes flying in a beautiful formation, very leisurely as it seemed, with all London at their mercy. Another bomb fell to the right, and presently bits of our own shrapnel were clattering viciously around me. I thought it about time to take cover, and ran shamelessly for the best place I could see, which was a Tube station. Five minutes before the street had been crowded; now I left behind me a desert dotted with one bus and three empty taxicabs.\n\nI found the Tube entrance filled with excited humanity. One stout lady had fainted, and a nurse had become hysterical, but on the whole people were behaving well. Oddly enough they did not seem inclined to go down the stairs to the complete security of underground; but preferred rather to collect where they could still get a glimpse of the upper world, as if they were torn between fear of their lives and interest in the spectacle. That crowd gave me a good deal of respect for my countrymen. But several were badly rattled, and one man a little way off, whose back was turned, kept twitching his shoulders as if he had the colic.\n\nI watched him curiously, and a movement of the crowd brought his face into profile. Then I gasped with amazement, for I saw that it was Ivery.\n\nAnd yet it was not Ivery. There were the familiar nondescript features, the blandness, the plumpness, but all, so to speak, in ruins. The man was in a blind funk. His features seemed to be dislimning before my eyes. He was growing sharper, finer, in a way younger, a man without grip on himself, a shapeless creature in process of transformation. He was being reduced to his rudiments. Under the spell of panic he was becoming a new man.\n\nAnd the crazy thing was that I knew the new man better than the old.\n\nMy hands were jammed close to my sides by the crowd; I could scarcely turn my head, and it was not the occasion for one's neighbours to observe one's expression. If it had been, mine must have been a study. My mind was far away from air raids, back in the hot summer weather of 1914. I saw a row of villas perched on a headland above the sea. In the garden of one of them two men were playing tennis, while I was crouching behind an adjacent bush. One of these was a plump young man who wore a coloured scarf round his waist and babbled of golf handicaps ... I saw him again in the villa dining-room, wearing a dinner-jacket, and lisping a little.... I sat opposite him at bridge, I beheld him collared by two of Macgillivray's men, when his comrade had rushed for the thirty-nine steps that led to the sea ... I saw, too, the sitting-room of my old flat in Portland Place and heard little Scudder's quick, anxious voice talking about the three men he feared most on earth, one of whom lisped in his speech. I had thought that all three had long ago been laid under the turf ...\n\nHe was not looking my way, and I could devour his face in safety. There was no shadow of doubt. I had always put him down as the most amazing actor on earth, for had he not played the part of the First Sea Lord and deluded that officer's daily colleagues? But he could do far more than any human actor, for he could take on a new personality and with it a new appearance, and live steadily in the character as if he had been born in it ... My mind was a blank, and I could only make blind gropings at conclusions ... How had he escaped the death of a spy and a murderer, for I had last seen him in the hands of justice? ... Of course he had known me from the first day in Biggleswick ... I had thought to play with him, and he had played most cunningly and damnably with me. In that sweating sardine-tin of refugees I shivered in the bitterness of my chagrin.",
    "On 23rd October I had the bad luck, during a tour of my first-line trenches, to stop a small shell-fragment with my head. It was a close, misty day and I had taken off my tin hat to wipe my brow when the thing happened. I got a long, shallow scalp wound which meant nothing but bled a lot, and, as we were not in for any big move, the M.O. sent me back to a clearing station to have it seen to. I was three days in the place and, being perfectly well, had leisure to look about me and reflect, so that I recall that time as a queer, restful interlude in the infernal racket of war. I remember yet how on my last night there a gale made the lamps swing and flicker, and turned the grey-green canvas walls into a mass of mottled shadows. The floor canvas was muddy from the tramping of many feet bringing in the constant dribble of casualties from the line. In my tent there was no one very bad at the time, except a boy with his shoulder half-blown off by a whizz-bang, who lay in a drugged sleep at the far end. The majority were influenza, bronchitis, and trench-fever--waiting to be moved to the base, or convalescent and about to return to their units.\n\nA small group of us dined off tinned chicken, stewed fruit, and radon cheese round the smoky stove, where two screens manufactured from packing cases gave some protection against the draughts which swept like young tornadoes down the tent. One man had been reading a book called the _Ghost Stories of an Antiquary_, and the talk turned on the unexplainable things that happen to everybody once or twice in a lifetime. I contributed a yarn about the men who went to look for Kruger's treasure in the bushveld and got scared by a green wildebeeste. It is a good yarn and I'll write it down some day. A tall Highlander, who kept his slippered feet on the top of the stove, and whose costume consisted of a kilt, a British warm, a grey hospital dressing-gown, and four pairs of socks, told the story of the Camerons at First Ypres, and of the Lowland subaltern who knew no Gaelic and suddenly found himself encouraging his men with some ancient Highland rigmarole. The poor chap had a racking bronchial cough, which suggested that his country might well use him on some warmer battle-ground than Flanders. He seemed a bit of a scholar and explained the Cameron business in a lot of long words.\n\nI remember how the talk meandered on as talk does when men are idle and thinking about the next day. I didn't pay much attention, for I was reflecting on a change I meant to make in one of my battalion commands, when a fresh voice broke in. It belonged to a Canadian captain from Winnipeg, a very silent fellow who smoked shag tobacco.\n\n'There's a lot of ghosts in this darned country,' he said.\n\nThen he started to tell about what happened to him when his division was last back in rest billets. He had a staff job and put up with the divisional command at an old French chateau. They had only a little bit of the house; the rest was shut up, but the passages were so tortuous that it was difficult to keep from wandering into the unoccupied part. One night, he said, he woke with a mighty thirst, and, since he wasn't going to get cholera by drinking the local water in his bedroom, he started out for the room they messed in to try to pick up a whisky-and-soda. He couldn't find it, though he knew the road like his own name. He admitted he might have taken a wrong turning, but he didn't think so. Anyway he landed in a passage which he had never seen before, and, since he had no candle, he tried to retrace his steps. Again he went wrong, and groped on till he saw a faint light which he thought must be the room of the G.S.O., a good fellow and a friend of his. So he barged in, and found a big, dim salon with two figures in it and a lamp burning between them, and a queer, unpleasant smell about. He took a step forward, and then he saw that the figures had no faces. That fairly loosened his joints with fear, and he gave a cry. One of the two ran towards him, the lamp went out, and the sickly scent caught suddenly at his throat. After that he knew nothing till he awoke in his own bed next morning with a splitting headache. He said he got the General's permission and went over all the unoccupied part of the house, but he couldn't find the room. Dust lay thick on everything, and there was no sign of recent human presence.\n\nI give the story as he told it in his drawling voice. 'I reckon that was the genuine article in ghosts. You don't believe me and conclude I was drunk? I wasn't. There isn't any drink concocted yet that could lay me out like that. I just struck a crack in the old universe and pushed my head outside. It may happen to you boys any day.'\n\nThe Highlander began to argue with him, and I lost interest in the talk. But one phrase brought me to attention. 'I'll give you the name of the darned place, and next time you're around you can do a bit of prospecting for yourself. It's called the Chateau of Eaucourt Sainte-Anne, about seven kilometres from Douvecourt. If I was purchasing real estate in this country I guess I'd give that location a miss.'",
    "I stepped on the terrace and listened. There was not a sound in the world, not even the distant rumble of a cart. The pile towered above me like a mausoleum, and I reflected that it must take some nerve to burgle an empty house. It would be good enough fun to break into a bustling dwelling and pinch the plate when the folk were at dinner, but to burgle emptiness and silence meant a fight with the terrors in a man's soul. It was worse in my case, for I wasn't cheered with prospects of loot. I wanted to get inside chiefly to soothe my conscience.\n\nI hadn't much doubt I would find a way, for three years of war and the frequent presence of untidy headquarters' staffs have loosened the joints of most Picardy houses. There's generally a window that doesn't latch or a door that doesn't bar. But I tried window after window on the terrace without result. The heavy green sun-shutters were down over each, and when I broke the hinges of one there was a long bar within to hold it firm. I was beginning to think of shinning up a rain-pipe and trying the second floor, when a shutter I had laid hold on swung back in my hand. It had been left unfastened, and, kicking the snow from my boots, I entered a room.\n\nA gleam of moonlight followed me and I saw I was in a big salon with a polished wood floor and dark lumps of furniture swathed in sheets. I clicked the bulb at my belt, and the little circle of light showed a place which had not been dwelt in for years. At the far end was another door, and as I tiptoed towards it something caught my eye on the parquet. It was a piece of fresh snow like that which clumps on the heel of a boot. I had not brought it there. Some other visitor had passed this way, and not long before me.\n\nVery gently I opened the door and slipped in. In front of me was a pile of furniture which made a kind of screen, and behind that I halted and listened. There was somebody in the room. I heard the sound of human breathing and soft movements; the man, whoever he was, was at the far end from me, and though there was a dim glow of Moon through a broken shutter I could see nothing of what he was after. I was beginning to enjoy myself now. I knew of his presence and he did not know of mine, and that is the sport of stalking.\n\nAn unwary movement of my hand caused the screen to creak. Instantly the movements ceased and there was utter silence. I held my breath, and after a second or two the tiny sounds began again. I had a feeling, though my eyes could not assure me, that the man before me was at work, and was using a very small shaded torch. There was just the faintest moving shimmer on the wall beyond, though that might come from the crack of moonlight.\n\nApparently he was reassured, for his movements became more distinct. There was a jar as if a table had been pushed back. Once more there was silence, and I heard only the intake of breath. I have very quick ears, and to me it sounded as if the man was rattled. The breathing was quick and anxious.\n\nSuddenly it changed and became the ghost of a whistle--the kind of sound one makes with the lips and teeth without ever letting the tune break out clear. We all do it when we are preoccupied with something--shaving, or writing letters, or reading the newspaper. But I did not think my man was preoccupied. He was whistling to quiet fluttering nerves.\n\nThen I caught the air. It was 'Cherry Ripe'.\n\nIn a moment, from being hugely at my ease, I became the nervous one. I had been playing peep-bo with the unseen, and the tables were turned. My heart beat against my ribs like a hammer. I shuffled my feet, and again there fell the tense silence.\n\n'Mary,' I said--and the word seemed to explode like a bomb in the stillness--'Mary! It's me--Dick Hannay.'\n\nThere was no answer but a sob and the sound of a timid step.\n\nI took four paces into the darkness and caught in my arms a trembling girl ... Often in the last months I had pictured the kind of scene which would be the culminating point of my life. When our work was over and war had been forgotten, somewhere--perhaps in a green Cotswold meadow or in a room of an old manor--I would talk with Mary. By that time we should know each other well and I would have lost my shyness. I would try to tell her that I loved her, but whenever I thought of what I should say my heart sank, for I knew I would make a fool of myself. You can't live my kind of life for forty years wholly among men and be of any use at pretty speeches to women. I knew I should stutter and blunder, and I used despairingly to invent impossible situations where I might make my love plain to her without words by some piece of melodramatic sacrifice.\n\nBut the kind Fates had saved me the trouble. Without a syllable save Christian names stammered in that eerie darkness we had come to complete understanding. The fairies had been at work unseen, and the thoughts of each of us had been moving towards the other, till love had germinated like a seed in the dark. As I held her in my arms I stroked her hair and murmured things which seemed to spring out of some ancestral memory. Certainly my tongue had never used them before, nor my mind imagined them ... By and by she slipped her arms round my neck and with a half sob strained towards me. She was still trembling.\n\n'Dick,' she said, and to hear that name on her lips was the sweetest thing I had ever known. 'Dick, is it really you? Tell me I'm not dreaming.'\n\n'It's me, sure enough, Mary dear. And now I have found you I will never let you go again. But, my precious child, how on earth did you get here?'\n\nShe disengaged herself and let her little electric torch wander over my rough habiliments. 'You look a tremendous warrior, Dick. I have never seen you like this before. I was in Doubting Castle and very much afraid of Giant Despair, till you came.'\n\n'I think I call it the Interpreter's House,' I said.\n\n'It's the house of somebody we both know,' she went on. 'He calls himself Bommaerts here. That was one of the two names, you remember. I have seen him since in Paris. Oh, it is a long story and you shall hear it all soon. I knew he came here sometimes, so I came here too. I have been nursing for the last fortnight at the Douvecourt Hospital only four miles away.'",
    "With his first cigar Blenkiron got to business.\n\n'You want to know about the staff-work we've been busy on at home. Well, it's finished now, thanks to you, Dick. We weren't getting on very fast till you took to peroosing the press on your sick-bed and dropped us that hint about the \"Deep-breathing\" ads.'\n\n'Then there was something in it?' I asked.\n\n'There was black hell in it. There wasn't any Gussiter, but there was a mighty fine little syndicate of crooks with old man Gresson at the back of them. First thing, I started out to get the cipher. It took some looking for, but there's no cipher on earth can't be got hold of somehow if you know it's there, and in this case we were helped a lot by the return messages in the German papers. It was bad stuff when we read it, and explained the darned leakages in important noos we've been up against. At first I figured to keep the thing going and turn Gussiter into a corporation with John S. Blenkiron as president. But it wouldn't do, for at the first hint of tampering with their communications the whole bunch got skeery and sent out SOS signals. So we tenderly plucked the flowers.'\n\n'Gresson, too?' I asked.\n\nHe nodded. 'I guess your seafaring companion's now under the sod. We had collected enough evidence to hang him ten times over ... But that was the least of it. For your little old cipher, Dick, gave us a line on Ivery.'\n\nI asked how, and Blenkiron told me the story. He had about a dozen cross-bearings proving that the organization of the 'Deep-breathing' game had its headquarters in Switzerland. He suspected Ivery from the first, but the man had vanished out of his ken, so he started working from the other end, and instead of trying to deduce the Swiss business from Ivery he tried to deduce Ivery from the Swiss business. He went to Berne and made a conspicuous public fool of himself for several weeks. He called himself an agent of the American propaganda there, and took some advertising space in the press and put in spread-eagle announcements of his mission, with the result that the Swiss Government threatened to turn him out of the country if he tampered that amount with their neutrality. He also wrote a lot of rot in the Geneva newspapers, which he paid to have printed, explaining how he was a pacifist, and was going to convert Germany to peace by 'inspirational advertisement of pure-minded war aims'. All this was in keeping with his English reputation, and he wanted to make himself a bait for Ivery.\n\nBut Ivery did not rise to the fly, and though he had a dozen agents working for him on the quiet he could never hear of the name Chelius. That was, he reckoned, a very private and particular name among the Wild Birds. However, he got to know a good deal about the Swiss end of the 'Deep-breathing' business. That took some doing and cost a lot of money. His best people were a girl who posed as a mannequin in a milliner's shop in Lyons and a concierge in a big hotel at St Moritz. His most important discovery was that there was a second cipher in the return messages sent from Switzerland, different from the one that the Gussiter lot used in England. He got this cipher, but though he could read it he couldn't make anything out of it. He concluded that it was a very secret means of communication between the inner circle of the Wild Birds, and that Ivery must be at the back of it ... But he was still a long way from finding out anything that mattered.\n\nThen the whole situation changed, for Mary got in touch with Ivery. I must say she behaved like a shameless minx, for she kept on writing to him to an address he had once given her in Paris, and suddenly she got an answer. She was in Paris herself, helping to run one of the railway canteens, and staying with her French cousins, the de Mezieres. One day he came to see her. That showed the boldness of the man, and his cleverness, for the whole secret police of France were after him and they never got within sight or sound. Yet here he was coming openly in the afternoon to have tea with an English girl. It showed another thing, which made me blaspheme. A man so resolute and single-hearted in his job must have been pretty badly in love to take a risk like that. He came, and he called himself the Capitaine Bommaerts, with a transport job on the staff of the French G.Q.G. He was on the staff right enough too. Mary said that when she heard that name she nearly fell down. He was quite frank with her, and she with him. They are both peacemakers, ready to break the laws of any land for the sake of a great ideal. Goodness knows what stuff they talked together. Mary said she would blush to think of it till her dying day, and I gathered that on her side it was a mixture of Launcelot Wake at his most pedantic and schoolgirl silliness. He came again, and they met often, unbeknown to the decorous Madame de Mezieres. They walked together in the Bois de Boulogne, and once, with a beating heart, she motored with him to Auteuil for luncheon. He spoke of his house in Picardy, and there were moments, I gathered, when he became the declared lover, to be rebuffed with a hoydenish shyness. Presently the pace became too hot, and after some anguished arguments with Bullivant on the long-distance telephone she went off to Douvecourt to Lady Manorwater's hospital. She went there to escape from him, but mainly, I think, to have a look--trembling in every limb, mind you--at the Chateau of Eaucourt Sainte-Anne.",
    "The ice was in shadow and it was bitterly cold. As we crawled up I had not the exercise of using the axe to warm me, and I got very numb standing on one leg waiting for the next step. Worse still, my legs began to cramp. I was in good condition, but that time under Ivery's rack had played the mischief with my limbs. Muscles got out of place in my calves and stood in aching lumps, till I almost squealed with the pain of it. I was mortally afraid I should slip, and every time I moved I called out to Wake to warn him. He saw what was happening and got the pick of his axe fixed in the ice before I was allowed to stir. He spoke often to cheer me up, and his voice had none of its harshness. He was like some ill-tempered generals I have known, very gentle in a battle.\n\nAt the end the snow began to fall, a soft powder like the overspill of a storm raging beyond the crest. It was just after that that Wake cried out that in five minutes we would be at the summit. He consulted his wrist-watch. 'Jolly good time, too. Only twenty-five minutes behind my best. It's not one o'clock.'\n\nThe next I knew I was lying flat on a pad of snow easing my cramped legs, while Wake shouted in my ear that we were in for something bad. I was aware of a driving blizzard, but I had no thought of anything but the blessed relief from pain. I lay for some minutes on my back with my legs stiff in the air and the toes turned inwards, while my muscles fell into their proper place.\n\nIt was certainly no spot to linger in. We looked down into a trough of driving mist, which sometimes swirled aside and showed a knuckle of black rock far below. We ate some chocolate, while Wake shouted in my ear that now we had less step-cutting. He did his best to cheer me, but he could not hide his anxiety. Our faces were frosted over like a wedding-cake and the sting of the wind was like a whiplash on our eyelids.\n\nThe first part was easy, down a slope of firm snow where steps were not needed. Then came ice again, and we had to cut into it below the fresh surface snow. This was so laborious that Wake took to the rocks on the right side of the couloir, where there was some shelter from the main force of the blast. I found it easier, for I knew something about rocks, but it was difficult enough with every handhold and foothold glazed. Presently we were driven back again to the ice, and painfully cut our way through a throat of the ravine where the sides narrowed. There the wind was terrible, for the narrows made a kind of funnel, and we descended, plastered against the wall, and scarcely able to breathe, while the tornado plucked at our bodies as if it would whisk us like wisps of grass into the abyss.\n\nAfter that the gorge widened and we had an easier slope, till suddenly we found ourselves perched on a great tongue of rock round which the snow blew like the froth in a whirlpool. As we stopped for breath, Wake shouted in my ear that this was the Black Stone.\n\n'The what?' I yelled.\n\n'The Schwarzstein. The Swiss call the pass the Schwarzsteinthor. You can see it from Grunewald.'\n\nI suppose every man has a tinge of superstition in him. To hear that name in that ferocious place gave me a sudden access of confidence. I seemed to see all my doings as part of a great predestined plan. Surely it was not for nothing that the word which had been the key of my first adventure in the long tussle should appear in this last phase. I felt new strength in my legs and more vigour in my lungs. 'A good omen,' I shouted. 'Wake, old man, we're going to win out.'\n\n'The worst is still to come,' he said.\n\nHe was right. To get down that tongue of rock to the lower snows of the couloir was a job that fairly brought us to the end of our tether. I can feel yet the sour, bleak smell of wet rock and ice and the hard nerve pain that racked my forehead. The Kaffirs used to say that there were devils in the high berg, and this place was assuredly given over to the powers of the air who had no thought of human life. I seemed to be in the world which had endured from the eternity before man was dreamed of. There was no mercy in it, and the elements were pitting their immortal strength against two pigmies who had profaned their sanctuary. I yearned for warmth, for the glow of a fire, for a tree or blade of grass or anything which meant the sheltered homeliness of mortality. I knew then what the Greeks meant by panic, for I was scared by the apathy of nature. But the terror gave me a kind of comfort, too. Ivery and his doings seemed less formidable. Let me but get out of this cold hell and I could meet him with a new confidence.\n\nWake led, for he knew the road and the road wanted knowing. Otherwise he should have been last on the rope, for that is the place of the better man in a descent. I had some horrible moments following on when the rope grew taut, for I had no help from it. We zigzagged down the rock, sometimes driven to the ice of the adjacent couloirs, sometimes on the outer ridge of the Black Stone, sometimes wriggling down little cracks and over evil boiler-plates. The snow did not lie on it, but the rock crackled with thin ice or oozed ice water. Often it was only by the grace of God that I did not fall headlong, and pull Wake out of his hold to the bergschrund far below. I slipped more than once, but always by a miracle recovered myself. To make things worse, Wake was tiring. I could feel him drag on the rope, and his movements had not the precision they had had in the morning. He was the mountaineer, and I the novice. If he gave out, we should never reach the valley.",
    "'Why, Mr Ivery, come right in,' said the voice at the table. There was a screen before me, stretching from the fireplace to keep off the draught from the door by which I had entered. It stood higher than my head but there were cracks in it through which I could watch the room. I found a little table on which I could lean my back, for I was dropping with fatigue.\n\nBlenkiron sat at the writing-table and in front of him were little rows of Patience cards. Wood ashes still smouldered in the stove, and a lamp stood at his right elbow which lit up the two figures. The bookshelves and the cabinets were in twilight.\n\n'I've been hoping to see you for quite a time.' Blenkiron was busy arranging the little heaps of cards, and his face was wreathed in hospitable smiles. I remember wondering why he should play the host to the true master of the house.\n\nIvery stood erect before him. He was rather a splendid figure now that he had sloughed all disguises and was on the threshold of his triumph. Even through the fog in which my brain worked it was forced upon me that here was a man born to play a big part. He had a jowl like a Roman king on a coin, and scornful eyes that were used to mastery. He was younger than me, confound him, and now he looked it.\n\nHe kept his eyes on the speaker, while a smile played round his mouth, a very ugly smile.\n\n'So,' he said. 'We have caught the old crow too. I had scarcely hoped for such good fortune, and, to speak the truth, I had not concerned myself much about you. But now we shall add you to the bag. And what a bag of vermin to lay out on the lawn!' He flung back his head and laughed.\n\n'Mr Ivery--' Blenkiron began, but was cut short.\n\n'Drop that name. All that is past, thank God! I am the Graf von Schwabing, an officer of the Imperial Guard. I am not the least of the weapons that Germany has used to break her enemies.'\n\n'You don't say,' drawled Blenkiron, still fiddling with his Patience cards.\n\nThe man's moment had come, and he was minded not to miss a jot of his triumph. His figure seemed to expand, his eye kindled, his voice rang with pride. It was melodrama of the best kind and he fairly rolled it round his tongue. I don't think I grudged it him, for I was fingering something in my pocket. He had won all right, but he wouldn't enjoy his victory long, for soon I would shoot him. I had my eye on the very spot above his right ear where I meant to put my bullet ... For I was very clear that to kill him was the only way to protect Mary. I feared the whole seventy millions of Germany less than this man. That was the single idea that remained firm against the immense fatigue that pressed down on me.\n\n'I have little time to waste on you,' said he who had been called Ivery. 'But I will spare a moment to tell you a few truths. Your childish game never had a chance. I played with you in England and I have played with you ever since. You have never made a move but I have quietly countered it. Why, man, you gave me your confidence. The American Mr Donne ...'\n\n'What about Clarence?' asked Blenkiron. His face seemed a study in pure bewilderment.\n\n'I was that interesting journalist.'\n\n'Now to think of that!' said Blenkiron in a sad, gentle voice. 'I thought I was safe with Clarence. Why, he brought me a letter from old Joe Hooper and he knew all the boys down Emporia way.'\n\nIvery laughed. 'You have never done me justice, I fear; but I think you will do it now. Your gang is helpless in my hands. General Hannay ...' And I wish I could give you a notion of the scorn with which he pronounced the word 'General'.\n\n'Yes--Dick?' said Blenkiron intently.\n\n'He has been my prisoner for twenty-four hours. And the pretty Miss Mary, too. You are all going with me in a little to my own country. You will not guess how. We call it the Underground Railway, and you will have the privilege of studying its working.... I had not troubled much about you, for I had no special dislike of you. You are only a blundering fool, what you call in your country easy fruit.'\n\n'I thank you, Graf,' Blenkiron said solemnly.\n\n'But since you are here you will join the others ... One last word. To beat inepts such as you is nothing. There is a far greater thing. My country has conquered. You and your friends will be dragged at the chariot wheels of a triumph such as Rome never saw. Does that penetrate your thick skull? Germany has won, and in two days the whole round earth will be stricken dumb by her greatness.'\n\nAs I watched Blenkiron a grey shadow of hopelessness seemed to settle on his face. His big body drooped in his chair, his eyes fell, and his left hand shuffled limply among his Patience cards. I could not get my mind to work, but I puzzled miserably over his amazing blunders. He had walked blindly into the pit his enemies had dug for him. Peter must have failed to get my message to him, and he knew nothing of last night's work or my mad journey to Italy. We had all bungled, the whole wretched bunch of us, Peter and Blenkiron and myself ... I had a feeling at the back of my head that there was something in it all that I couldn't understand, that the catastrophe could not be quite as simple as it seemed. But I had no power to think, with the insolent figure of Ivery dominating the room ... Thank God I had a bullet waiting for him. That was the one fixed point in the chaos of my mind. For the first time in my life I was resolute on killing one particular man, and the purpose gave me a horrid comfort.\n\nSuddenly Ivery's voice rang out sharp. 'Take your hand out of your pocket. You fool, you are covered from three points in the walls. A movement and my men will make a sieve of you. Others before you have sat in that chair, and I am used to take precautions. Quick. Both hands on the table.'\n\nThere was no mistake about Blenkiron's defeat. He was done and out, and I was left with the only card. He leaned wearily on his arms with the palms of his hands spread out.\n\n'I reckon you've gotten a strong hand, Graf,' he said, and his voice was flat with despair.\n\n'I hold a royal flush,' was the answer.\n\nAnd then suddenly came a change. Blenkiron raised his head, and his sleepy, ruminating eyes looked straight at Ivery.\n\n'I call you,' he said.",
    "Then suddenly the cloud lifted from me, and the blood seemed to run naturally in my veins. I experienced the change of mood which a man feels sometimes when his whole being is fined down and clarified by long endurance. The fight of yesterday revealed itself as something rather splendid. What risks we had run and how gallantly we had met them! My heart warmed as I thought of that old division of mine, those ragged veterans that were never beaten as long as breath was left them. And the Americans and the boys from the machine-gun school and all the oddments we had commandeered! And old Blenkiron raging like a good-tempered lion! It was against reason that such fortitude shouldn't win out. We had snarled round and bitten the Boche so badly that he wanted no more for a little. He would come again, but presently we should be relieved and the gallant blue-coats, fresh as paint and burning for revenge, would be there to worry him.\n\nI had no new facts on which to base my optimism, only a changed point of view. And with it came a recollection of other things. Wake's death had left me numb before, but now the thought of it gave me a sharp pang. He was the first of our little confederacy to go. But what an ending he had made, and how happy he had been in that mad time when he had come down from his pedestal and become one of the crowd! He had found himself at the last, and who could grudge him such happiness? If the best were to be taken, he would be chosen first, for he was a big man, before whom I uncovered my head. The thought of him made me very humble. I had never had his troubles to face, but he had come clean through them, and reached a courage which was for ever beyond me. He was the Faithful among us pilgrims, who had finished his journey before the rest. Mary had foreseen it. 'There is a price to be paid,' she had said--'the best of us.'\n\nAnd at the thought of Mary a flight of warm and happy hopes seemed to settle on my mind. I was looking again beyond the war to that peace which she and I would some day inherit. I had a vision of a green English landscape, with its far-flung scents of wood and meadow and garden ... And that face of all my dreams, with the eyes so childlike and brave and honest, as if they, too, saw beyond the dark to a radiant country. A line of an old song, which had been a favourite of my father's, sang itself in my ears:\n\n   _There's an eye that ever weeps and a fair face will be fain\n   When I ride through Annan Water wi' my bonny bands again!_\n\nWe were standing by the crumbling rails of what had once been the farm sheepfold. I looked at Archie and he smiled back at me, for he saw that my face had changed. Then he turned his eyes to the billowing clouds.\n\nI felt my arm clutched.\n\n'Look there!' said a fierce voice, and his glasses were turned upward.\n\nI looked, and far up in the sky saw a thing like a wedge of wild geese flying towards us from the enemy's country. I made out the small dots which composed it, and my glass told me they were planes. But only Archie's practised eye knew that they were enemy.\n\n'Boche?' I asked.\n\n'Boche,' he said. 'My God, we're for it now.'\n\nMy heart had sunk like a stone, but I was fairly cool. I looked at my watch and saw that it was ten minutes to eleven.\n\n'How many?'\n\n'Five,' said Archie. 'Or there may be six--not more.'\n\n'Listen!' I said. 'Get on to your headquarters. Tell them that it's all up with us if a single plane gets back. Let them get well over the line, the deeper in the better, and tell them to send up every machine they possess and down them all. Tell them it's life or death. Not one single plane goes back. Quick!'\n\nArchie disappeared, and as he went our anti-aircraft guns broke out. The formation above opened and zigzagged, but they were too high to be in much danger. But they were not too high to see that which we must keep hidden or perish.\n\nThe roar of our batteries died down as the invaders passed westward. As I watched their progress they seemed to be dropping lower. Then they rose again and a bank of cloud concealed them.\n\nI had a horrid certainty that they must beat us, that some at any rate would get back. They had seen thin lines and the roads behind us empty of supports. They would see, as they advanced, the blue columns of the French coming up from the south-west, and they would return and tell the enemy that a blow now would open the road to Amiens and the sea. He had plenty of strength for it, and presently he would have overwhelming strength. It only needed a spear-point to burst the jerry-built dam and let the flood through ... They would return in twenty minutes, and by noon we would be broken. Unless--unless the miracle of miracles happened, and they never returned.\n\nArchie reported that his skipper would do his damnedest and that our machines were now going up. 'We've a chance, sir,' he said, 'a good sportin' chance.' It was a new Archie, with a hard voice, a lean face, and very old eyes.\n\nBehind the jagged walls of the farm buildings was a knoll which had once formed part of the high-road. I went up there alone, for I didn't want anybody near me. I wanted a viewpoint, and I wanted quiet, for I had a grim time before me. From that knoll I had a big prospect of country. I looked east to our lines on which an occasional shell was falling, and where I could hear the chatter of machine-guns. West there was peace for the woods closed down on the landscape. Up to the north, I remember, there was a big glare as from a burning dump, and heavy guns seemed to be at work in the Ancre valley. Down in the south there was the dull murmur of a great battle. But just around me, in the gap, the deadliest place of all, there was an odd quiet. I could pick out clearly the different sounds. Somebody down at the farm had made a joke and there was a short burst of laughter. I envied the humorist his composure. There was a clatter and jingle from a battery changing position. On the road a tractor was jolting along--I could hear its driver shout and the screech of its unoiled axle.\n\nMy eyes were glued to my glasses, but they shook in my hands so that I could scarcely see. I bit my lip to steady myself, but they still wavered. From time to time I glanced at my watch. Eight minutes gone--ten--seventeen. If only the planes would come into sight! Even the certainty of failure would be better than this harrowing doubt. They should be back by now unless they had swung north across the salient, or unless the miracle of miracles--\n\nThen came the distant yapping of an anti-aircraft gun, caught up the next second by others, while smoke patches studded the distant blue sky. The clouds were banking in mid-heaven, but to the west there was a big clear space now woolly with shrapnel bursts. I counted them mechanically--one--three--five--nine--with despair beginning to take the place of my anxiety. My hands were steady now, and through the glasses I saw the enemy.\n\nFive attenuated shapes rode high above the bombardment, now sharp against the blue, now lost in a film of vapour. They were coming back, serenely, contemptuously, having seen all they wanted."

  "Baroness Emmuska Orczy Orczy -- The Scarlet Pimpernel": [
    "A surging, seething, murmuring crowd of beings that are human only in name, for to the eye and ear they seem naught but savage creatures, animated by vile passions and by the lust of vengeance and of hate. The hour, some little time before sunset, and the place, the West Barricade, at the very spot where, a decade later, a proud tyrant raised an undying monument to the nation\u2019s glory and his own vanity.\n\nDuring the greater part of the day the guillotine had been kept busy at its ghastly work: all that France had boasted of in the past centuries, of ancient names, and blue blood, had paid toll to her desire for liberty and for fraternity. The carnage had only ceased at this late hour of the day because there were other more interesting sights for the people to witness, a little while before the final closing of the barricades for the night.\n\nAnd so the crowd rushed away from the Place de la Gr\u00e8ve and made for the various barricades in order to watch this interesting and amusing sight.\n\nIt was to be seen every day, for those aristos were such fools! They were traitors to the people of course, all of them, men, women, and children, who happened to be descendants of the great men who since the Crusades had made the glory of France: her old _noblesse_. Their ancestors had oppressed the people, had crushed them under the scarlet heels of their dainty buckled shoes, and now the people had become the rulers of France and crushed their former masters\u2014not beneath their heel, for they went shoeless mostly in these days\u2014but beneath a more effectual weight, the knife of the guillotine.\n\nAnd daily, hourly, the hideous instrument of torture claimed its many victims\u2014old men, young women, tiny children, even until the day when it would finally demand the head of a King and of a beautiful young Queen.\n\nBut this was as it should be: were not the people now the rulers of France? Every aristocrat was a traitor, as his ancestors had been before him: for two hundred years now the people had sweated, and toiled, and starved, to keep a lustful court in lavish extravagance; now the descendants of those who had helped to make those courts brilliant had to hide for their lives\u2014to fly, if they wished to avoid the tardy vengeance of the people.\n\nAnd they did try to hide, and tried to fly: that was just the fun of the whole thing. Every afternoon before the gates closed and the market carts went out in procession by the various barricades, some fool of an aristo endeavoured to evade the clutches of the Committee of Public Safety. In various disguises, under various pretexts, they tried to slip through the barriers which were so well guarded by citizen soldiers of the Republic. Men in women\u2019s clothes, women in male attire, children disguised in beggars\u2019 rags: there were some of all sorts: _ci-devant_ counts, marquises, even dukes, who wanted to fly from France, reach England or some other equally accursed country, and there try to rouse foreign feeling against the glorious Revolution, or to raise an army in order to liberate the wretched prisoners in the Temple, who had once called themselves sovereigns of France.\n\nBut they were nearly always caught at the barricades. Sergeant Bibot especially at the West Gate had a wonderful nose for scenting an aristo in the most perfect disguise. Then, of course, the fun began. Bibot would look at his prey as a cat looks upon the mouse, play with him, sometimes for quite a quarter of an hour, pretend to be hoodwinked by the disguise, by the wigs and other bits of theatrical make-up which hid the identity of a _ci-devant_ noble marquise or count.\n\nOh! Bibot had a keen sense of humour, and it was well worth hanging round that West Barricade, in order to see him catch an aristo in the very act of trying to flee from the vengeance of the people.\n\nSometimes Bibot would let his prey actually out by the gates, allowing him to think for the space of two minutes at least that he really had escaped out of Paris, and might even manage to reach the coast of England in safety, but Bibot would let the unfortunate wretch walk about ten m\u00e8tres towards the open country, then he would send two men after him and bring him back, stripped of his disguise.\n\nOh! that was extremely funny, for as often as not the fugitive would prove to be a woman, some proud marchioness, who looked terribly comical when she found herself in Bibot\u2019s clutches after all, and knew that a summary trial would await her the next day and after that, the fond embrace of Madame la Guillotine.\n\nNo wonder that on this fine afternoon in September the crowd round Bibot\u2019s gate was eager and excited. The lust of blood grows with its satisfaction, there is no satiety: the crowd had seen a hundred noble heads fall beneath the guillotine to-day, it wanted to make sure that it would see another hundred fall on the morrow.\n\n\nBibot was sitting on an overturned and empty cask close by the gate of the barricade; a small detachment of citoyen soldiers was under his command. The work had been very hot lately. Those cursed aristos were becoming terrified and tried their hardest to slip out of Paris: men, women and children, whose ancestors, even in remote ages, had served those traitorous Bourbons, were all traitors themselves and right food for the guillotine. Every day Bibot had had the satisfaction of unmasking some fugitive royalists and sending them back to be tried by the Committee of Public Safety, presided over by that good patriot, Citoyen Foucquier-Tinville.\n\nRobespierre and Danton both had commended Bibot for his zeal, and Bibot was proud of the fact that he on his own initiative had sent at least fifty aristos to the guillotine.\n\nBut to-day all the sergeants in command at the various barricades had had special orders. Recently a very great number of aristos had succeeded in escaping out of France and in reaching England safely. There were curious rumours about these escapes; they had become very frequent and singularly daring; the people\u2019s minds were becoming strangely excited about it all. Sergeant Grospierre had been sent to the guillotine for allowing a whole family of aristos to slip out of the North Gate under his very nose.\n\nIt was asserted that these escapes were organised by a band of Englishmen, whose daring seemed to be unparalleled, and who, from sheer desire to meddle in what did not concern them, spent their spare time in snatching away lawful victims destined for Madame la Guillotine. These rumours soon grew in extravagance; there was no doubt that this band of meddlesome Englishmen did exist; moreover, they seemed to be under the leadership of a man whose pluck and audacity were almost fabulous. Strange stories were afloat of how he and those aristos whom he rescued became suddenly invisible as they reached the barricades and escaped out of the gates by sheer supernatural agency.\n\nNo one had seen these mysterious Englishmen; as for their leader, he was never spoken of, save with a superstitious shudder. Citoyen Foucquier-Tinville would in the course of the day receive a scrap of paper from some mysterious source; sometimes he would find it in the pocket of his coat, at others it would be handed to him by someone in the crowd, whilst he was on his way to the sitting of the Committee of Public Safety. The paper always contained a brief notice that the band of meddlesome Englishmen were at work, and it was always signed with a device drawn in red\u2014a little star-shaped flower, which we in England call the Scarlet Pimpernel. Within a few hours of the receipt of this impudent notice, the citoyens of the Committee of Public Safety would hear that so many royalists and aristocrats had succeeded in reaching the coast, and were on their way to England and safety.\n\nThe guards at the gates had been doubled, the sergeants in command had been threatened with death, whilst liberal rewards were offered for the capture of these daring and impudent Englishmen. There was a sum of five thousand francs promised to the man who laid hands on the mysterious and elusive Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nEveryone felt that Bibot would be that man, and Bibot allowed that belief to take firm root in everybody\u2019s mind; and so, day after day, people came to watch him at the West Gate, so as to be present when he laid hands on any fugitive aristo who perhaps might be accompanied by that mysterious Englishman.\n\n\n\u201cBah!\u201d he said to his trusted corporal, \u201cCitoyen Grospierre was a fool! Had it been me now, at that North Gate last week . . .\u201d\n\nCitoyen Bibot spat on the ground to express his contempt for his comrade\u2019s stupidity.\n\n\n\u201cHow did it happen, citoyen?\u201d asked the corporal.\n\n\n\u201cGrospierre was at the gate, keeping good watch,\u201d began Bibot, pompously, as the crowd closed in round him, listening eagerly to his narrative. \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard of this meddlesome Englishman, this accursed Scarlet Pimpernel. He won\u2019t get through _my_ gate, _morbleu!_ unless he be the devil himself. But Grospierre was a fool. The market carts were going through the gates; there was one laden with casks, and driven by an old man, with a boy beside him. Grospierre was a bit drunk, but he thought himself very clever; he looked into the casks\u2014most of them, at least\u2014and saw they were empty, and let the cart go through.\u201d\n\nA murmur of wrath and contempt went round the group of ill-clad wretches, who crowded round Citoyen Bibot.\n\n\n\u201cHalf an hour later,\u201d continued the sergeant, \u201cup comes a captain of the guard with a squad of some dozen soldiers with him. \u2018Has a cart gone through?\u2019 he asks of Grospierre, breathlessly. \u2018Yes,\u2019 says Grospierre, \u2018not half an hour ago.\u2019 \u2018And you have let them escape,\u2019 shouts the captain furiously. \u2018You\u2019ll go to the guillotine for this, citoyen sergeant! that cart held concealed the _ci-devant_ Duc de Chalis and all his family!\u2019 \u2018What!\u2019 thunders Grospierre, aghast. \u2018Aye! and the driver was none other than that cursed Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel.\u2019\u201d\n\nA howl of execration greeted this tale. Citoyen Grospierre had paid for his blunder on the guillotine, but what a fool! oh! what a fool!\n\nBibot was laughing so much at his own tale that it was some time before he could continue.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018After them, my men,\u2019 shouts the captain,\u201d he said, after a while, \u201c\u2018remember the reward; after them, they cannot have gone far!\u2019 And with that he rushes through the gate, followed by his dozen soldiers.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut it was too late!\u201d shouted the crowd, excitedly.\n\n\u201cThey never got them!\u201d\n\n\u201cCurse that Grospierre for his folly!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe deserved his fate!\u201d\n\n\u201cFancy not examining those casks properly!\u201d\n\nBut these sallies seemed to amuse Citoyen Bibot exceedingly; he laughed until his sides ached, and the tears streamed down his cheeks.\n\n\n\u201cNay, nay!\u201d he said at last, \u201cthose aristos weren\u2019t in the cart; the driver was not the Scarlet Pimpernel!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo! The captain of the guard was that damned Englishman in disguise, and every one of his soldiers aristos!\u201d\n\nThe crowd this time said nothing: the story certainly savoured of the supernatural, and though the Republic had abolished God, it had not quite succeeded in killing the fear of the supernatural in the hearts of the people. Truly that Englishman must be the devil himself.\n\nThe sun was sinking low down in the west. Bibot prepared himself to close the gates.\n\n\n\u201c_En avant_ the carts,\u201d he said.\n\nSome dozen covered carts were drawn up in a row, ready to leave town, in order to fetch the produce from the country close by, for market the next morning. They were mostly well known to Bibot, as they went through his gate twice every day on their way to and from the town. He spoke to one or two of their drivers\u2014mostly women\u2014and was at great pains to examine the inside of the carts.\n\n\n\u201cYou never know,\u201d he would say, \u201cand I\u2019m not going to be caught like that fool Grospierre.\u201d\n\nThe women who drove the carts usually spent their day on the Place de la Gr\u00e8ve, beneath the platform of the guillotine, knitting and gossiping, whilst they watched the rows of tumbrils arriving with the victims the Reign of Terror claimed every day. It was great fun to see the aristos arriving for the reception of Madame la Guillotine, and the places close by the platform were very much sought after. Bibot, during the day, had been on duty on the Place. He recognized most of the old hags, \u201ctricotteuses,\u201d as they were called, who sat there and knitted, whilst head after head fell beneath the knife, and they themselves got quite bespattered with the blood of those cursed aristos.\n\n\n\u201cH\u00e9! la m\u00e8re!\u201d said Bibot to one of these horrible hags, \u201cwhat have you got there?\u201d\n\nHe had seen her earlier in the day, with her knitting and the whip of her cart close beside her. Now she had fastened a row of curly locks to the whip handle, all colours, from gold to silver, fair to dark, and she stroked them with her huge, bony fingers as she laughed at Bibot.\n\n\n\u201cI made friends with Madame Guillotine\u2019s lover,\u201d she said with a coarse laugh, \u201che cut these off for me from the heads as they rolled down. He has promised me some more to-morrow, but I don\u2019t know if I shall be at my usual place.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh! how is that, la m\u00e8re?\u201d asked Bibot, who, hardened soldier though he was, could not help shuddering at the awful loathsomeness of this semblance of a woman, with her ghastly trophy on the handle of her whip.\n\n\n\u201cMy grandson has got the small-pox,\u201d she said with a jerk of her thumb towards the inside of her cart, \u201csome say it\u2019s the plague! If it is, I sha\u2019n\u2019t be allowed to come into Paris to-morrow.\u201d\n\nAt the first mention of the word small-pox, Bibot had stepped hastily backwards, and when the old hag spoke of the plague, he retreated from her as fast as he could.\n\n\n\u201cCurse you!\u201d he muttered, whilst the whole crowd hastily avoided the cart, leaving it standing all alone in the midst of the place.\n\nThe old hag laughed.\n\n\n\u201cCurse you, citoyen, for being a coward,\u201d she said. \u201cBah! what a man to be afraid of sickness.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c_Morbleu!_ the plague!\u201d\n\nEveryone was awe-struck and silent, filled with horror for the loathsome malady, the one thing which still had the power to arouse terror and disgust in these savage, brutalised creatures.\n\n\n\u201cGet out with you and with your plague-stricken brood!\u201d shouted Bibot, hoarsely.\n\nAnd with another rough laugh and coarse jest, the old hag whipped up her lean nag and drove her cart out of the gate.\n\nThis incident had spoilt the afternoon. The people were terrified of these two horrible curses, the two maladies which nothing could cure, and which were the precursors of an awful and lonely death. They hung about the barricades, silent and sullen for a while, eyeing one another suspiciously, avoiding each other as if by instinct, lest the plague lurked already in their midst. Presently, as in the case of Grospierre, a captain of the guard appeared suddenly. But he was known to Bibot, and there was no fear of his turning out to be a sly Englishman in disguise.\n\n\n\u201cA cart, . . .\u201d he shouted breathlessly, even before he had reached the gates.\n\n\n\u201cWhat cart?\u201d asked Bibot, roughly.\n\n\n\u201cDriven by an old hag. . . . A covered cart . . .\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere were a dozen . . .\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAn old hag who said her son had the plague?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes . . .\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou have not let them go?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c_Morbleu!_\u201d said Bibot, whose purple cheeks had suddenly become white with fear.\n\n\n\u201cThe cart contained the _ci-devant_ Comtesse de Tournay and her two children, all of them traitors and condemned to death.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd their driver?\u201d muttered Bibot, as a superstitious shudder ran down his spine.\n\n\n\u201c_Sacr\u00e9 tonnerre_,\u201d said the captain, \u201cbut it is feared that it was that accursed Englishman himself\u2014the Scarlet Pimpernel.\u201d",
    "Straight ahead, Comtesse, the door on your right,\u201d said a pleasant voice outside.\n\n\n\u201cAye! there they are, all right enough,\u201d said Lord Antony, joyfully; \u201coff with you, my pretty Sally, and see how quickly you can dish up the soup.\u201d\n\nThe door was thrown wide open, and, preceded by Mr. Jellyband, who was profuse in his bows and welcomes, a party of four\u2014two ladies and two gentlemen\u2014entered the coffee-room.\n\n\n\u201cWelcome! Welcome to old England!\u201d said Lord Antony, effusively, as he came eagerly forward with both hands outstretched towards the newcomers.\n\n\n\u201cAh, you are Lord Antony Dewhurst, I think,\u201d said one of the ladies, speaking with a strong foreign accent.\n\n\n\u201cAt your service, Madame,\u201d he replied, as he ceremoniously kissed the hands of both the ladies, then turned to the men and shook them both warmly by the hand.\n\nSally was already helping the ladies to take off their travelling cloaks, and both turned, with a shiver, towards the brightly-blazing hearth.\n\nThere was a general movement among the company in the coffee-room. Sally had bustled off to her kitchen, whilst Jellyband, still profuse with his respectful salutations, arranged one or two chairs around the fire. Mr. Hempseed, touching his forelock, was quietly vacating the seat in the hearth. Everyone was staring curiously, yet deferentially, at the foreigners.\n\n\n\u201cAh, Messieurs! what can I say?\u201d said the elder of the two ladies, as she stretched a pair of fine, aristocratic hands to the warmth of the blaze, and looked with unspeakable gratitude first at Lord Antony, then at one of the young men who had accompanied her party, and who was busy divesting himself of his heavy, caped coat.\n\n\n\u201cOnly that you are glad to be in England, Comtesse,\u201d replied Lord Antony, \u201cand that you have not suffered too much from your trying voyage.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIndeed, indeed, we are glad to be in England,\u201d she said, while her eyes filled with tears, \u201cand we have already forgotten all that we have suffered.\u201d\n\nHer voice was musical and low, and there was a great deal of calm dignity and of many sufferings nobly endured marked in the handsome, aristocratic face, with its wealth of snow-white hair dressed high above the forehead, after the fashion of the times.\n\n\n\u201cI hope my friend, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, proved an entertaining travelling companion, Madame?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, indeed, Sir Andrew was kindness itself. How could my children and I ever show enough gratitude to you all, Messieurs?\u201d\n\nHer companion, a dainty, girlish figure, childlike and pathetic in its look of fatigue and of sorrow, had said nothing as yet, but her eyes, large, brown, and full of tears, looked up from the fire and sought those of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, who had drawn near to the hearth and to her; then, as they met his, which were fixed with unconcealed admiration upon the sweet face before him, a thought of warmer colour rushed up to her pale cheeks.\n\n\n\u201cSo this is England,\u201d she said, as she looked round with childlike curiosity at the great open hearth, the oak rafters, and the yokels with their elaborate smocks and jovial, rubicund, British countenances.\n\n\n\u201cA bit of it, Mademoiselle,\u201d replied Sir Andrew, smiling, \u201cbut all of it, at your service.\u201d\n\nThe young girl blushed again, but this time a bright smile, fleet and sweet, illumined her dainty face. She said nothing, and Sir Andrew too was silent, yet those two young people understood one another, as young people have a way of doing all the world over, and have done since the world began.\n\n\n\u201cBut, I say, supper!\u201d here broke in Lord Antony\u2019s jovial voice, \u201csupper, honest Jellyband. Where is that pretty wench of yours and the dish of soup? Zooks, man, while you stand there gaping at the ladies, they will faint with hunger.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne moment! one moment, my lord,\u201d said Jellyband, as he threw open the door that led to the kitchen and shouted lustily: \u201cSally! Hey, Sally there, are ye ready, my girl?\u201d\n\nSally was ready, and the next moment she appeared in the doorway carrying a gigantic tureen, from which rose a cloud of steam and an abundance of savoury odour.\n\n\n\u201cOdd\u2019s my life, supper at last!\u201d ejaculated Lord Antony, merrily, as he gallantly offered his arm to the Comtesse.\n\n\n\u201cMay I have the honour?\u201d he added ceremoniously, as he led her towards the supper table.\n\nThere was general bustle in the coffee-room: Mr. Hempseed and most of the yokels and fisher-folk had gone to make way for \u201cthe quality,\u201d and to finish smoking their pipes elsewhere. Only the two strangers stayed on, quietly and unconcernedly playing their game of dominoes and sipping their wine; whilst at another table Harry Waite, who was fast losing his temper, watched pretty Sally bustling round the table.\n\nShe looked a very dainty picture of English rural life, and no wonder that the susceptible young Frenchman could scarce take his eyes off her pretty face. The Vicomte de Tournay was scarce nineteen, a beardless boy, on whom the terrible tragedies which were being enacted in his own country had made but little impression. He was elegantly and even foppishly dressed, and once safely landed in England he was evidently ready to forget the horrors of the Revolution in the delights of English life.\n\n\n\u201cPardi, if zis is England,\u201d he said as he continued to ogle Sally with marked satisfaction, \u201cI am of it satisfied.\u201d\n\nIt would be impossible at this point to record the exact exclamation which escaped through Mr. Harry Waite\u2019s clenched teeth. Only respect for \u201cthe quality,\u201d and notably for my Lord Antony, kept his marked disapproval of the young foreigner in check.\n\n\n\u201cNay, but this _is_ England, you abandoned young reprobate,\u201d interposed Lord Antony with a laugh, \u201cand do not, I pray, bring your loose foreign ways into this most moral country.\u201d\n\nLord Antony had already sat down at the head of the table with the Comtesse on his right. Jellyband was bustling round, filling glasses and putting chairs straight. Sally waited, ready to hand round the soup. Mr. Harry Waite\u2019s friends had at last succeeded in taking him out of the room, for his temper was growing more and more violent under the Vicomte\u2019s obvious admiration for Sally.\n\n\n\u201cSuzanne,\u201d came in stern, commanding accents from the rigid Comtesse.\n\nSuzanne blushed again; she had lost count of time and of place whilst she had stood beside the fire, allowing the handsome young Englishman\u2019s eyes to dwell upon her sweet face, and his hand, as if unconsciously, to rest upon hers. Her mother\u2019s voice brought her back to reality once more, and with a submissive \u201cYes, Mama,\u201d she too took her place at the supper table.",
    "\u201cYou surprise me, citoyenne,\u201d he said quietly, as he took a pinch of snuff.\n\n\n\u201cDo I now?\u201d she retorted gaily. \u201cFaith, my little Chauvelin, I should have thought that, with your penetration, you would have guessed that an atmosphere composed of fogs and virtues would never suit Marguerite St. Just.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDear me! is it as bad as that?\u201d he asked, in mock consternation.\n\n\n\u201cQuite,\u201d she retorted, \u201cand worse.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStrange! Now, I thought that a pretty woman would have found English country life peculiarly attractive.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes! so did I,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cPretty women,\u201d she added meditatively, \u201cought to have a good time in England, since all the pleasant things are forbidden them\u2014the very things they do every day.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuite so!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hardly believe it, my little Chauvelin,\u201d she said earnestly, \u201cbut I often pass a whole day\u2014a whole day\u2014without encountering a single temptation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo wonder,\u201d retorted Chauvelin, gallantly, \u201cthat the cleverest woman in Europe is troubled with _ennui_.\u201d\n\nShe laughed one of her melodious, rippling, childlike laughs.\n\n\n\u201cIt must be pretty bad, mustn\u2019t it?\u201d she said archly, \u201cor I should not have been so pleased to see you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd this within a year of a romantic love match! . . .\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes! . . . a year of a romantic love match . . . that\u2019s just the difficulty . . .\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh! . . . that idyllic folly,\u201d said Chauvelin, with quiet sarcasm, \u201cdid not then survive the lapse of . . . weeks?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIdyllic follies never last, my little Chauvelin. . . . They come upon us like the measles . . . and are as easily cured.\u201d\n\nChauvelin took another pinch of snuff: he seemed very much addicted to that pernicious habit, so prevalent in those days; perhaps, too, he found the taking of snuff a convenient veil for disguising the quick, shrewd glances with which he strove to read the very souls of those with whom he came in contact.\n\n\n\u201cNo wonder,\u201d he repeated, with the same gallantry, \u201cthat the most active brain in Europe is troubled with _ennui_.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was in hopes that you had a prescription against the malady, my little Chauvelin.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow can I hope to succeed in that which Sir Percy Blakeney has failed to accomplish?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShall we leave Sir Percy out of the question for the present, my dear friend?\u201d she said drily.\n\n\n\u201cAh! my dear lady, pardon me, but that is just what we cannot very well do,\u201d said Chauvelin, whilst once again his eyes, keen as those of a fox on the alert, darted a quick glance at Marguerite. \u201cI have a most perfect prescription against the worst form of _ennui_, which I would have been happy to submit to you, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere _is_ Sir Percy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat has he to do with it?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuite a good deal, I am afraid. The prescription I would offer, fair lady, is called by a very plebeian name: Work!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWork?\u201d\n\nChauvelin looked at Marguerite long and scrutinisingly. It seemed as if those keen, pale eyes of his were reading every one of her thoughts. They were alone together; the evening air was quite still, and their soft whispers were drowned in the noise which came from the coffee-room. Still, Chauvelin took a step or two from under the porch, looked quickly and keenly all round him, then, seeing that indeed no one was within earshot, he once more came back close to Marguerite.\n\n\n\u201cWill you render France a small service, citoyenne?\u201d he asked, with a sudden change of manner, which lent his thin, fox-like face singular earnestness.\n\n\n\u201cLa, man!\u201d she replied flippantly, \u201chow serious you look all of a sudden. . . . Indeed I do not know if I _would_ render France a small service\u2014at any rate, it depends upon the kind of service she\u2014or you\u2014want.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard of the Scarlet Pimpernel, Citoyenne St. Just?\u201d asked Chauvelin, abruptly.\n\n\n\u201cHeard of the Scarlet Pimpernel?\u201d she retorted with a long and merry laugh, \u201cFaith, man! we talk of nothing else. . . . We have hats \u2018\u00e0 la Scarlet Pimpernel\u2019; our horses are called \u2018Scarlet Pimpernel\u2019; at the Prince of Wales\u2019 supper party the other night we had a \u2018ouffl\u00e9 \u00e0 la Scarlet Pimpernel.\u2019 . . . Lud!\u201d she added gaily, \u201cthe other day I ordered at my milliner\u2019s a blue dress trimmed with green, and bless me, if she did not call that \u2018\u00e0 la Scarlet Pimpernel.\u2019\u201d\n\nChauvelin had not moved while she prattled merrily along; he did not even attempt to stop her when her musical voice and her childlike laugh went echoing through the still evening air. But he remained serious and earnest whilst she laughed, and his voice, clear, incisive, and hard, was not raised above his breath as he said,\u2014\n\n\n\u201cThen, as you have heard of that enigmatical personage, citoyenne, you must also have guessed, and known, that the man who hides his identity under that strange pseudonym, is the most bitter enemy of our republic, of France . . . of men like Armand St. Just.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLa! . . .\u201d she said, with a quaint little sigh, \u201cI dare swear he is. . . . France has many bitter enemies these days.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you, citoyenne, are a daughter of France, and should be ready to help her in a moment of deadly peril.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy brother Armand devotes his life to France,\u201d she retorted proudly; \u201cas for me, I can do nothing . . . here in England. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, you . . .\u201d he urged still more earnestly, whilst his thin fox-like face seemed suddenly to have grown impressive and full of dignity, \u201chere, in England, citoyenne . . . you alone can help us. . . . Listen!\u2014I have been sent over here by the Republican Government as its representative: I present my credentials to Mr. Pitt in London to-morrow. One of my duties here is to find out all about this League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, which has become a standing menace to France, since it is pledged to help our cursed aristocrats\u2014traitors to their country, and enemies of the people\u2014to escape from the just punishment which they deserve. You know as well as I do, citoyenne, that once they are over here, those French _\u00e9migr\u00e9s_ try to rouse public feeling against the Republic. . . . They are ready to join issue with any enemy bold enough to attack France. . . . Now, within the last month, scores of these _\u00e9migr\u00e9s_, some only suspected of treason, others actually condemned by the Tribunal of Public Safety, have succeeded in crossing the Channel. Their escape in each instance was planned, organised and effected by this society of young English jackanapes, headed by a man whose brain seems as resourceful as his identity is mysterious. All the most strenuous efforts on the part of my spies have failed to discover who he is; whilst the others are the hands, he is the head, who beneath this strange anonymity calmly works at the destruction of France. I mean to strike at that head, and for this I want your help\u2014through him afterwards I can reach the rest of the gang: he is a young buck in English society, of that I feel sure. Find that man for me, citoyenne!\u201d he urged, \u201cfind him for France!\u201d",
    "It was one of the gala nights at Covent Garden Theatre, the first of the autumn season in this memorable year of grace 1792. The house was packed, both in the smart orchestra boxes and the pit, as well as in the more plebeian balconies and galleries above. Gl\u00fcck\u2019s _Orpheus_ made a strong appeal to the more intellectual portions of the house, whilst the fashionable women, the gaily-dressed and brilliant throng, spoke to the eye of those who cared but little for this \u201clatest importation from Germany.\u201d Selina Storace had been duly applauded after her grand _aria_ by her numerous admirers; Benjamin Incledon, the acknowledged favourite of the ladies, had received special gracious recognition from the royal box; and now the curtain came down after the glorious finale to the second act, and the audience, which had hung spell-bound on the magic strains of the great maestro, seemed collectively to breathe a long sigh of satisfaction, previous to letting loose its hundreds of waggish and frivolous tongues.\n\nIn the smart orchestra boxes many well-known faces were to be seen. Mr. Pitt, overweighted with cares of state, was finding brief relaxation in to-night\u2019s musical treat; the Prince of Wales, jovial, rotund, somewhat coarse and commonplace in appearance, moved about from box to box, spending brief quarters of an hour with those of his more intimate friends. In Lord Grenville\u2019s box, too, a curious, interesting personality attracted everyone\u2019s attention; a thin, small figure with shrewd, sarcastic face and deep-set eyes, attentive to the music, keenly critical of the audience, dressed in immaculate black, with dark hair free from any powder. Lord Grenville\u2014Foreign Secretary of State\u2014paid him marked, though frigid deference. Here and there, dotted about among distinctly English types of beauty, one or two foreign faces stood out in marked contrast: the haughty aristocratic cast of countenance of the many French royalist _\u00e9migr\u00e9s_ who, persecuted by the relentless, revolutionary faction of their country, had found a peaceful refuge in England. On these faces sorrow and care were deeply writ; the women especially paid but little heed, either to the music or to the brilliant audience; no doubt their thoughts were far away with husband, brother, son maybe, still in peril, or lately succumbed to a cruel fate.\n\nAmong these the Comtesse de Tournay de Basserive, but lately arrived from France, was a most conspicuous figure: dressed in deep, heavy black silk, with only a white lace kerchief to relieve the aspect of mourning about her person, she sat beside Lady Portarles, who was vainly trying by witty sallies and somewhat broad jokes, to bring a smile to the Comtesse\u2019s sad mouth. Behind her sat little Suzanne and the Vicomte, both silent and somewhat shy among so many strangers. Suzanne\u2019s eyes seemed wistful; when she first entered the crowded house, she had looked eagerly all around, scanned every face, scrutinised every box. Evidently the one face she wished to see was not there, for she settled herself down quietly behind her mother, listened apathetically to the music, and took no further interest in the audience itself.",
    "A discreet knock at the door roused her from her enjoyment. \u201cCome in,\u201d she said with some impatience, without turning to look at the intruder. Chauvelin, waiting for his opportunity, noted that she was alone, and now, without pausing for that impatient \u201cCome in,\u201d he quietly slipped into the box, and the next moment was standing behind Marguerite\u2019s chair. \u201cA word with you, citoyenne,\u201d he said quietly. Marguerite turned quickly, in alarm, which was not altogether feigned. \u201cLud, man! you frightened me,\u201d she said with a forced little laugh, \u201cyour presence is entirely inopportune. I want to listen to Gl\u00fcck, and have no mind for talking.\u201d \u201cBut this is my only opportunity,\u201d he said, as quietly, and without waiting for permission, he drew a chair close behind her\u2014so close that he could whisper in her ear, without disturbing the audience, and without being seen, in the dark background of the box. \u201cThis is my only opportunity,\u201d he repeated, as she vouchsafed him no reply, \u201cLady Blakeney is always so surrounded, so _f\u00eated_ by her court, that a mere old friend has but very little chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cFaith, man!\u201d she said impatiently, \u201cyou must seek for another opportunity then. I am going to Lord Grenville\u2019s ball to-night after the opera. So are you, probably. I\u2019ll give you five minutes then. . . .\u201d \u201cThree minutes in the privacy of this box are quite sufficient for me,\u201d he rejoined placidly, \u201cand I think that you would be wise to listen to me, Citoyenne St. Just.\u201d Marguerite instinctively shivered. Chauvelin had not raised his voice above a whisper; he was now quietly taking a pinch of snuff, yet there was something in his attitude, something in those pale, foxy eyes, which seemed to freeze the blood in her veins, as would the sight of some deadly hitherto unguessed peril. \u201cIs that a threat, citoyen?\u201d she asked at last. \u201cNay, fair lady,\u201d he said gallantly, \u201conly an arrow shot into the air.\u201d He paused a moment, like a cat which sees a mouse running heedlessly by, ready to spring, yet waiting with that feline sense of enjoyment of mischief about to be done. Then he said quietly\u2014\u201cYour brother, St. Just, is in peril.\u201d\n\nNot a muscle moved in the beautiful face before him. He could only see it in profile, for Marguerite seemed to be watching the stage intently, but Chauvelin was a keen observer; he noticed the sudden rigidity of the eyes, the hardening of the mouth, the sharp, almost paralysed tension of the beautiful, graceful figure. \u201cLud, then,\u201d she said, with affected merriment, \u201csince \u2019tis one of your imaginary plots, you\u2019d best go back to your own seat and leave me to enjoy the music.\u201d And with her hand she began to beat time nervously against the cushion of the box. Selina Storace was singing the \u201cChe far\u00f2\u201d to an audience that hung spellbound upon the prima donna\u2019s lips. Chauvelin did not move from his seat; he quietly watched that tiny nervous hand, the only indication that his shaft had indeed struck home. \u201cWell?\u201d she said suddenly and irrelevantly, and with the same feigned unconcern. \u201cWell, citoyenne?\u201d he rejoined placidly. \u201cAbout my brother?\u201d \u201cI have news of him for you which, I think, will interest you, but first let me explain. . . . May I?\u201d The question was unnecessary. He felt, though Marguerite still held her head steadily averted from him, that her every nerve was strained to hear what he had to say.",
    "Marguerite Blakeney had watched the slight sable-clad figure of Chauvelin, as he worked his way through the ball-room. Then perforce she had had to wait, while her nerves tingled with excitement. Listlessly she sat in the small, still deserted boudoir, looking out through the curtained doorway on the dancing couples beyond: looking at them, yet seeing nothing, hearing the music, yet conscious of naught save a feeling of expectancy, of anxious, weary waiting. Her mind conjured up before her the vision of what was, perhaps at this very moment, passing downstairs. The half-deserted dining-room, the fateful hour\u2014Chauvelin on the watch!\u2014then, precise to the moment, the entrance of a man, he, the Scarlet Pimpernel, the mysterious leader, who to Marguerite had become almost unreal, so strange, so weird was this hidden identity. She wished she were in the supper-room, too, at this moment, watching him as he entered; she knew that her woman\u2019s penetration would at once recognise in the stranger\u2019s face\u2014whoever he might be\u2014that strong individuality which belongs to a leader of men\u2014to a hero: to the mighty, high-soaring eagle, whose daring wings were becoming entangled in the ferret\u2019s trap.\n\nWoman-like, she thought of him with unmixed sadness; the irony of that fate seemed so cruel which allowed the fearless lion to succumb to the gnawing of a rat! Ah! had Armand\u2019s life not been at stake! . . . \u201cFaith! your ladyship must have thought me very remiss,\u201d said a voice suddenly, close to her elbow. \u201cI had a deal of difficulty in delivering your message, for I could not find Blakeney anywhere at first . . .\u201d Marguerite had forgotten all about her husband and her message to him; his very name, as spoken by Lord Fancourt, sounded strange and unfamiliar to her, so completely had she in the last five minutes lived her old life in the Rue de Richelieu again, with Armand always near her to love and protect her, to guard her from the many subtle intrigues which were forever raging in Paris in those days. \u201cI did find him at last,\u201d continued Lord Fancourt, \u201cand gave him your message. He said that he would give orders at once for the horses to be put to.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d she said, still very absently, \u201cyou found my husband, and gave him my message?\u201d \u201cYes; he was in the dining-room fast asleep. I could not manage to wake him up at first.\u201d \u201cThank you very much,\u201d she said mechanically, trying to collect her thoughts.",
    "When Marguerite reached her room, she found her maid terribly anxious about her. \u201cYour ladyship will be so tired,\u201d said the poor woman, whose own eyes were half closed with sleep. \u201cIt is past five o\u2019clock.\u201d \u201cAh, yes, Louise, I daresay I shall be tired presently,\u201d said Marguerite, kindly; \u201cbut you are very tired now, so go to bed at once. I\u2019ll get into bed alone.\u201d \u201cBut, my lady . . .\u201d \u201cNow, don\u2019t argue, Louise, but go to bed. Give me a wrap, and leave me alone.\u201d Louise was only too glad to obey. She took off her mistress\u2019s gorgeous ball-dress, and wrapped her up in a soft billowy gown. \u201cDoes your ladyship wish for anything else?\u201d she asked, when that was done. \u201cNo, nothing more. Put out the lights as you go out.\u201d \u201cYes, my lady. Good-night, my lady.\u201d \u201cGood-night, Louise.\u201d\n\nWhen the maid was gone, Marguerite drew aside the curtains and threw open the windows. The garden and the river beyond were flooded with rosy light. Far away to the east, the rays of the rising sun had changed the rose into vivid gold. The lawn was deserted now, and Marguerite looked down upon the terrace where she had stood a few moments ago trying vainly to win back a man\u2019s love, which once had been so wholly hers. It was strange that through all her troubles, all her anxiety for Armand, she was mostly conscious at the present moment of a keen and bitter heartache. Her very limbs seemed to ache with longing for the love of a man who had spurned her, who had resisted her tenderness, remained cold to her appeals, and had not responded to the glow of passion, which had caused her to feel and hope that those happy olden days in Paris were not all dead and forgotten. How strange it all was! She loved him still. And now that she looked back upon the last few months of misunderstandings and of loneliness, she realised that she had never ceased to love him; that deep down in her heart she had always vaguely felt that his foolish inanities, his empty laugh, his lazy nonchalance were nothing but a mask; that the real man, strong, passionate, wilful, was there still\u2014the man she had loved, whose intensity had fascinated her, whose personality attracted her, since she always felt that behind his apparently slow wits there was a certain something, which he kept hidden from all the world, and most especially from her.\n\nA woman\u2019s heart is such a complex problem\u2014the owner thereof is often most incompetent to find the solution of this puzzle. Did Marguerite Blakeney, \u201cthe cleverest woman in Europe,\u201d really love a fool? Was it love that she had felt for him a year ago when she married him? Was it love she felt for him now that she realised that he still loved her, but that he would not become her slave, her passionate, ardent lover once again? Nay! Marguerite herself could not have told that. Not at this moment at any rate; perhaps her pride had sealed her mind against a better understanding of her own heart. But this she did know\u2014that she meant to capture that obstinate heart back again. That she would conquer once more . . . and then, that she would never lose him . . . . She would keep him, keep his love, deserve it, and cherish it; for this much was certain, that there was no longer any happiness possible for her without that one man\u2019s love.\n\nThus the most contradictory thoughts and emotions rushed madly through her mind. Absorbed in them, she had allowed time to slip by; perhaps, tired out with long excitement, she had actually closed her eyes and sunk into a troubled sleep, wherein quickly fleeting dreams seemed but the continuation of her anxious thoughts\u2014when suddenly she was roused, from dream or meditation, by the noise of footsteps outside her door. Nervously she jumped up and listened; the house itself was as still as ever; the footsteps had retreated. Through her wide-open windows the brilliant rays of the morning sun were flooding her room with light. She looked up at the clock; it was half-past six\u2014too early for any of the household to be already astir. She certainly must have dropped asleep, quite unconsciously. The noise of the footsteps, also of hushed, subdued voices had awakened her\u2014what could they be?\n\nGently, on tip-toe, she crossed the room and opened the door to listen; not a sound\u2014that peculiar stillness of the early morning when sleep with all mankind is at its heaviest. But the noise had made her nervous, and when, suddenly, at her feet, on the very doorstep, she saw something white lying there\u2014a letter evidently\u2014she hardly dared touch it. It seemed so ghostlike. It certainly was not there when she came upstairs; had Louise dropped it? or was some tantalising spook at play, showing her fairy letters where none existed? At last she stooped to pick it up, and, amazed, puzzled beyond measure, she saw that the letter was addressed to herself in her husband\u2019s large, businesslike-looking hand. What could he have to say to her, in the middle of the night, which could not be put off until the morning? She tore open the envelope and read:\u2014\n\n\u201cA most unforeseen circumstance forces me to leave for the North immediately, so I beg your ladyship\u2019s pardon if I do not avail myself of the honour of bidding you good-bye. My business may keep me employed for about a week, so I shall not have the privilege of being present at your ladyship\u2019s water-party on Wednesday. I remain your ladyship\u2019s most humble and most obedient servant,\n\n\nPERCY BLAKENEY.\u201d\n\n\nMarguerite must suddenly have been imbued with her husband\u2019s slowness of intellect, for she had perforce to read the few simple lines over and over again, before she could fully grasp their meaning. She stood on the landing, turning over and over in her hand this curt and mysterious epistle, her mind a blank, her nerves strained with agitation and a presentiment she could not very well have explained. Sir Percy owned considerable property in the North, certainly, and he had often before gone there alone and stayed away a week at a time; but it seemed so very strange that circumstances should have arisen between five and six o\u2019clock in the morning that compelled him to start in this extreme hurry. Vainly she tried to shake off an unaccustomed feeling of nervousness: she was trembling from head to foot. A wild, unconquerable desire seized her to see her husband again, at once, if only he had not already started.",
    "Less than half an hour later, Marguerite, buried in thoughts, sat inside her coach, which was bearing her swiftly to London. She had taken an affectionate farewell of little Suzanne, and seen the child safely started with her maid, and in her own coach, back to town. She had sent one courier with a respectful letter of excuse to His Royal Highness, begging for a postponement of the august visit on account of pressing and urgent business, and another on ahead to bespeak a fresh relay of horses at Faversham. Then she had changed her muslin frock for a dark travelling costume and mantle, had provided herself with money\u2014which her husband\u2019s lavishness always placed fully at her disposal\u2014and had started on her way.\n\nShe did not attempt to delude herself with any vain and futile hopes; the safety of her brother Armand was to have been conditional on the imminent capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel. As Chauvelin had sent her back Armand\u2019s compromising letter, there was no doubt that he was quite satisfied in his own mind that Percy Blakeney was the man whose death he had sworn to bring about. No! there was no room for any fond delusions! Percy, the husband whom she loved with all the ardour which her admiration for his bravery had kindled, was in immediate, deadly peril, through her hand. She had betrayed him to his enemy\u2014unwittingly \u2019tis true\u2014but she _had_ betrayed him, and if Chauvelin succeeded in trapping him, who so far was unaware of his danger, then his death would be at her door. His death! when with her very heart\u2019s blood, she would have defended him and given willingly her life for his.\n\nShe had ordered her coach to drive her to the \u201cCrown\u201d inn; once there, she told her coachman to give the horses food and rest. Then she ordered a chair, and had herself carried to the house in Pall Mall where Sir Andrew Ffoulkes lived. Among all Percy\u2019s friends who were enrolled under his daring banner, she felt that she would prefer to confide in Sir Andrew Ffoulkes. He had always been her friend, and now his love for little Suzanne had brought him closer to her still. Had he been away from home, gone on the mad errand with Percy, perhaps, then she would have called on Lord Hastings or Lord Tony\u2014for she wanted the help of one of these young men, or she would be indeed powerless to save her husband.\n\nSir Andrew Ffoulkes, however, was at home, and his servant introduced her ladyship immediately. She went upstairs to the young man\u2019s comfortable bachelor\u2019s chambers, and was shown into a small, though luxuriously furnished, dining-room. A moment or two later Sir Andrew himself appeared. He had evidently been much startled when he heard who his lady visitor was, for he looked anxiously\u2014even suspiciously\u2014at Marguerite, whilst performing the elaborate bows before her, which the rigid etiquette of the time demanded. Marguerite had laid aside every vestige of nervousness; she was perfectly calm, and having returned the young man\u2019s elaborate salute, she began very calmly,\u2014\n\n\u201cSir Andrew, I have no desire to waste valuable time in much talk. You must take certain things I am going to tell you for granted. These will be of no importance. What is important is that your leader and comrade, the Scarlet Pimpernel . . . my husband . . . Percy Blakeney . . . is in deadly peril.\u201d\n\nHad she had the remotest doubt of the correctness of her deductions, she would have had them confirmed now, for Sir Andrew, completely taken by surprise, had grown very pale, and was quite incapable of making the slightest attempt at clever parrying. \u201cNo matter how I know this, Sir Andrew,\u201d she continued quietly, \u201cthank God that I do, and that perhaps it is not too late to save him. Unfortunately, I cannot do this quite alone, and therefore have come to you for help.\u201d \u201cLady Blakeney,\u201d said the young man, trying to recover himself, \u201cI . . .\u201d \u201cWill you hear me first?\u201d she interrupted. \u201cThis is how the matter stands. When the agent of the French Government stole your papers that night in Dover, he found amongst them certain plans, which you or your leader meant to carry out for the rescue of the Comte de Tournay and others. The Scarlet Pimpernel\u2014Percy, my husband\u2014has gone on this errand himself to-day. Chauvelin knows that the Scarlet Pimpernel and Percy Blakeney are one and the same person. He will follow him to Calais, and there will lay hands on him. You know as well as I do the fate that awaits him at the hands of the Revolutionary Government of France. No interference from England\u2014from King George himself\u2014would save him. Robespierre and his gang would see to it that the interference came too late. But not only that, the much-trusted leader will also have been unconsciously the means of revealing the hiding-place of the Comte de Tournay and of all those who, even now, are placing their hopes in him.\u201d\n\nShe had spoken quietly, dispassionately, and with firm, unbending resolution. Her purpose was to make that young man trust and help her, for she could do nothing without him. \u201cI do not understand,\u201d he repeated, trying to gain time, to think what was best to be done. \u201cAye! but I think you do, Sir Andrew. You must know that I am speaking the truth. Look these facts straight in the face. Percy has sailed for Calais, I presume for some lonely part of the coast, and Chauvelin is on his track. _He_ has posted for Dover, and will cross the Channel probably to-night. What do you think will happen?\u201d\n\nThe young man was silent. \u201cPercy will arrive at his destination: unconscious of being followed he will seek out de Tournay and the others\u2014among these is Armand St. Just, my brother\u2014he will seek them out, one after another, probably, not knowing that the sharpest eyes in the world are watching his every movement. When he has thus unconsciously betrayed those who blindly trust in him, when nothing can be gained from him, and he is ready to come back to England, with those whom he has gone so bravely to save, the doors of the trap will close upon him, and he will be sent to end his noble life upon the guillotine.\u201d",
    "The next quarter of an hour went by swiftly and noiselessly. In the room downstairs, Brogard had for a while busied himself with clearing the table, and re-arranging it for another guest. It was because she watched these preparations that Marguerite found the time slipping by more pleasantly. It was for Percy that this semblance of supper was being got ready. Evidently Brogard had a certain amount of respect for the tall Englishman, as he seemed to take some trouble in making the place look a trifle less uninviting than it had done before. He even produced, from some hidden recess in the old dresser, what actually looked like a table-cloth; and when he spread it out, and saw it was full of holes, he shook his head dubiously for a while, then was at much pains so to spread it over the table as to hide most of its blemishes. Then he got out a serviette, also old and ragged, but possessing some measure of cleanliness, and with this he carefully wiped the glasses, spoons and plates, which he put on the table.\n\nMarguerite could not help smiling to herself as she watched all these preparations, which Brogard accomplished to an accompaniment of muttered oaths. Clearly the great height and bulk of the Englishman, or perhaps the weight of his fist, had overawed this free-born citizen of France, or he would never have been at such trouble for any _sacrr\u00e9 aristo_. When the table was set\u2014such as it was\u2014Brogard surveyed it with evident satisfaction. He then dusted one of the chairs with the corner of his blouse, gave a stir to the stock-pot, threw a fresh bundle of faggots on to the fire, and slouched out of the room.\n\nMarguerite was left alone with her reflections. She had spread her travelling cloak over the straw, and was sitting fairly comfortably, as the straw was fresh, and the evil odours from below came up to her only in a modified form. But, momentarily, she was almost happy; happy because, when she peeped through the tattered curtains, she could see a rickety chair, a torn table-cloth, a glass, a plate and a spoon; that was all. But those mute and ugly things seemed to say to her that they were waiting for Percy; that soon, very soon, he would be here, that the squalid room being still empty, they would be alone together.\n\nThat thought was so heavenly, that Marguerite closed her eyes in order to shut out everything but that. In a few minutes she would be alone with him; she would run down the ladder, and let him see her; then he would take her in his arms, and she would let him see that, after that, she would gladly die for him, and with him, for earth could hold no greater happiness than that. And then what would happen? She could not even remotely conjecture. She knew, of course, that Sir Andrew was right, that Percy would do everything he had set out to accomplish; that she\u2014now she was here\u2014could do nothing, beyond warning him to be cautious, since Chauvelin himself was on his track. After having cautioned him, she would perforce have to see him go off upon his terrible and daring mission; she could not even with a word or look, attempt to keep him back. She would have to obey, whatever he told her to do, even perhaps have to efface herself, and wait, in indescribable agony, whilst he, perhaps, went to his death.\n\nBut even that seemed less terrible to bear than the thought that he should never know how much she loved him\u2014that at any rate would be spared her; the squalid room itself, which seemed to be waiting for him, told her that he would be here soon. Suddenly her over-sensitive ears caught the sound of distant footsteps drawing near; her heart gave a wild leap of joy! Was it Percy at last? No! the step did not seem quite as long, nor quite as firm as his; she also thought that she could hear two distinct sets of footsteps. Yes! that was it! two men were coming this way. Two strangers perhaps, to get a drink, or . . .\n\nBut she had not time to conjecture, for presently there was a peremptory call at the door, and the next moment it was violently thrown open from the outside, whilst a rough, commanding voice shouted,\u2014\n\n\u201cHey! Citoyen Brogard! Hol\u00e1!\u201d\n\nMarguerite could not see the newcomers, but, through a hole in one of the curtains, she could observe one portion of the room below. She heard Brogard\u2019s shuffling footsteps, as he came out of the inner room, muttering his usual string of oaths. On seeing the strangers, however, he paused in the middle of the room, well within range of Marguerite\u2019s vision, looked at them, with even more withering contempt than he had bestowed upon his former guests, and muttered, \u201c_Sacrrr\u00e9e soutane!_\u201d\n\nMarguerite\u2019s heart seemed all at once to stop beating; her eyes, large and dilated, had fastened on one of the newcomers, who, at this point, had taken a quick step forward towards Brogard. He was dressed in the soutane, broad-brimmed hat and buckled shoes habitual to the French _cur\u00e9_, but as he stood opposite the innkeeper, he threw open his soutane for a moment, displaying the tricolour scarf of officialism, which sight immediately had the effect of transforming Brogard\u2019s attitude of contempt, into one of cringing obsequiousness. It was the sight of this French _cur\u00e9_, which seemed to freeze the very blood in Marguerite\u2019s veins. She could not see his face, which was shaded by his broad-brimmed hat, but she recognised the thin, bony hands, the slight stoop, the whole gait of the man! It was Chauvelin!",
    "Chauvelin once again took out his watch; \u201can appointment, perhaps. . . . I pray you take no heed of me. . . . My time\u2019s my own.\u201d\n\nHe rose from the table and dragged a chair to the hearth. Once more Marguerite was terribly tempted to go to him, for time was getting on; Desgas might be back at any moment with his men. Percy did not know that and . . . oh! how horrible it all was\u2014and how helpless she felt.\n\n\n\u201cI am in no hurry,\u201d continued Percy, pleasantly, \u201cbut, la! I don\u2019t want to spend any more time than I can help in this God-forsaken hole! But, begad! sir,\u201d he added, as Chauvelin had surreptitiously looked at his watch for the third time, \u201cthat watch of yours won\u2019t go any faster for all the looking you give it. You are expecting a friend, maybe?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye\u2014a friend!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a lady\u2014I trust, Monsieur l\u2019Abb\u00e9,\u201d laughed Blakeney; \u201csurely the holy Church does not allow? . . . eh? . . . what! But, I say, come by the fire . . . it\u2019s getting demmed cold.\u201d\n\nHe kicked the fire with the heel of his boot, making the logs blaze in the old hearth. He seemed in no hurry to go, and apparently was quite unconscious of his immediate danger. He dragged another chair to the fire, and Chauvelin, whose impatience was by now quite beyond control, sat down beside the hearth, in such a way as to command a view of the door. Desgas had been gone nearly a quarter of an hour. It was quite plain to Marguerite\u2019s aching senses that as soon as he arrived, Chauvelin would abandon all his other plans with regard to the fugitives, and capture this impudent Scarlet Pimpernel at once.\n\n\n\u201cHey, M. Chauvelin,\u201d the latter was saying airily, \u201ctell me, I pray you, is your friend pretty? Demmed smart these little French women sometimes\u2014what? But I protest I need not ask,\u201d he added, as he carelessly strode back towards the supper-table. \u201cIn matters of taste the Church has never been backward. . . . Eh?\u201d\n\nBut Chauvelin was not listening. His every faculty was now concentrated on that door through which presently Desgas would enter. Marguerite\u2019s thoughts, too, were centred there, for her ears had suddenly caught, through the stillness of the night, the sound of numerous and measured treads some distance away.\n\n\nIt was Desgas and his men. Another three minutes and they would be here! Another three minutes and the awful thing would have occurred: the brave eagle would have fallen in the ferret\u2019s trap! She would have moved now and screamed, but she dared not; for whilst she heard the soldiers approaching, she was looking at Percy and watching his every movement. He was standing by the table whereon the remnants of the supper, plates, glasses, spoons, salt and pepper-pots were scattered pell-mell. His back was turned to Chauvelin and he was still prattling along in his own affected and inane way, but from his pocket he had taken his snuff-box, and quickly and suddenly he emptied the contents of the pepper-pot into it.\n\n\nThen he again turned with an inane laugh to Chauvelin,\u2014\n\n\u201cEh? Did you speak, sir?\u201d\n\nChauvelin had been too intent on listening to the sound of those approaching footsteps, to notice what his cunning adversary had been doing. He now pulled himself together, trying to look unconcerned in the very midst of his anticipated triumph.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said presently, \u201cthat is\u2014as you were saying, Sir Percy\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was saying,\u201d said Blakeney, going up to Chauvelin, by the fire, \u201cthat the Jew in Piccadilly has sold me better snuff this time than I have ever tasted. Will you honour me, Monsieur l\u2019Abb\u00e9?\u201d\n\nHe stood close to Chauvelin in his own careless, _d\u00e9bonnaire_ way, holding out his snuff-box to his arch-enemy.\n\n\nChauvelin, who, as he told Marguerite once, had seen a trick or two in his day, had never dreamed of this one. With one ear fixed on those fast-approaching footsteps, one eye turned to that door where Desgas and his men would presently appear, lulled into false security by the impudent Englishman\u2019s airy manner, he never even remotely guessed the trick which was being played upon him.\n\nHe took a pinch of snuff.\n\n\nOnly he, who has ever by accident sniffed vigorously a dose of pepper, can have the faintest conception of the hopeless condition in which such a sniff would reduce any human being.\n\nChauvelin felt as if his head would burst\u2014sneeze after sneeze seemed nearly to choke him; he was blind, deaf, and dumb for the moment, and during that moment Blakeney quietly, without the slightest haste, took up his hat, took some money out of his pocket, which he left on the table, then calmly stalked out of the room!",
    "Never for a moment did Marguerite Blakeney hesitate. The last sounds outside the \u201cChat Gris\u201d had died away in the night. She had heard Desgas giving orders to his men, and then starting off towards the fort, to get a reinforcement of a dozen more men: six were not thought sufficient to capture the cunning Englishman, whose resourceful brain was even more dangerous than his valour and his strength.\n\n\nThen a few minutes later, she heard the Jew\u2019s husky voice again, evidently shouting to his nag, then the rumble of wheels, and noise of a rickety cart bumping over the rough road.\n\nInside the inn, everything was still. Brogard and his wife, terrified of Chauvelin, had given no sign of life; they hoped to be forgotten, and at any rate to remain unperceived: Marguerite could not even hear their usual volleys of muttered oaths.\n\n\nShe waited a moment or two longer, then she quietly slipped down the broken stairs, wrapped her dark cloak closely round her and slipped out of the inn.\n\nThe night was fairly dark, sufficiently so at any rate to hide her dark figure from view, whilst her keen ears kept count of the sound of the cart going on ahead. She hoped by keeping well within the shadow of the ditches which lined the road, that she would not be seen by Desgas\u2019 men, when they approached, or by the patrols, which she concluded were still on duty.\n\n\nThus she started to do this, the last stage of her weary journey, alone, at night, and on foot. Nearly three leagues to Miquelon, and then on to the P\u00e8re Blanchard\u2019s hut, wherever that fatal spot might be, probably over rough roads: she cared not.\n\nThe Jew\u2019s nag could not get on very fast, and though she was weary with mental fatigue and nerve strain, she knew that she could easily keep up with it, on a hilly road, where the poor beast, who was sure to be half-starved, would have to be allowed long and frequent rests. The road lay some distance from the sea, bordered on either side by shrubs and stunted trees, sparsely covered with meagre foliage, all turning away from the North, with their branches looking in the semi-darkness, like stiff, ghostly hair, blown by a perpetual wind.\n\n\nFortunately, the moon showed no desire to peep between the clouds, and Marguerite hugging the edge of the road, and keeping close to the low line of shrubs, was fairly safe from view. Everything around her was so still: only from far, very far away, there came like a long, soft moan, the sound of the distant sea.\n\nThe air was keen and full of brine; after that enforced period of inactivity, inside the evil-smelling, squalid inn, Marguerite would have enjoyed the sweet scent of this autumnal night, and the distant melancholy rumble of the waves; she would have revelled in the calm and stillness of this lonely spot, a calm, broken only at intervals by the strident and mournful cry of some distant gull, and by the creaking of the wheels, some way down the road: she would have loved the cool atmosphere, the peaceful immensity of Nature, in this lonely part of the coast: but her heart was too full of cruel foreboding, of a great ache and longing for a being who had become infinitely dear to her.\n\n\nHer feet slipped on the grassy bank, for she thought it safest not to walk near the centre of the road, and she found it difficult to keep up a sharp pace along the muddy incline. She even thought it best not to keep too near to the cart; everything was so still, that the rumble of the wheels could not fail to be a safe guide.\n\nThe loneliness was absolute. Already the few dim lights of Calais lay far behind, and on this road there was not a sign of human habitation, not even the hut of a fisherman or of a woodcutter anywhere near; far away on her right was the edge of the cliff, below it the rough beach, against which the incoming tide was dashing itself with its constant, distant murmur. And ahead the rumble of the wheels, bearing an implacable enemy to his triumph.\n\n\nMarguerite wondered at what particular spot, on this lonely coast, Percy could be at this moment. Not very far surely, for he had had less than a quarter of an hour\u2019s start of Chauvelin. She wondered if he knew that in this cool, ocean-scented bit of France, there lurked many spies, all eager to sight his tall figure, to track him to where his unsuspecting friends waited for him, and then, to close the net over him and them.\n\n\nChauvelin, on ahead, jolted and jostled in the Jew\u2019s vehicle, was nursing comfortable thoughts. He rubbed his hands together, with content, as he thought of the web which he had woven, and through which that ubiquitous and daring Englishman could not hope to escape. As the time went on, and the old Jew drove him leisurely but surely along the dark road, he felt more and more eager for the grand finale of this exciting chase after the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel. The capture of the audacious plotter would be the finest leaf in Citoyen Chauvelin\u2019s wreath of glory. Caught, red-handed, on the spot, in the very act of aiding and abetting the traitors against the Republic of France, the Englishman could claim no protection from his own country. Chauvelin had, in any case, fully made up his mind that all intervention should come too late.\n\n\nNever for a moment did the slightest remorse enter his heart, as to the terrible position in which he had placed the unfortunate wife, who had unconsciously betrayed her husband. As a matter of fact, Chauvelin had ceased even to think of her: she had been a useful tool, that was all.\n\n\nThe Jew\u2019s lean nag did little more than walk. She was going along at a slow jog trot, and her driver had to give her long and frequent halts.\n\n\u201cAre we a long way yet from Miquelon?\u201d asked Chauvelin from time to time.\n\n\u201cNot very far, your Honour,\u201d was the uniform placid reply.\n\n\u201cWe have not yet come across your friend and mine, lying in a heap in the roadway,\u201d was Chauvelin\u2019s sarcastic comment.\n\n\u201cPatience, noble Excellency,\u201d rejoined the son of Moses, \u201cthey are ahead of us. I can see the imprint of the cart wheels, driven by that traitor, that son of the Amalekite.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sure of the road?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs sure as I am of the presence of those ten gold pieces in the noble Excellency\u2019s pockets, which I trust will presently be mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as I have shaken hands with my friend the tall stranger, they will certainly be yours.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHark, what was that?\u201d said the Jew suddenly.\n\nThrough the stillness, which had been absolute, there could now be heard distinctly the sound of horses\u2019 hoofs on the muddy road.\n\n\n\u201cThey are soldiers,\u201d he added in an awed whisper.",
    "She did not know how long she was thus carried along, she had lost all notion of time and space, and for a few seconds tired nature, mercifully, deprived her of consciousness.\n\n\nWhen she once more realised her state, she felt that she was placed with some degree of comfort upon a man\u2019s coat, with her back resting against a fragment of rock. The moon was hidden again behind some clouds, and the darkness seemed in comparison more intense. The sea was roaring some two hundred feet below her, and on looking all round she could no longer see any vestige of the tiny glimmer of red light.\n\n\nThat the end of the journey had been reached, she gathered from the fact that she heard rapid questions and answers spoken in a whisper quite close to her.\n\n\u201cThere are four men in there, citoyen; they are sitting by the fire, and seem to be waiting quietly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hour?\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly two o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tide?\u201d\n\n\u201cComing in quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe schooner?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously an English one, lying some three kilometres out. But we cannot see her boat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave the men taken cover?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, citoyen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will not blunder?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will not stir until the tall Englishman comes, then they will surround and overpower the five men.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. And the lady?\u201d\n\n\u201cStill dazed, I fancy. She\u2019s close beside you, citoyen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Jew?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gagged, and his legs strapped together. He cannot move or scream.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Then have your gun ready, in case you want it. Get close to the hut and leave me to look after the lady.\u201d\n\n\nDesgas evidently obeyed, for Marguerite heard him creeping away along the stony cliff, then she felt that a pair of warm, thin, talon-like hands took hold of both her own, and held them in a grip of steel.\n\n\n\u201cBefore that handkerchief is removed from your pretty mouth, fair lady,\u201d whispered Chauvelin close to her ear, \u201cI think it right to give you one small word of warning. What has procured me the honour of being followed across the Channel by so charming a companion, I cannot, of course, conceive, but, if I mistake not, the purpose of this flattering attention is not one that would commend itself to my vanity, and I think that I am right in surmising, moreover, that the first sound which your pretty lips would utter, as soon as the cruel gag is removed, would be one that would perhaps prove a warning to the cunning fox, which I have been at such pains to track to his lair.\u201d\n\n\nHe paused a moment, while the steel-like grasp seemed to tighten round her wrist; then he resumed in the same hurried whisper:\u2014\n\n\u201cInside that hut, if again I am not mistaken, your brother, Armand St. Just, waits with that traitor de Tournay, and two other men unknown to you, for the arrival of the mysterious rescuer, whose identity has for so long puzzled our Committee of Public Safety\u2014the audacious Scarlet Pimpernel. No doubt if you scream, if there is a scuffle here, if shots are fired, it is more than likely that the same long legs that brought this scarlet enigma here, will as quickly take him to some place of safety. The purpose then, for which I have travelled all these miles, will remain unaccomplished. On the other hand it only rests with yourself that your brother\u2014Armand\u2014shall be free to go off with you to-night if you like, to England, or any other place of safety.\u201d\n\n\nMarguerite could not utter a sound, as the handkerchief was wound very tightly round her mouth, but Chauvelin was peering through the darkness very closely into her face; no doubt too her hand gave a responsive appeal to his last suggestion, for presently he continued:\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat I want you to do to ensure Armand\u2019s safety is a very simple thing, dear lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Marguerite\u2019s hand seemed to convey to his, in response.\n\n\u201cTo remain\u2014on this spot, without uttering a sound, until I give you leave to speak. Ah! but I think you will obey,\u201d he added, with that funny dry chuckle of his as Marguerite\u2019s whole figure seemed to stiffen, in defiance of this order, \u201cfor let me tell you that if you scream, nay! if you utter one sound, or attempt to move from here, my men\u2014there are thirty of them about\u2014will seize St. Just, de Tournay, and their two friends, and shoot them here\u2014by my orders\u2014before your eyes.\u201d\n\n\nMarguerite had listened to her implacable enemy\u2019s speech with ever-increasing terror. Numbed with physical pain, she yet had sufficient mental vitality in her to realise the full horror of this terrible \u201ceither\u2014or\u201d he was once more putting before her; an \u201ceither\u2014or\u201d ten thousand times more appalling and horrible, than the one he had suggested to her that fatal night at the ball.\n\n\nThis time it meant that she should keep still, and allow the husband she worshipped to walk unconsciously to his death, or that she should, by trying to give him a word of warning, which perhaps might even be unavailing, actually give the signal for her own brother\u2019s death, and that of three other unsuspecting men.\n\n\nShe could not see Chauvelin, but she could almost feel those keen, pale eyes of his fixed maliciously upon her helpless form, and his hurried, whispered words reached her ear, as the death-knell of her last faint, lingering hope.\n\n\u201cNay, fair lady,\u201d he added urbanely, \u201cyou can have no interest in anyone save in St. Just, and all you need do for his safety is to remain where you are, and to keep silent. My men have strict orders to spare him in every way. As for that enigmatic Scarlet Pimpernel, what is he to you? Believe me, no warning from you could possibly save him. And now dear lady, let me remove this unpleasant coercion, which has been placed before your pretty mouth. You see I wish you to be perfectly free, in the choice which you are about to make.\u201d"

  "H. Rider Haggard -- Allan's Wife": [
    "It may be remembered that in the last pages of his diary, written just before his death, Allan Quatermain makes allusion to his long dead wife, stating that he has written of her fully elsewhere. When his death was known, his papers were handed to myself as his literary executor. Among them I found two manuscripts, of which the following is one. The other is simply a record of events wherein Mr. Quatermain was not personally concerned\u2014a Zulu novel, the story of which was told to him by the hero many years after the tragedy had occurred. But with this we have nothing to do at present.\n\nI have often thought (Mr. Quatermain\u2019s manuscript begins) that I would set down on paper the events connected with my marriage, and the loss of my most dear wife. Many years have now passed since that event, and to some extent time has softened the old grief, though Heaven knows it is still keen enough. On two or three occasions I have even begun the record. Once I gave it up because the writing of it depressed me beyond bearing, once because I was suddenly called away upon a journey, and the third time because a Kaffir boy found my manuscript convenient for lighting the kitchen fire.\n\nBut now that I am at leisure here in England, I will make a fourth attempt. If I succeed, the story may serve to interest some one in after years when I am dead and gone; before that I should not wish it to be published. It is a wild tale enough, and suggests some curious reflections.\n\nI am the son of a missionary. My father was originally curate in charge of a small parish in Oxfordshire. He had already been some ten years married to my dear mother when he went there, and he had four children, of whom I was the youngest. I remember faintly the place where we lived. It was an ancient long grey house, facing the road. There was a very large tree of some sort in the garden. It was hollow, and we children used to play about inside of it, and knock knots of wood from the rough bark. We all slept in a kind of attic, and my mother always came and kissed us when we were in bed. I used to wake up and see her bending over me, a candle in her hand. There was a curious kind of pole projecting from the wall over my bed. Once I was dreadfully frightened because my eldest brother made me hang to it by my hands. That is all I remember about our old home. It has been pulled down long ago, or I would journey there to see it.\n\nA little further down the road was a large house with big iron gates to it, and on the top of the gate pillars sat two stone lions, which were so hideous that I was afraid of them. Perhaps this sentiment was prophetic. One could see the house by peeping through the bars of the gates. It was a gloomy-looking place, with a tall yew hedge round it; but in the summer-time some flowers grew about the sun-dial in the grass plat. This house was called the Hall, and Squire Carson lived there. One Christmas\u2014it must have been the Christmas before my father emigrated, or I should not remember it\u2014we children went to a Christmas-tree festivity at the Hall. There was a great party there, and footmen wearing red waistcoats stood at the door. In the dining-room, which was panelled with black oak, was the Christmas-tree. Squire Carson stood in front of it. He was a tall, dark man, very quiet in his manners, and he wore a bunch of seals on his waistcoat. We used to think him old, but as a matter of fact he was then not more than forty. He had been, as I afterwards learned, a great traveller in his youth, and some six or seven years before this date he married a lady who was half a Spaniard\u2014a papist, my father called her. I can remember her well. She was small and very pretty, with a rounded figure, large black eyes, and glittering teeth. She spoke English with a curious accent. I suppose that I must have been a funny child to look at, and I know that my hair stood up on my head then as it does now, for I still have a sketch of myself that my mother made of me, in which this peculiarity is strongly marked. On this occasion of the Christmas-tree I remember that Mrs. Carson turned to a tall, foreign-looking gentleman who stood beside her, and, tapping him affectionately on the shoulder with her gold eye-glasses, said\u2014\u201cLook, cousin\u2014look at that droll little boy with the big brown eyes; his hair is like a\u2014what you call him?\u2014scrubbing-brush. Oh, what a droll little boy!\u201d\n\nThe tall gentleman pulled at his moustache, and, taking Mrs. Carson\u2019s hand in his, began to smooth my hair down with it till I heard her whisper\u2014\u201cLeave go my hand, cousin. Thomas is looking like\u2014like the thunderstorm.\u201d Thomas was the name of Mr. Carson, her husband.\n\nAfter that I hid myself as well as I could behind a chair, for I was shy, and watched little Stella Carson, who was the squire\u2019s only child, giving the children presents off the tree. She was dressed as Father Christmas, with some soft white stuff round her lovely little face, and she had large dark eyes, which I thought more beautiful than anything I had ever seen. At last it came to my turn to receive a present\u2014oddly enough, considered in the light of future events, it was a large monkey. Stella reached it down from one of the lower boughs of the tree and handed it to me, saying\u2014\u201cDat is my Christmas present to you, little Allan Quatermain.\u201d\n\nAs she did so her sleeve, which was covered with cotton wool, spangled over with something that shone, touched one of the tapers and caught fire\u2014how I do not know\u2014and the flame ran up her arm towards her throat. She stood quite still. I suppose that she was paralysed with fear; and the ladies who were near screamed very loud, but did nothing. Then some impulse seized me\u2014perhaps instinct would be a better word to use, considering my age. I threw myself upon the child, and, beating at the fire with my hands, mercifully succeeded in extinguishing it before it really got hold. My wrists were so badly scorched that they had to be wrapped up in wool for a long time afterwards, but with the exception of a single burn upon her throat, little Stella Carson was not much hurt.\n\nThis is all that I remember about the Christmas-tree at the Hall. What happened afterwards is lost to me, but to this day in my sleep I sometimes see little Stella\u2019s sweet face and the stare of terror in her dark eyes as the fire ran up her arm. This, however, is not wonderful, for I had, humanly speaking, saved the life of her who was destined to be my wife.",
    "I inquired what he meant, and learned that this man, Indaba-zimbi, had for some years occupied the position of wizard-in-chief to the tribe, although he was not a member of it, having been born in the country now known as Zululand. But a son of the chief\u2019s, a man of about thirty, had lately set up as a rival in supernatural powers. This irritated Indaba-zimbi beyond measure, and a quarrel ensued between the two witch-doctors that resulted in a challenge to trial by lightning being given and accepted. These were the conditions. The rivals must await the coming of a serious thunderstorm, no ordinary tempest would serve their turn. Then, carrying assegais in their hands, they must take their stand within fifty paces of each other upon a certain patch of ground where the big thunderbolts were observed to strike continually, and by the exercise of their occult powers and invocations to the lightning, must strive to avert death from themselves and bring it on their rival. The terms of this singular match had been arranged a month previously, but no storm worthy of the occasion had arisen. Now the local weather-prophets believed it to be brewing.\n\nI inquired what would happen if neither of the men were struck, and was told that they must then wait for another storm. If they escaped the second time, however, they would be held to be equal in power, and be jointly consulted by the tribe upon occasions of importance.\n\nThe prospect of being a spectator of so unusual a sight overcame my desire to be gone, and I accepted the chief\u2019s invitation to see it out. Before mid-day I regretted it, for though the western heavens grew darker and darker, and the still air heralded the coming of the storm, yet it did not come. By four o\u2019clock, however, it became obvious that it must burst soon\u2014at sunset, the old chief said, and in the company of the whole assembly I moved down to the place of combat. The kraal was built on the top of a hill, and below it the land sloped gently to the banks of a river about half a mile away. On the hither side of the bank was the piece of land that was, the natives said, \u201cloved of the lightning.\u201d Here the magicians took up their stand, while the spectators grouped themselves on the hillside about two hundred yards away\u2014which was, I thought, rather too near to be pleasant. When we had sat there for a while my curiosity overcame me, and I asked leave of the chief to go down and inspect the arena. He said I might do so at my own risk. I told him that the fire from above would not hurt white men, and went to find that the spot was a bed of iron ore, thinly covered with grass, which of course accounted for its attracting the lightning from the storms as they travelled along the line of the river. At each end of this iron-stone area were placed the combatants, Indaba-zimbi facing the east, and his rival the west, and before each there burned a little fire made of some scented root. Moreover they were dressed in all the paraphernalia of their craft, snakeskins, fish-bladders, and I know not what beside, while round their necks hung circlets of baboons\u2019 teeth and bones from human hands. First I went to the western end where the chief\u2019s son stood. He was pointing with his assegai towards the advancing storm, and invoking it in a voice of great excitement.\n\n\u201cCome, fire, and lick up Indaba-zimbi! Hear me, Storm Devil, and lick Indaba-zimbi with your red tongue! Spit on him with your rain! Whirl him away in your breath! Make him as nothing\u2014melt the marrow in his bones! Run into his heart and burn away the lies! Show all the people who is the true Witch Finder! Let me not be put to shame in the eyes of this white man!\u201d\n\nThus he spoke, or rather chanted, and all the while rubbed his broad chest\u2014for he was a very fine man\u2014with some filthy compound of medicine or _mouti_.\n\nAfter a while, getting tired of his song, I walked across the iron-stone, to where Indaba-zimbi sat by his fire. He was not chanting at all, but his performance was much more impressive. It consisted in staring at the eastern sky, which was perfectly clear of cloud, and every now and again beckoning at it with his finger, then turning round to point with the assegai towards his rival. For a while I looked at him in silence. He was a curious wizened man, apparently over fifty years of age, with thin hands that looked as tough as wire. His nose was much sharper than is usual among these races, and he had a queer habit of holding his head sideways like a bird when he spoke, which, in addition to the humour that lurked in his eye, gave him a most comical appearance. Another strange thing about him was that he had a single white lock of hair among his black wool. At last I spoke to him:\n\n\u201cIndaba-zimbi, my friend,\u201d I said, \u201cyou may be a good witch-doctor, but you are certainly a fool. It is no good beckoning at the blue sky while your enemy is getting a start with the storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may be clever, but don\u2019t think you know everything, white man,\u201d the old fellow answered, in a high, cracked voice, and with something like a grin.\n\n\u201cThey call you Iron-tongue,\u201d I went on; \u201cyou had better use it, or the Storm Devil won\u2019t hear you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fire from above runs down iron,\u201d he answered, \u201cso I keep my tongue quiet. Oh, yes, let him curse away, I\u2019ll put him out presently. Look now, white man.\u201d\n\nI looked, and in the eastern sky there grew a cloud. At first it was small, though very black, but it gathered with extraordinary rapidity.\n\nThis was odd enough, but as I had seen the same thing happen before it did not particularly astonish me. It is by no means unusual in Africa for two thunderstorms to come up at the same time from different points of the compass.\n\n\u201cYou had better get on, Indaba-zimbi,\u201d I said, \u201cthe big storm is coming along fast, and will soon eat up that baby of yours,\u201d and I pointed to the west.\n\n\u201cBabies sometimes grow to giants, white man,\u201d said Indaba-zimbi, beckoning away vigorously. \u201cLook now at my cloud-child.\u201d",
    "We were trekking parallel with the Kolong river when a herd of blesbock crossed the track. I fired at one of them and hit it behind. It galloped about a hundred yards with the rest of the herd, then lay down. As we were in want of meat, not having met with any game for a few days past, I jumped on to my horse, and, telling Indaba-zimbi that I would overtake the waggons or meet them on the further side of a rise about an hour\u2019s trek away, I started after the wounded buck. As soon as I came within a hundred yards of it, however, it jumped up and ran away as fast as though it were untouched, only to lie down again at a distance. I followed, thinking that strength would soon fail it. This happened three times. On the third occasion it vanished behind a ridge, and, though by now I was out of both temper and patience, I thought I might as well ride to the crest and see if I could get a shot at it on the further side.\n\nI reached the ridge, which was strewn with stones, looked over it, and saw\u2014a Zulu Impi! I rubbed my eyes and looked again. Yes, there was no doubt of it. They were halted about a thousand yards away, by the water; some were lying down, some were cooking at fires, others were stalking about with spears and shields in their hands; there might have been two thousand or more of them in all. While I was wondering\u2014and that with no little uneasiness\u2014what on earth they could be doing there, suddenly I heard a wild cry to the right and left of me. I glanced first one way, then the other. From either side a great Zulu was bearing down on me, their broad stabbing assegais aloft, and black shields in their left hands. The man to the right was about fifteen yards away, he to the left was not more than ten. On they came, their fierce eyes almost starting out of their heads, and I felt, with a cold thrill of fear, that in another three seconds those broad \u201cbangwans\u201d might be buried in my vitals. On such occasions we act, I suppose, more from instinct than from anything else\u2014there is no time for thought. At any rate, I dropped the reins and, raising my gun, fired point blank at the left-hand man. The bullet struck him in the middle of his shield, pierced it, and passed through him, and over he rolled upon the veldt. I swung round in the saddle; most happily my horse was accustomed to standing still when I fired from his back, also he was so surprised that he did not know which way to shy. The other savage was almost on me; his outstretched shield reached the muzzle of my gun as I pulled the trigger of the left barrel. It exploded, the warrior sprung high into the air, and fell against my horse dead, his spear passing just in front of my face.\n\nWithout waiting to reload, or even to look if the main body of the Zulus had seen the death of their two scouts, I turned my horse and drove my heels into his sides. As soon as I was down the slope of the rise I pulled a little to the right in order to intercept the waggons before the Zulus saw them. I had not gone three hundred yards in this new direction when, to my utter astonishment, I struck a trail marked with waggon-wheels and the hoofs of oxen. Of waggons there must have been at least eight, and several hundred cattle. Moreover, they had passed within twelve hours; I could tell that by the spoor. Then I understood; the Impi was following the track of the waggons, which, in all probability, belonged to a party of emigrant Boers.\n\nThe spoor of the waggons ran in the direction I wished to go, so I followed it. About a mile further on I came to the crest of a rise, and there, about five furlongs away, I saw the waggons drawn up in a rough laager upon the banks of the river. There, too, were my own waggons trekking down the slope towards them.\n\nIn another five minutes I was there. The Boers\u2014for Boers they were\u2014were standing about outside the little laager watching the approach of my two waggons. I called to them, and they turned and saw me. The very first man my eyes fell on was a Boer named Hans Botha, whom I had known well years ago in the Cape. He was not a bad specimen of his class, but a very restless person, with a great objection to authority, or, as he expressed it, \u201ca love of freedom.\u201d He had joined a party of the emigrant Boers some years before, but, as I learned presently, had quarrelled with its leader, and was now trekking away into the wilderness to found a little colony of his own. Poor fellow! It was his last trek.\n\n\u201cHow do you do, Meinheer Botha?\u201d I said to him in Dutch.\n\nThe man looked at me, looked again, then, startled out of his Dutch stolidity, cried to his wife, who was seated on the box of the waggon\u2014\u201cCome here, Frau, come. Here is Allan Quatermain, the Englishman, the son of the \u2018Predicant.\u2019 How goes it, Heer Quatermain, and what is the news down in the Cape yonder?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the news is in the Cape, Hans,\u201d I answered, solemnly; \u201cbut the news here is that there is a Zulu Impi upon your spoor and within two miles of the waggons. That I know, for I have just shot two of their sentries,\u201d and I showed him my empty gun.\n\nFor a moment there was a silence of astonishment, and I saw the bronzed faces of the men turn pale beneath their tan, while one or two of the women gave a little scream, and the children crept to their sides.\n\n\u201cAlmighty!\u201d cried Hans, \u201cthat must be the Umtetwa Regiment that Dingaan sent against the Basutus, but who could not come at them because of the marshes, and so were afraid to return to Zululand, and struck north to join Mosilikatze.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaager up, Carles! Laager up for your lives, and one of you jump on a horse and drive in the cattle.\u201d",
    "The afternoon was now drawing towards evening, but still there were no signs of the Impi. A wild hope struck us that they might have gone on about their business. Ever since Indaba-zimbi had heard that the regiment was supposed to belong to the Umtetwa tribe, he had, I noticed, been plunged in deep thought. Presently he came to me and volunteered to go out and spy upon their movements. At first Hans Botha was against this idea, saying that he was a \u201cverdomde swartzel\u201d\u2014an accursed black creature\u2014and would betray us. I pointed out that there was nothing to betray. The Zulus must know where the waggons were, but it was important for us to gain information of their movements. So it was agreed that Indaba-zimbi should go. I told him this. He nodded his white lock, said \u201cAll right, Macumazahn,\u201d and started. I noticed with some surprise, however, that before he did so he went to the waggon and fetched his \u201cmouti,\u201d or medicine, which, together with his other magical apparatus, he always carried in a skin bag. I asked him why he did this. He answered that it was to make himself invulnerable against the spears of the Zulus. I did not in the least believe his explanation, for in my heart I was sure that he meant to take the opportunity to make a bolt of it, leaving me to my fate. I did not, however, interfere to prevent this, for I had an affection for the old fellow, and sincerely hoped that he might escape the doom which overshadowed us.\n\nSo Indaba-zimbi sauntered off, and as I looked at his retreating form I thought I should never see it again. But I was mistaken, and little knew that he was risking his life, not for the Boers whom he hated one and all, but for me whom in his queer way he loved.\n\nWhen he had gone we completed our preparations for defence, strengthening the waggons and the thorns beneath with earth and stones. Then at sunset we ate and drank as heartily as we could under the circumstances, and when we had done, Hans Botha, as head of the party, offered up prayer to God for our preservation. It was a touching sight to see the burly Dutchman, his hat off, his broad face lit up by the last rays of the setting sun, praying aloud in homely, simple language to Him who alone could save us from the spears of a cruel foe. I remember that the last sentence of his prayer was, \u201cAlmighty, if we must be killed, save the women and children and my little girl Tota from the accursed Zulus, and do not let us be tortured.\u201d\n\nI echoed the request very earnestly in my own heart, that I know, for in common with the others I was dreadfully afraid, and it must be admitted not without reason.\n\nThen the darkness came on, and we took up our appointed places each with a rifle in his hands and peered out into the gloom in silence. Occasionally one of the Boers would light his pipe with a brand from the smouldering fire, and the glow of it would shine for a few moments on his pale, anxious face.\n\nBehind me one of the stout \u201cfraus\u201d lay upon the ground. Even the terror of our position could not keep her heavy eyes from their accustomed sleep, and she snored loudly. On the further side of her, just by the fire, lay little Tota, wrapped in a kaross. She was asleep also, her thumb in her mouth, and from time to time her father would come to look at her.\n\nSo the hours wore on while we waited for the Zulus. But from my intimate knowledge of the habits of natives I had little fear that they would attack us at night, though, had they done so, they could have compassed our destruction with but small loss to themselves. It is not the habit of this people, they like to fight in the light of day\u2014at dawn for preference.\n\nAbout eleven o\u2019clock, just as I was nodding a little at my post, I heard a low whistle outside the laager. Instantly I was wide awake, and all along the line I heard the clicking of locks as the Boers cocked their guns.\n\n\u201cMacumazahn,\u201d said a voice, the voice of Indaba-zimbi, \u201care you there?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cThen hold a light so that I can see how to climb into the laager,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYah! yah! hold a light,\u201d put in one of the Boers. \u201cI don\u2019t trust that black schepsel of yours, Heer Quatermain; he may have some of his countrymen with him.\u201d Accordingly a lantern was produced and held towards the voice. There was Indaba-zimbi alone. We let him into the laager and asked him the news.\n\n\u201cThis is the news, white men,\u201d he said. \u201cI waited till dark, and creeping up to the place where the Zulus are encamped, hid myself behind a stone and listened. They are a great regiment of Umtetwas as Baas Botha yonder thought. They struck the spoor of the waggons three days ago and followed it. To-night they sleep upon their spears, to-morrow at daybreak they will attack the laager and kill everybody. They are very bitter against the Boers, because of the battle at Blood River and the other fights, and that is why they followed the waggons instead of going straight north after Mosilikatze.\u201d\n\nA kind of groan went up from the group of listening Dutchmen.\n\n\u201cI tell you what it is, Heeren,\u201d I said, \u201cinstead of waiting to be butchered here like buck in a pitfall, let us go out now and fall upon the Impi while it sleeps.\u201d\n\nThis proposition excited some discussion, but in the end only one man could be found to vote for it. Boers as a rule lack that dash which makes great soldiers; such forlorn hopes are not in their line, and rather than embark upon them they prefer to take their chance in a laager, however poor that chance may be. For my own part I firmly believe that had my advice been taken we should have routed the Zulus. Seventeen desperate white men, armed with guns, would have produced no small effect upon a camp of sleeping savages. But it was not taken, so it is no use talking about it.\n\nAfter that we went back to our posts, and slowly the weary night wore on towards the dawn. Only those who have watched under similar circumstances while they waited the advent of almost certain and cruel death, can know the torturing suspense of those heavy hours. But they went somehow, and at last in the far east the sky began to lighten, while the cold breath of dawn stirred the tilts of the waggons and chilled me to the bone. The fat Dutchwoman behind me woke with a yawn, then, remembering all, moaned aloud, while her teeth chattered with cold and fear. Hans Botha went to his waggon and got a bottle of peach brandy, from which he poured into a tin pannikin, giving us each a stiff dram, and making attempts to be cheerful as he did so. But his affected jocularity only seemed to depress his comrades the more. Certainly it depressed me.\n\nNow the light was growing, and we could see some way into the mist which still hung densely over the river, and now\u2014ah! there it was. From the other side of the hill, a thousand yards or more from the laager, came a faint humming sound. It grew and grew till it gathered to a chant\u2014the awful war chant of the Zulus. Soon I could catch the words. They were simple enough:\n\n\u201cWe shall slay, we shall slay! Is it not so, my brothers?\nOur spears shall blush blood-red. Is it not so, my brothers?\nFor we are the sucklings of Chaka, blood is our milk, my brothers.\nAwake, children of the Umtetwa, awake!\nThe vulture wheels, the jackal sniffs the air;\nAwake, children of the Umtetwa\u2014cry aloud, ye ringed men:\nThere is the foe, we shall slay them. Is it not so, my brothers?\n_S\u2019gee! S\u2019gee! S\u2019gee!_\u201d\n\n\nSuch is a rough translation of that hateful chant which to this very day I often seem to hear. It does not look particularly imposing on paper, but if, while he waited to be killed, the reader could have heard it as it rolled through the still air from the throats of nearly three thousand warriors singing all to time, he would have found it impressive enough.",
    "They called me the \u201cWhite Spirit.\u201d Could it be that they were keeping me to make me into medicine? I had heard of such things being done by Zulus and kindred tribes, and my blood ran cold at the thought. What an end! To be pounded up, made medicine of, and eaten!\n\nHowever, I had little time for further reflection, for now the whole Impi was pouring back from the donga and river-banks where it had hidden while their ruse was carried out, and once more formed up on the side of the slope. I was taken to the crest of the slope and placed in the centre of the reserve line in the especial charge of a huge Zulu named Bombyane, the same man who had come forward as a herald. This brute seemed to regard me with an affectionate curiosity. Now and again he poked me in the ribs with the handle of his assegai, as though to assure himself that I was solid, and several times he asked me to be so good as to prophesy how many Zulus would be killed before the \u201cAmaboona,\u201d as they called the Boers, were \u201ceaten up.\u201d\n\nAt first I took no notice of him beyond scowling, but presently, goaded into anger, I prophesied that he would be dead in an hour!\n\nHe only laughed aloud. \u201cOh! White Spirit,\u201d he said, \u201cis it so? Well, I\u2019ve walked a long way from Zululand, and shall be glad of a rest.\u201d\n\nAnd he got it shortly, as will be seen.\n\nNow the Zulus began to sing again\u2014\n\n\u201cWe have caught the White Spirit, my brother! my brother!\nIron-Tongue whispered of him, he smelt him out, my brother.\nNow the Maboona are ours\u2014they are already dead, my brother.\u201d\n\n\nSo that treacherous villain Indaba-zimbi had betrayed me. Suddenly the chief of the Impi, a grey-haired man named Sususa, held up his assegai, and instantly there was silence. Then he spoke to some indunas who stood near him. Instantly they ran to the right and left down the first line, saying a word to the captain of each company as they passed him. Presently they were at the respective ends of the line, and simultaneously held up their spears. As they did so, with an awful roar of \u201cBulala Amaboona\u201d\u2014\u201cSlay the Boers,\u201d the entire line, numbering nearly a thousand men, bounded forward like a buck startled from its form, and rushed down upon the little laager. It was a splendid sight to see them, their assegais glittering in the sunlight as they rose and fell above their black shields, their war-plumes bending back upon the wind, and their fierce faces set intently on the foe, while the solid earth shook beneath the thunder of their rushing feet. I thought of my poor friends the Dutchmen, and trembled. What chance had they against so many?\n\nNow the Zulus, running in the shape of a bow so as to wrap the laager round on three sides, were within seventy yards, and now from every waggon broke tongues of fire. Over rolled a number of the Umtetwa, but the rest cared little. Forward they sped straight to the laager, striving to force a way in. But the Boers plied them with volley after volley, and, packed as the Zulus were, the elephant guns loaded with slugs and small shot did frightful execution. Only one man even got on to a waggon, and as he did so I saw a Boer woman strike him on the head with an axe. He fell down, and slowly, amid howls of derision from the two lines on the hill-side, the Zulus drew back.\n\n\u201cLet us go, father!\u201d shouted the soldiers on the slope, among whom I was, to their chief, who had come up. \u201cYou have sent out the little girls to fight, and they are frightened. Let us show them the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d the chief Sususa answered, laughing. \u201cWait a minute and the little girls will grow to women, and women are good enough to fight against Boers!\u201d\n\nThe attacking Zulus heard the mockery of their fellows, and rushed forward again with a roar. But the Boers in the laager had found time to load, and they met with a warm reception. Reserving their fire till the Zulus were packed like sheep in a kraal, they loosed into them with the roers, and the warriors fell in little heaps. But I saw that the blood of the Umtetwas was up; they did not mean to be beaten back this time, and the end was near. See! six men had leapt on to a waggon, slain the man behind it, and sprung into the laager. They were killed there, but others followed, and then I turned my head. But I could not shut my ears to the cries of rage and death, and the terrible _S\u2019gee! S\u2019gee!_ of the savages as they did their work of murder. Once only I looked up and saw poor Hans Botha standing on a waggon smiting down men with the butt of his rifle. The assegais shot up towards him like tongues of steel, and when I looked again he was gone.\n\nI turned sick with fear and rage. But alas! what could I do? They were all dead now, and probably my own turn was coming, only my death would not be so swift.\n\nThe fight was ended, and the two lines on the slope broke their order, and moved down to the laager. Presently we were there, and a dreadful sight it was. Many of the attacking Zulus were dead\u2014quite fifty I should say, and at least a hundred and fifty were wounded, some of them mortally. The chief Sususa gave an order, the dead men were picked up and piled in a heap, while those who were slightly hurt walked off to find some one to tie up their wounds. But the more serious cases met with a different treatment. The chief or one of his indunas considered each case, and if it was in any way bad, the man was taken up and thrown into the river which ran near. None of them offered any objection, though one poor fellow swam to shore again. He did not stop there long, however, for they pushed him back and drowned him by force.\n\nThe strangest case of all was that of the chief\u2019s own brother. He had been captain of the line, and his ankle was smashed by a bullet. Sususa came up to him, and, having examined the wound, rated him soundly for failing in the first onslaught.\n\nThe poor fellow made the excuse that it was not his fault, as the Boers had hit him in the first rush. His brother admitted the truth of this, and talked to him amicably.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said at length, offering him a pinch of snuff, \u201cyou cannot walk again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, chief,\u201d said the wounded man, looking at his ankle.\n\n\u201cAnd to-morrow we must walk far,\u201d went on Sususa.\n\n\u201cYes, chief.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, then, will you sit here on the veldt, or\u2014\u2014\u201d and he nodded towards the river.\n\nThe man dropped his head on his breast for a minute as though in thought. Presently he lifted it and looked Sususa straight in the face.\n\n\u201cMy ankle pains me, my brother,\u201d he said; \u201cI think I will go back to Zululand, for there is the only kraal I wish to see again, even if I creep about it like a snake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well, my brother,\u201d said the chief. \u201cRest softly,\u201d and having shaken hands with him, he gave an order to one of the indunas, and turned away.\n\nThen men came, and, supporting the wounded man, led him down to the banks of the stream. Here, at his request, they tied a heavy stone round his neck, and then threw him into a deep pool. I saw the whole sad scene, and the victim never even winced. It was impossible not to admire the extraordinary courage of the man, or to avoid being struck with the cold-blooded cruelty of his brother the chief. And yet the act was necessary from his point of view. The man must either die swiftly, or be left to perish of starvation, for no Zulu force will encumber itself with wounded men. Years of merciless warfare had so hardened these people that they looked on death as nothing, and were, to do them justice, as willing to meet it themselves as to inflict it on others. When this very Impi had been sent out by the Zulu King Dingaan, it consisted of some nine thousand men. Now it numbered less than three; all the rest were dead. They, too, would probably soon be dead. What did it matter? They lived by war to die in blood. It was their natural end. \u201cKill till you are killed.\u201d That is the motto of the Zulu soldier. It has the merit of simplicity.\n\nMeanwhile the warriors were looting the waggons, including my own, having first thrown all the dead Boers into a heap. I looked at the heap; all of them were there, including the two stout fraus, poor things. But I missed one body, that of Hans Botha\u2019s daughter, little Tota. A wild hope came into my heart that she might have escaped; but no, it was not possible. I could only pray that she was already at rest.",
    "\u201cHendrika, I fear he dies; there is a flask of brandy in my saddle-bag; get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! ah!\u201d grunted a harsh voice in answer; \u201clet him die, Miss Stella. He will bring you bad luck\u2014let him die, I say.\u201d I felt a movement of air above me as though the woman of my vision turned swiftly, and once again I opened my eyes. She had risen, this dream woman. Now I saw that she was tall and graceful as a reed. She was angry, too; her dark eyes flashed, and she pointed with her hand at a female who stood before her, dressed in nondescript kind of clothes such as might be worn by either a man or a woman. The woman was young, of white blood, very short, with bowed legs and enormous shoulders. In face she was not bad-looking, but the brow receded, the chin and ears were prominent\u2014in short, she reminded me of nothing so much as a very handsome monkey. She might have been the missing link.\n\nThe lady was pointing at her with her hand. \u201cHow dare you?\u201d she said. \u201cAre you going to disobey me again? Have you forgotten what I told you, Babyan?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! ah!\u201d grunted the woman, who seemed literally to curl and shrivel up beneath her anger. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me, Miss Stella, because I can\u2019t bear it. I only said it because it was true. I will fetch the brandy.\u201d\n\nThen, dream or no dream, I determined to speak.\n\n\u201cNot brandy,\u201d I gasped in English as well as my swollen tongue would allow; \u201cgive me water.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, he lives!\u201d cried the beautiful girl, \u201cand he talks English. See, sir, here is water in your own bottle; you were quite close to a spring, it is on the other side of the tree.\u201d\n\nI struggled to a sitting position, lifted the bottle to my lips, and drank from it. Oh! that drink of cool, pure water! never had I tasted anything so delicious. With the first gulp I felt life flow back into me. But wisely enough she would not let me have much. \u201cNo more! no more!\u201d she said, and dragged the bottle from me almost by force.\n\n\u201cThe child,\u201d I said\u2014\u201cis the child dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know yet,\u201d she answered. \u201cWe have only just found you, and I tried to revive you first.\u201d\n\nI turned and crept to where Tota lay by the side of Indaba-zimbi. It was impossible to say if they were dead or swooning. The lady sprinkled Tota\u2019s face with the water, which I watched greedily, for my thirst was still awful, while the woman Hendrika did the same office for Indaba-zimbi. Presently, to my vast delight, Tota opened her eyes and tried to cry, but could not, poor little thing, because her tongue and lips were so swollen. But the lady got some water into her mouth, and, as in my case, the effect was magical. We allowed her to drink about a quarter of a pint, and no more, though she cried bitterly for it. Just then old Indaba-zimbi came to with a groan. He opened his eyes, glanced round, and took in the situation.\n\n\u201cWhat did I tell you, Macumazahn?\u201d he gasped, and seizing the bottle, he took a long pull at it.\n\nMeanwhile I sat with my back against the trunk of the great tree and tried to realize the situation. Looking to my left I saw two good horses\u2014one bare-backed, and one with a rudely made lady\u2019s saddle on it. By the side of the horses were two dogs, of a stout greyhound breed, that sat watching us, and near the dogs lay a dead Orib\u00e9 buck, which they had evidently been coursing.\n\n\u201cHendrika,\u201d said the lady presently, \u201cthey must not eat meat just yet. Go look up the tree and see if there is any ripe fruit on it.\u201d\n\nThe woman ran swiftly into the plain and obeyed. Presently she returned. \u201cI see some ripe fruit,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it is high, quite at the top.\u201d\n\n\u201cFetch it,\u201d said the lady.\n\n\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d I thought to myself; but I was much mistaken. Suddenly the woman bounded at least three feet into the air and caught one of the spreading boughs in her large flat hands; then came a swing that would have filled an acrobat with envy\u2014and she was on it.\n\n\u201cNow there is an end,\u201d I thought again, for the next bough was beyond her reach. But again I was mistaken. She stood up on the bough, gripping it with her bare feet, and once more sprang at the one above, caught it and swung herself into it.\n\nI suppose that the lady saw my expression of astonishment. \u201cDo not wonder, sir,\u201d she said, \u201cHendrika is not like other people. She will not fall.\u201d\n\nI made no answer, but watched the progress of this extraordinary person with the most breathless interest. On she went, swinging herself from bough to bough, and running along them like a monkey. At last she reached the top, and began to swarm up a thin branch towards the ripe fruit. When she was near enough she shook the branch violently. There was a crack\u2014a crash\u2014it broke. I shut my eyes, expecting to see her crushed on the ground before me.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d said the lady again, laughing gently. \u201cLook, she is quite safe.\u201d\n\nI looked, and so she was. She had caught a bough as she fell, clung to it, and was now calmly dropping to another. Old Indaba-zimbi had also watched this performance with interest, but it did not seem to astonish him over-much. \u201cBaboon-woman?\u201d he said, as though such people were common, and then turned his attention to soothing Tota, who was moaning for more water. Meanwhile Hendrika came down the tree with extraordinary rapidity, and swinging by one hand from a bough, dropped about eight feet to the ground.\n\nIn another two minutes we were all three sucking the pulpy fruit. In an ordinary way we should have found it tasteless enough: as it was I thought it the most delicious thing I had ever tasted. After three days spent without food or water, in the desert, one is not particular. While we were still eating the fruit, the lady of my vision set her companion to work to partially flay the orib\u00e9 which her dogs had killed, and busied herself in making a fire of fallen boughs. As soon as it burned brightly she took strips of the orib\u00e9 flesh, toasted them, and gave them to us on leaves. We ate, and now were allowed a little more water. After that she took Tota to the spring and washed her, which she sadly needed, poor child! Next came our turn to wash, and oh, the joy of it!\n\nI came back to the tree, walking painfully, indeed, but a changed man. There sat the beautiful girl with Tota on her knees. She was lulling her to sleep, and held up her finger to me enjoining silence. At last the child went off into a sound natural slumber\u2014an example that I should have been glad to follow had it not been for my burning curiosity. Then I spoke.\n\n\u201cMay I ask what your name is?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cStella,\u201d she answered.\n\n\u201cStella what?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cStella nothing,\u201d she answered, in some pique; \u201cStella is my name; it is short and easy to remember at any rate. My father\u2019s name is Thomas, and we live up there,\u201d and she pointed round the base of the great peak. I looked at her astonished. \u201cHave you lived there long?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cEver since I was seven years old. We came there in a waggon. Before that we came from England\u2014from Oxfordshire; I can show you the place on a big map. It is called Garsingham.\u201d\n\nAgain I thought I must be dreaming. \u201cDo you know, Miss Stella,\u201d I said, \u201cit is very strange\u2014so strange that it almost seems as though it could not be true\u2014but I also came from Garsingham in Oxfordshire many years ago.\u201d\n\nShe started up. \u201cAre you an English gentleman?\u201d she said. \u201cAh, I have always longed to see an English gentleman. I have never seen but one Englishman since we lived here, and he certainly was not a gentleman\u2014no white people at all, indeed, except a few wandering Boers. We live among black people and baboons\u2014only I have read about English people\u2014lots of books\u2014poetry and novels. But tell me what is your name? Macumazahn the black man called you, but you must have a white name, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Allan Quatermain,\u201d I said.\n\nHer face turned quite white, her rosy lips parted, and she looked at me wildly with her beautiful dark eyes.\n\n\u201cIt is wonderful,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I have often heard that name. My father has told me how a little boy called Allan Quatermain once saved my life by putting out my dress when it was on fire\u2014see!\u201d\u2014and she pointed to a faint red mark upon her neck\u2014\u201chere is the scar of the burn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember it,\u201d I said. \u201cYou were dressed up as Father Christmas. It was I who put out the fire; my wrists were burnt in doing so.\u201d\n\nThen for a space we sat silent, looking at each other, while Stella slowly fanned herself with her wide felt hat, in which some white ostrich plumes were fixed.\n\n\u201cThis is God\u2019s doing,\u201d she said at last. \u201cYou saved my life when I was a child; now I have saved yours and the little girl\u2019s. Is she your own daughter?\u201d she added, quickly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I answered; \u201cI will tell you the tale presently.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cyou shall tell me as we go home. It is time to be starting home, it will take us three hours to get there. Hendrika, Hendrika, bring the horses here!\u201d",
    "\u201cWhether my father is right or wrong, you can judge for yourself. You see Hendrika\u2014we named her that after Hendrik, who caught her\u2014she is a woman, not a monkey, and yet she has many of the ways of monkeys, and looks like one too. You saw how she can climb, for instance, and you hear how she talks. Also she is very savage, and when she is angry or jealous she seems to go mad, though she is as clever as anybody. I think that she must have been stolen by the baboons when she was quite tiny and nurtured by them, and that is why she is so like them.\n\n\u201cBut to go on. My father said that it was our duty to keep Hendrika at any cost. The worst of it was, that for three days she would eat nothing, and I thought that she would die, for all the while she sat and wailed. On the third day, however, I went to the bars of the window place, and held out a cup of milk and some fruit to her. She looked at it for a long while, then crept up moaning, took the milk from my hand, drank it greedily, and afterwards ate the fruit. From that time forward she took food readily enough, but only if I would feed her.\n\n\u201cBut I must tell you of the dreadful end of Hendrik. From the day that we captured Hendrika the whole place began to swarm with baboons which were evidently employed in watching the kraals. One day Hendrik went out towards the hills alone to gather some medicine. He did not come back again, so the next day search was made. By a big rock which I can show you, they found his scattered and broken bones, the fragments of his assegai, and four dead baboons. They had set upon him and torn him to pieces.\n\n\u201cMy father was very much frightened at this, but still he would not let Hendrika go, because he said that she was human, and that it was our duty to reclaim her. And so we did\u2014to a certain extent, at least. After the murder of Hendrik, the baboons vanished from the neighbourhood, and have only returned quite recently, so at length we ventured to let Hendrika out. By this time she had grown very fond of me; still, on the first opportunity she ran away. But in the evening she returned again. She had been seeking the baboons, and could not find them. Shortly afterwards she began to speak\u2014I taught her\u2014and from that time she has loved me so that she will not leave me. I think it would kill her if I went away from her. She watches me all day, and at night sleeps on the floor of my hut. Once, too, she saved my life when I was swept down the river in flood; but she is jealous, and hates everybody else. Look, how she is glaring at you now because I am talking to you!\u201d\n\nI looked. Hendrika was tramping along with the child in her arms and staring at me in a most sinister fashion out of the corners of her eyes.\n\nWhile I was reflecting on the Baboon-woman\u2019s strange story, and thinking that she was an exceedingly awkward customer, the path took a sudden turn.",
    "\u201cLook!\u201d said Stella, \u201cthere is our home. Is it not beautiful?\u201d\n\nIt was beautiful indeed. Here on the western side of the great peak a bay had been formed in the mountain, which might have measured eight hundred or a thousand yards across by three-quarters of a mile in depth. At the back of this indentation the sheer cliff rose to the height of several hundred feet, and behind it and above it the great Babyan Peak towered up towards the heavens. The space of ground, embraced thus in the arms of the mountain, as it were, was laid out, as though by the cunning hand of man, in three terraces that rose one above the other. To the right and left of the topmost terrace were chasms in the cliff, and down each chasm fell a waterfall, from no great height, indeed, but of considerable volume. These two streams flowed away on either side of the enclosed space, one towards the north, and the other, the course of which we had been following, round the base of the mountain. At each terrace they made a cascade, so that the traveller approaching had a view of eight waterfalls at once. Along the edge of the stream to our left were placed Kaffir kraals, built in orderly groups with verandahs, after the Basutu fashion, and a very large part of the entire space of land was under cultivation. All of this I noted at once, as well as the extraordinary richness and depth of the soil, which for many ages past had been washed down from the mountain heights. Then following the line of an excellent waggon road, on which we now found ourselves, that wound up from terrace to terrace, my eye lit upon the crowning wonder of the scene. For in the centre of the topmost platform or terrace, which may have enclosed eight or ten acres of ground, and almost surrounded by groves of orange trees, gleamed buildings of which I had never seen the like. There were three groups of them, one in the middle, and one on either side, and a little to the rear, but, as I afterwards discovered, the plan of all was the same. In the centre was an edifice constructed like an ordinary Zulu hut\u2014that is to say, in the shape of a beehive, only it was five times the size of any hut I ever saw, and built of blocks of hewn white marble, fitted together with extraordinary knowledge of the principles and properties of arch building, and with so much accuracy and finish that it was often difficult to find the joints of the massive blocks. From this centre hut ran three covered passages, leading to other buildings of an exactly similar character, only smaller, and each whole block was enclosed by a marble wall about four feet in height.\n\nOf course we were as yet too far off to see all these details, but the general outline I saw at once, and it astonished me considerably. Even old Indaba-zimbi, whom the Baboon-woman had been unable to move, deigned to show wonder.\n\n\u201cOu!\u201d he said; \u201cthis is a place of marvels. Who ever saw kraals built of white stone?\u201d\n\nStella watched our faces with an expression of intense amusement, but said nothing.\n\n\u201cDid your father build those kraals?\u201d I gasped, at length.\n\n\u201cMy father! no, of course not,\u201d she answered. \u201cHow would it have been possible for one white man to do so, or to have made this road? He found them as you see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho built them, then?\u201d I said again.\n\n\u201cI do not know. My father thinks that they are very ancient, for the people who live here now do not know how to lay one stone upon another, and these huts are so wonderfully constructed that, though they must have stood for ages, not a stone of them had fallen. But I can show you the quarry where the marble was cut; it is close by and behind it is the entrance to an ancient mine, which my father thinks was a silver mine. Perhaps the people who worked the mine built the marble huts. The world is old, and no doubt plenty of people have lived in it and been forgotten.\u201d\n\nThen we rode on in silence. I have seen many beautiful sights in Africa, and in such matters, as in others, comparisons are odious and worthless, but I do not think that I ever saw a lovelier scene. It was no one thing\u2014it was the combination of the mighty peak looking forth on to the everlasting plains, the great cliffs, the waterfalls that sparkled in rainbow hues, the rivers girdling the rich cultivated lands, the gold-specked green of the orange trees, the flashing domes of the marble huts, and a thousand other things. Then over all brooded the peace of evening, and the infinite glory of the sunset that filled heaven with changing hues of splendour, that wrapped the mountain and cliffs in cloaks of purple and of gold, and lay upon the quiet face of the water like the smile of a god.\n\nPerhaps also the contrast, and the memory of those three awful days and nights in the hopeless desert, enhanced the charm, and perhaps the beauty of the girl who walked beside me completed it. For of this I am sure, that of all sweet and lovely things that I looked on then, she was the sweetest and the loveliest.\n\nAh, it did not take me long to find my fate. How long will it be before I find her once again?",
    "All the rest of that day I passed in her company, and the greater part of the two following days. At last came Saturday night, the eve of our marriage. It rained that night, so we did not go out, but spent the evening in the hut. We sat hand in hand, saying little, but Mr. Carson talked a good deal, telling us tales of his youth, and of countries that he had visited. Then he read aloud from the Bible, and bade us goodnight. I also kissed Stella and went to bed. I reached my hut by the covered way, and before I undressed opened the door to see what the night was like. It was very dark, and rain was still falling, but as the light streamed out into the gloom I fancied that I caught sight of a dusky form gliding away. The thought of Hendrika flashed into my mind; could she be skulking about outside there? Now I had said nothing of Hendrika and her threats either to Mr. Carson or Stella, because I did not wish to alarm them. Also I knew that Stella was attached to this strange person, and I did not wish to shake her confidence in her unless it was absolutely necessary. For a minute or two I stood hesitating, then, reflecting that if it was Hendrika, there she should stop, I went in and put up the stout wooden bar that was used to secure the door. For the last few nights old Indaba-zimbi had made a habit of sleeping in the covered passage, which was the only other possible way of access. As I came to bed I had stepped over him rolled up in his blanket, and to all appearances fast asleep. So it being evident that I had nothing to fear, I promptly dismissed the matter from my mind, which, as may be imagined, was indeed fully occupied with other thoughts.\n\nI got into bed, and for awhile lay awake thinking of the great happiness in store for me, and of the providential course of events that had brought it within my reach. A few weeks since and I was wandering in the desert a dying man, bearing a dying child, and with scarcely a possession left in the world except a store of buried ivory that I never expected to see again. And now I was about to wed one of the sweetest and loveliest women on the whole earth\u2014a woman whom I loved more than I could have thought possible, and who loved me back again. Also, as though that were not good fortune enough, I was to acquire with her very considerable possessions, quite sufficiently large to enable us to follow any plan of life we found agreeable. As I lay and reflected on all this I grew afraid of my good fortune. Old Indaba-zimbi\u2019s melancholy prophecies came into my mind. Hitherto he had always prophesied truly. What if these should be true also? I turned cold as I thought of it, and prayed to the Power above to preserve us both to live and love together. Never was prayer more needed. While its words were still upon my lips I dropped asleep and dreamed a most dreadful dream.\n\nI dreamed that Stella and I were standing together to be married. She was dressed in white, and radiant with beauty, but it was a wild, spiritual beauty which frightened me. Her eyes shone like stars, a pale flame played about her features, and the wind that blew did not stir her hair. Nor was this all, for her white robes were death wrappings, and the altar at which we stood was formed of the piled-up earth from an open grave that yawned between us. So we stood waiting for one to wed us, but no one came. Presently from the open grave sprang the form of Hendrika. In her hand was a knife, with which she stabbed at me, but pierced the heart of Stella, who, without a cry, fell backwards into the grave, still looking at me as she fell. Then Hendrika leaped after her into the grave. I heard her feet strike heavily.\n\n\u201c_Awake, Macumazahn! awake!_\u201d cried the voice of Indaba-zimbi.\n\nI awoke and bounded from the bed, a cold perspiration pouring from me. In the darkness on the other side of the hut I heard sounds of furious struggling. Luckily I kept my head. Just by me was a chair on which were matches and a rush taper. I struck a match and held it to the taper. Now in the growing light I could see two forms rolling one over the other on the floor, and from between them came the flash of steel. The fat melted and the light burnt up. It was Indaba-zimbi and the woman Hendrika who were struggling, and, what is more, the woman was getting the better of the man, strong as he was. I rushed towards them. Now she was uppermost, now she had wrenched herself from his fierce grip, and now the great knife she had in her hand flashed up.",
    "We gained the spot by the stream where Stella had been taken. The natives looked at the torn fragments of the dogs, and at the marks of violence, and I heard them swearing to each other, that whether the Star lived or died they would not rest till they had exterminated every baboon on Babyan\u2019s Peak. I echoed the oath, and, as shall be seen, we kept it.\n\nWe started on along the stream, following the spoor of the baboons as we best could. But the stream left no spoor, and the hard, rocky banks very little. Still we wandered on. All night we wandered through the lonely moonlit valleys, startling the silence into a thousand echoes with our cries. But no answer came to them. In vain our eyes searched the sides of precipices formed of water-riven rocks fantastically piled one upon another; in vain we searched through endless dells and fern-clad crannies. There was nothing to be found. How could we expect to find two human beings hidden away in the recesses of this vast stretch of mountain ground, which no man yet had ever fully explored. They were lost, and in all human probability lost for ever.\n\nTo and fro we wandered hopelessly, till at last dawn found us footsore and weary nearly at the spot whence we had started. We sat down waiting for the sun to rise, and the men ate of such food as they had brought with them, and sent to the kraals for more.\n\nI sat upon a stone with a breaking heart. I cannot describe my feelings. Let the reader put himself in my position and perhaps he may get some idea of them. Near me was old Indaba-zimbi, who sat staring straight before him as though he were looking into space, and taking note of what went on there. An idea struck me. This man had some occult power. Several times during our adventures he had prophesied, and in every case his prophecies had proved true. He it was who, when we escaped from the Zulu Impi, had told me to steer north, because there we should find the place of a white man who lived under the shadow of a great peak that was full of baboons. Perhaps he could help in this extremity\u2014at any rate it was worth trying.\n\n\u201cIndaba-zimbi,\u201d I said, \u201cyou say that you can send your spirit through the doors of space and see what we cannot see. At the least I know that you can do strange things. Can you not help me now? If you can, and will save her, I will give you half the cattle that we have here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said anything of the sort, Macumazahn,\u201d he answered. \u201cI do things, I do not talk about them. Neither do I seek reward for what I do like a common witch-doctor. It is well that you have asked me to use my wisdom, Macumazahn, for I should not have used it again without being asked\u2014no, not even for the sake of the Star and yourself, whom I love, for if so my Spirit would have been angry. In the other matters I had a part, for my life was concerned as well as yours; but in this matter I have no part, and therefore I might not use my wisdom unless you thought well to call upon my Spirit. However, it would have been no good to ask me before, for I have only just found the herb I want,\u201d and he produced a handful of the leaves of a plant that was unfamiliar to me. It had prickly leaves, shaped very much like those of the common English nettle.\n\n\u201cNow, Macumazahn,\u201d he went on, \u201cbid the men leave us alone, and then follow me presently to the little glade down there by the water.\u201d",
    "I did so. When I reached the glade I found Indaba-zimbi kindling a small fire under the shadow of a tree by the edge of the water.\n\n\u201cSit there, Macumazahn,\u201d he said, pointing to a stone near the fire, \u201cand do not be surprised or frightened at anything you see. If you move or call out we shall learn nothing.\u201d\n\nI sat down and watched. When the fire was alight and burning brightly, the old fellow stripped himself stark naked, and, going to the foot of the pool, dipped himself in the water. Then he came back shivering with the cold, and, leaning over the little fire, thrust leaves of the plant I have mentioned into his mouth and began to chew them, muttering as he chewed. Most of the remaining leaves he threw on to the fire. A dense smoke rose from them, but he held his head in this smoke and drew it down his lungs till I saw that he was exhibiting every sign of suffocation. The veins in his throat and chest swelled, he gasped loudly, and his eyes, from which tears were streaming, seemed as though they were going to start from his head. Presently he fell over on his side, and lay senseless. I was terribly alarmed, and my first impulse was to run to his assistance, but fortunately I remembered his caution, and sat quiet.\n\nIndaba-zimbi lay on the ground like a person quite dead. His limbs had all the utter relaxation of death. But as I watched I saw them begin to stiffen, exactly as though _rigor mortis_ had set in. Then, to my astonishment, I perceived them once more relax, and this time there appeared upon his chest the stain of decomposition. It spread and spread; in three minutes the man, to all appearance, was a livid corpse.\n\nI sat amazed watching this uncanny sight, and wondering if any further natural process was about to be enacted. Perhaps Indaba-zimbi was going to fall to dust before my eyes. As I watched I observed that the discoloration was beginning to fade. First it vanished from the extremities, then from the larger limbs, and lastly from the trunk. Then in turn came the third stage of relaxation, the second stage of stiffness or _rigor_, and the first stage of after-death collapse. When all these had rapidly succeeded each other, Indaba-zimbi quietly woke up.\n\nI was too astonished to speak; I simply looked at him with my mouth open.\n\n\u201cWell, Macumazahn,\u201d he said, putting his head on one side like a bird, and nodding his white lock in a comical fashion, \u201cit is all right; I have seen her.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeen who?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThe Star, your wife, and the little maid. They are much frightened, but unharmed. The Babyan-frau watches them. She is mad, but the baboons obey her, and do not hurt them. The Star was sleeping from weariness, so I whispered in her ear and told her not to be frightened, for you would soon rescue her, and that meanwhile she must seem to be pleased to have Hendrika near her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou whispered in her ear?\u201d I said. \u201cHow could you whisper in her ear?\u201d\n\n\u201cBah! Macumazahn. How could I seem to die and go rotten before your eyes? You don\u2019t know, do you? Well, I will tell you one thing. I had to die to pass the doors of space, as you call them. I had to draw all the healthy strength and life from my body in order to gather power to speak with the Star. It was a dangerous business, Macumazahn, for if I had let things go a little further they must have stopped so, and there would have been an end of Indaba-zimbi. Ah, you white men, you know so much that you think you know everything. But you don\u2019t! You are always staring at the clouds and can\u2019t see the things that lie at your feet. You hardly believe me now, do you, Macumazahn? Well, I will show you. Have you anything on you that the Star has touched or worn?\u201d\n\nI thought for a moment, and said that I had a lock of her hair in my pocket-book. He told me to give it him. I did so. Going to the fire, he lit the lock of hair in the flame, and let it burn to ashes, which he caught in his left hand. These ashes he mixed up in a paste with the juice of one of the leaves of the plant I have spoken of.\n\n\u201cNow, Macumazahn, shut your eyes,\u201d he said.\n\nI did so, and he rubbed his paste on to my eyelids. At first it burnt me, then my head swam strangely. Presently this effect passed off, and my brain was perfectly clear again, but I could not feel the ground with my feet. Indaba-zimbi led me to the side of the stream. Beneath us was a pool of beautifully clear water.\n\n\u201cLook into the pool, Macumazahn,\u201d said Indaba-zimbi, and his voice sounded hollow and far away in my ears.\n\nI looked. The water grew dark; it cleared, and in it was a picture. I saw a cave with a fire burning in it. Against the wall of the cave rested Stella. Her dress was torn almost off her, she looked dreadfully pale and weary, and her eyelids were red as though with weeping. But she slept, and I could almost think that I saw her lips shape my name in her sleep. Close to her, her head upon Stella\u2019s breast, was little Tota; she had a skin thrown over her to keep out the night cold. The child was awake, and appeared to be moaning with fear. By the fire, and in such a position that the light fell full upon her face, and engaged in cooking something in a rough pot shaped from wood, sat the Baboon-woman, Hendrika. She was clothed in baboon skins, and her face had been rubbed with some dark stain, which was, however, wearing off it. In the intervals of her cooking she would turn on Stella her wild eyes, in which glared visible madness, with an expression of tenderness that amounted to worship. Then she would stare at the child and gnash her teeth as though with hate. Clearly she was jealous of it. Round the entrance arch of the cave peeped and peered the heads of many baboons. Presently Hendrika made a sign to one of them; apparently she did not speak, or rather grunt, in order not to wake Stella. The brute hopped forward, and she gave it a second rude wooden pot which was lying by her. It took it and went. The last thing that I saw, as the vision slowly vanished from the pool, was the dim shadow of the baboon returning with the pot full of water.",
    "The fight was over. In all we had lost seven men killed, and several more severely bitten, while but few had escaped without some tokens whereby he might remember what a baboon\u2019s teeth and claws are like. How many of the brutes we killed I never knew, because we did not count, but it was a vast number. I should think that the stock must have been low about Babyan\u2019s Peak for many years afterwards. From that day to this, however, I have always avoided baboons, feeling more afraid of them than any beast that lives.\n\nThe path was clear, and we rushed forward along the water-course. But first we picked up little Tota. The child was not in a swoon, as I had thought, but paralyzed by terror, so that she could scarcely speak. Otherwise she was unhurt, though it took her many a week to recover her nerve. Had she been older, and had she not remembered Hendrika, I doubt if she would have recovered it. She knew me again, and flung her little arms about my neck, clinging to me so closely that I did not dare to give her to any one else to carry lest I should add to her terrors. So I went on with her in my arms. The fears that pierced my heart may well be imagined. Should I find Stella living or dead? Should I find her at all? Well, we should soon know now. We stumbled on up the stony watercourse; notwithstanding the weight of Tota I led the way, for suspense lent me wings. Now we were through, and an extraordinary scene lay before us. We were in a great natural amphitheatre, only it was three times the size of any amphitheatre ever shaped by man, and the walls were formed of precipitous cliffs, ranging from one to two hundred feet in height. For the rest, the space thus enclosed was level, studded with park-like trees, brilliant with flowers, and having a stream running through the centre of it, that, as I afterwards discovered, welled up from the ground at the head of the open space.\n\nWe spread ourselves out in a line, searching everywhere, for Tota was too overcome to be able to tell us where Stella was hidden away. For nearly half an hour we searched and searched, scanning the walls of rock for any possible openings to a cave. In vain, we could find none. I applied to old Indaba-zimbi, but his foresight was at fault here. All he could say was that this was the place, and that the \u201cStar\u201d was hidden somewhere in a cave, but where the cave was he could not tell. At last we came to the top of the amphitheatre. There before us was a wall of rock, of which the lower parts were here and there clothed in grasses, lichens, and creepers. I walked along it, calling at the top of my voice.\n\nPresently my heart stood still, for I thought I heard a faint answer. I drew nearer to the place from which the sound seemed to come, and again called. Yes, there was an answer in my wife\u2019s voice. It seemed to come from the rock. I went up to it and searched among the creepers, but still could find no opening.\n\n\u201cMove the stone,\u201d cried Stella\u2019s voice, \u201cthe cave is shut with a stone.\u201d\n\nI took a spear and prodded at the cliff whence the sound came. Suddenly the spear sunk in through a mass of lichen. I swept the lichen aside, revealing a boulder that had been rolled into the mouth of an opening in the rock, which it fitted so accurately that, covered as it was by the overhanging lichen, it might well have escaped the keenest eye. We dragged the boulder out; it was two men\u2019s work to do it. Beyond was a narrow, water-worn passage, which I followed with a beating heart. Presently the passage opened into a small cave, shaped like a pickle bottle, and coming to a neck at the top end. We passed through and found ourselves in a second, much larger cave, that I at once recognized as the one of which Indaba-zimbi had shown me a vision in the water. Light reached it from above\u2014how I know not\u2014and by it I could see a form half-sitting, half lying on some skins at the top end of the cave. I rushed to it. It was Stella! Stella bound with strips of hide, bruised, torn, but still Stella, and alive.\n\nShe saw me, she gave one cry, then, as I caught her in my arms, she fainted. It was happy indeed that she did not faint before, for had it not been for the sound of her voice I do not believe we should ever have found that cunningly hidden cave, unless, indeed, Indaba-zimbi\u2019s magic (on which be blessings) had come to our assistance."

  "Anthony Hope -- The prisoner of Zenda": [
    "\u201cI wonder when in the world you\u2019re going to do anything, Rudolf?\u201d said my brother\u2019s wife.\n\u201cMy dear Rose,\u201d I answered, laying down my egg-spoon, \u201cwhy in the world should I do anything? My position is a comfortable one. I have an income nearly sufficient for my wants (no one\u2019s income is ever quite sufficient, you know), I enjoy an enviable social position: I am brother to Lord Burlesdon, and brother-in-law to that charming lady, his countess. Behold, it is enough!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are nine-and-twenty,\u201d she observed, \u201cand you\u2019ve done nothing but--\u201d\n\n\u201cKnock about? It is true. Our family doesn\u2019t need to do things.\u201d\n\nThis remark of mine rather annoyed Rose, for everybody knows (and therefore there can be no harm in referring to the fact) that, pretty and accomplished as she herself is, her family is hardly of the same standing as the Rassendylls. Besides her attractions, she possessed a large fortune, and my brother Robert was wise enough not to mind about her ancestry. Ancestry is, in fact, a matter concerning which the next observation of Rose\u2019s has some truth.\n\n\u201cGood families are generally worse than any others,\u201d she said.\n\nUpon this I stroked my hair: I knew quite well what she meant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad Robert\u2019s is black!\u201d she cried.\n\nAt this moment Robert (who rises at seven and works before breakfast) came in. He glanced at his wife: her cheek was slightly flushed; he patted it caressingly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, my dear?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cShe objects to my doing nothing and having red hair,\u201d said I, in an injured tone.\n\n\u201cOh! of course he can\u2019t help his hair,\u201d admitted Rose.\n\n\u201cIt generally crops out once in a generation,\u201d said my brother. \u201cSo does the nose. Rudolf has got them both.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish they didn\u2019t crop out,\u201d said Rose, still flushed.\n\n\u201cI rather like them myself,\u201d said I, and, rising, I bowed to the portrait of Countess Amelia.\n\nMy brother\u2019s wife uttered an exclamation of impatience.\n\n\u201cI wish you\u2019d take that picture away, Robert,\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cMy dear!\u201d he cried.\n\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I added.\n\n\u201cThen it might be forgotten,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cHardly--with Rudolf about,\u201d said Robert, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cWhy should it be forgotten?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cRudolf!\u201d exclaimed my brother\u2019s wife, blushing very prettily.\n\nI laughed, and went on with my egg. At least I had shelved the question of what (if anything) I ought to do. And, by way of closing the discussion--and also, I must admit, of exasperating my strict little sister-in-law a trifle more--I observed:\n\n\u201cI rather like being an Elphberg myself.\u201d\n\n\nWhen I read a story, I skip the explanations; yet the moment I begin to write one, I find that I must have an explanation. For it is manifest that I must explain why my sister-in-law was vexed with my nose and hair, and why I ventured to call myself an Elphberg. For eminent as, I must protest, the Rassendylls have been for many generations, yet participation in their blood of course does not, at first sight, justify the boast of a connection with the grander stock of the Elphbergs or a claim to be one of that Royal House. For what relationship is there between Ruritania and Burlesdon, between the Palace at Strelsau or the Castle of Zenda and Number 305 Park Lane, W.?\n\nWell then--and I must premise that I am going, perforce, to rake up the very scandal which my dear Lady Burlesdon wishes forgotten--in the year 1733, George II. sitting then on the throne, peace reigning for the moment, and the King and the Prince of Wales being not yet at loggerheads, there came on a visit to the English Court a certain prince, who was afterwards known to history as Rudolf the Third of Ruritania. The prince was a tall, handsome young fellow, marked (maybe marred, it is not for me to say) by a somewhat unusually long, sharp and straight nose, and a mass of dark-red hair--in fact, the nose and the hair which have stamped the Elphbergs time out of mind. He stayed some months in England, where he was most courteously received; yet, in the end, he left rather under a cloud. For he fought a duel (it was considered highly well bred of him to waive all question of his rank) with a nobleman, well known in the society of the day, not only for his own merits, but as the husband of a very beautiful wife. In that duel Prince Rudolf received a severe wound, and, recovering therefrom, was adroitly smuggled off by the Ruritanian ambassador, who had found him a pretty handful. The nobleman was not wounded in the duel; but the morning being raw and damp on the occasion of the meeting, he contracted a severe chill, and, failing to throw it off, he died some six months after the departure of Prince Rudolf, without having found leisure to adjust his relations with his wife--who, after another two months, bore an heir to the title and estates of the family of Burlesdon. This lady was the Countess Amelia, whose picture my sister-in-law wished to remove from the drawing-room in Park Lane; and her husband was James, fifth Earl of Burlesdon and twenty-second Baron Rassendyll, both in the peerage of England, and a Knight of the Garter. As for Rudolf, he went back to Ruritania, married a wife, and ascended the throne, whereon his progeny in the direct line have sat from then till this very hour--with one short interval. And, finally, if you walk through the picture galleries at Burlesdon, among the fifty portraits or so of the last century and a half, you will find five or six, including that of the sixth earl, distinguished by long, sharp, straight noses and a quantity of dark-red hair; these five or six have also blue eyes, whereas among the Rassendylls dark eyes are the commoner.\n\n\nThat is the explanation, and I am glad to have finished it: the blemishes on honourable lineage are a delicate subject, and certainly this heredity we hear so much about is the finest scandalmonger in the world; it laughs at discretion, and writes strange entries between the lines of the \u201cPeerages\u201d.\n\nIt will be observed that my sister-in-law, with a want of logic that must have been peculiar to herself (since we are no longer allowed to lay it to the charge of her sex), treated my complexion almost as an offence for which I was responsible, hastening to assume from that external sign inward qualities of which I protest my entire innocence; and this unjust inference she sought to buttress by pointing to the uselessness of the life I had led. Well, be that as it may, I had picked up a good deal of pleasure and a good deal of knowledge. I had been to a German school and a German university, and spoke German as readily and perfectly as English; I was thoroughly at home in French; I had a smattering of Italian and enough Spanish to swear by. I was, I believe, a strong, though hardly fine swordsman and a good shot. I could ride anything that had a back to sit on; and my head was as cool a one as you could find, for all its flaming cover. If you say that I ought to have spent my time in useful labour, I am out of Court and have nothing to say, save that my parents had no business to leave me two thousand pounds a year and a roving disposition.\n\n\u201cThe difference between you and Robert,\u201d said my sister-in-law, who often (bless her!) speaks on a platform, and oftener still as if she were on one, \u201cis that he recognizes the duties of his position, and you see the opportunities of yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo a man of spirit, my dear Rose,\u201d I answered, \u201copportunities are duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d said she, tossing her head; and after a moment she went on: \u201cNow, here\u2019s Sir Jacob Borrodaile offering you exactly what you might be equal to.\u201d\n\n\u201cA thousand thanks!\u201d I murmured.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s to have an Embassy in six months, and Robert says he is sure that he\u2019ll take you as an attach\u00e9. Do take it, Rudolf--to please me.\u201d\n\nNow, when my sister-in-law puts the matter in that way, wrinkling her pretty brows, twisting her little hands, and growing wistful in the eyes, all on account of an idle scamp like myself, for whom she has no natural responsibility, I am visited with compunction. Moreover, I thought it possible that I could pass the time in the position suggested with some tolerable amusement. Therefore I said:\n\n\u201cMy dear sister, if in six months\u2019 time no unforeseen obstacle has arisen, and Sir Jacob invites me, hang me if I don\u2019t go with Sir Jacob!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Rudolf, how good of you! I am glad!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s he going to?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know yet; but it\u2019s sure to be a good Embassy.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame,\u201d said I, \u201cfor your sake I\u2019ll go, if it\u2019s no more than a beggarly Legation. When I do a thing, I don\u2019t do it by halves.\u201d\n\n\nMy promise, then, was given; but six months are six months, and seem an eternity, and, inasmuch as they stretched between me and my prospective industry (I suppose attach\u00e9s are industrious; but I know not, for I never became attach\u00e9 to Sir Jacob or anybody else), I cast about for some desirable mode of spending them. And it occurred to me suddenly that I would visit Ruritania. It may seem strange that I had never visited that country yet; but my father (in spite of a sneaking fondness for the Elphbergs, which led him to give me, his second son, the famous Elphberg name of Rudolf) had always been averse from my going, and, since his death, my brother, prompted by Rose, had accepted the family tradition which taught that a wide berth was to be given to that country. But the moment Ruritania had come into my head I was eaten up with a curiosity to see it. After all, red hair and long noses are not confined to the House of Elphberg, and the old story seemed a preposterously insufficient reason for debarring myself from acquaintance with a highly interesting and important kingdom, one which had played no small part in European history, and might do the like again under the sway of a young and vigorous ruler, such as the new King was rumoured to be. My determination was clinched by reading in *The Times* that Rudolf the Fifth was to be crowned at Strelsau in the course of the next three weeks, and that great magnificence was to mark the occasion. At once I made up my mind to be present, and began my preparations. But, inasmuch as it has never been my practice to furnish my relatives with an itinerary of my journeys and in this case I anticipated opposition to my wishes, I gave out that I was going for a ramble in the Tyrol--an old haunt of mine--and propitiated Rose\u2019s wrath by declaring that I intended to study the political and social problems of the interesting community which dwells in that neighbourhood.\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I hinted darkly, \u201cthere may be an outcome of the expedition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said I carelessly, \u201cthere seems a gap that might be filled by an exhaustive work on--\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! will you write a book?\u201d she cried, clapping her hands. \u201cThat would be splendid, wouldn\u2019t it, Robert?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best of introductions to political life nowadays,\u201d observed my brother, who has, by the way, introduced himself in this manner several times over. *Burlesdon on Ancient Theories and Modern Facts* and *The Ultimate Outcome, by a Political Student*, are both works of recognized eminence.\n\n\u201cI believe you are right, Bob, my boy,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cNow promise you\u2019ll do it,\u201d said Rose earnestly.\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t promise; but if I find enough material, I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair enough,\u201d said Robert.\n\n\u201cOh, material doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d she said, pouting.\n\nBut this time she could get no more than a qualified promise out of me. To tell the truth, I would have wagered a handsome sum that the story of my expedition that summer would stain no paper and spoil not a single pen. And that shows how little we know what the future holds; for here I am, fulfilling my qualified promise, and writing, as I never thought to write, a book--though it will hardly serve as an introduction to political life, and has not a jot to do with the Tyrol.\n\nNeither would it, I fear, please Lady Burlesdon, if I were to submit it to her critical eye--a step which I have no intention of taking.",
    "Of what followed next I remember nothing. I knelt before the altar and the Cardinal anointed my head. Then I rose to my feet, and stretched out my hand and took from him the crown of Ruritania and set it on my head, and I swore the old oath of the King; and (if it were a sin, may it be forgiven me) I received the Holy Sacrament there before them all. Then the great organ pealed out again, the Marshal bade the heralds proclaim me, and Rudolf the Fifth was crowned King; of which imposing ceremony an excellent picture hangs now in my dining-room. The portrait of the King is very good.\n\nThen the lady with the pale face and the glorious hair, her train held by two pages, stepped from her place and came to where I stood. And a herald cried:\n\n\u201cHer Royal Highness the Princess Flavia!\u201d\n\nShe curtsied low, and put her hand under mine and raised my hand and kissed it. And for an instant I thought what I had best do. Then I drew her to me and kissed her twice on the cheek, and she blushed red, and--then his Eminence the Cardinal Archbishop slipped in front of Black Michael, and kissed my hand and presented me with a letter from the Pope--the first and last which I have received from that exalted quarter!\n\n\nAnd then came the Duke of Strelsau. His step trembled, I swear, and he looked to the right and to the left, as a man looks who thinks on flight; and his face was patched with red and white, and his hand shook so that it jumped under mine, and I felt his lips dry and parched. And I glanced at Sapt, who was smiling again into his beard, and, resolutely doing my duty in that station of life to which I had been marvellously called, I took my dear Michael by both hands and kissed him on the cheek. I think we were both glad when that was over!\n\nBut neither in the face of the princess nor in that of any other did I see the least doubt or questioning. Yet, had I and the King stood side by side, she could have told us in an instant, or, at least, on a little consideration. But neither she nor anyone else dreamed or imagined that I could be other than the King. So the likeness served, and for an hour I stood there, feeling as weary and blase as though I had been a king all my life; and everybody kissed my hand, and the ambassadors paid me their respects, among them old Lord Topham, at whose house in Grosvenor Square I had danced a score of times. Thank heaven, the old man was as blind as a bat, and did not claim my acquaintance.\n\nThen back we went through the streets to the Palace, and I heard them cheering Black Michael; but he, Fritz told me, sat biting his nails like a man in a reverie, and even his own friends said that he should have made a braver show. I was in a carriage now, side by side with the Princess Flavia, and a rough fellow cried out:\n\n\u201cAnd when\u2019s the wedding?\u201d and as he spoke another struck him in the face, crying \u201cLong live Duke Michael!\u201d and the princess coloured--it was an admirable tint--and looked straight in front of her.\n\nNow I felt in a difficulty, because I had forgotten to ask Sapt the state of my affections, or how far matters had gone between the princess and myself. Frankly, had I been the King, the further they had gone the better should I have been pleased. For I am not a slow-blooded man, and I had not kissed Princess Flavia\u2019s cheek for nothing. These thoughts passed through my head, but, not being sure of my ground, I said nothing; and in a moment or two the princess, recovering her equanimity, turned to me.\n\n\u201cDo you know, Rudolf,\u201d said she, \u201cyou look somehow different today?\u201d\n\nThe fact was not surprising, but the remark was disquieting.\n\n\u201cYou look,\u201d she went on, \u201cmore sober, more sedate; you\u2019re almost careworn, and I declare you\u2019re thinner. Surely it\u2019s not possible that you\u2019ve begun to take anything seriously?\u201d\n\nThe princess seemed to hold of the King much the same opinion that Lady Burlesdon held of me.\n\nI braced myself up to the conversation.\n\n\u201cWould that please you?\u201d I asked softly.\n\n\u201cOh, you know my views,\u201d said she, turning her eyes away.\n\n\u201cWhatever pleases you I try to do,\u201d I said; and, as I saw her smile and blush, I thought that I was playing the King\u2019s hand very well for him. So I continued and what I said was perfectly true:\n\n\u201cI assure you, my dear cousin, that nothing in my life has affected me more than the reception I\u2019ve been greeted with today.\u201d\n\nShe smiled brightly, but in an instant grew grave again, and whispered:\n\n\u201cDid you notice Michael?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said I, adding, \u201che wasn\u2019t enjoying himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo be careful!\u201d she went on. \u201cYou don\u2019t--indeed you don\u2019t--keep enough watch on him. You know--\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said I, \u201cthat he wants what I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Hush!\u201d\n\nThen--and I can\u2019t justify it, for I committed the King far beyond what I had a right to do--I suppose she carried me off my feet--I went on:\n\n\u201cAnd perhaps also something which I haven\u2019t got yet, but hope to win some day.\u201d\n\nThis was her answer. Had I been the King, I should have thought it encouraging:\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you enough responsibilities on you for one day, cousin?\u201d\n\nBang, bang! Blare, blare! We were at the Palace. Guns were firing and trumpets blowing. Rows of lackeys stood waiting, and, handing the princess up the broad marble staircase, I took formal possession, as a crowned King, of the House of my ancestors, and sat down at my own table, with my cousin on my right hand, on her other side Black Michael, and on my left his Eminence the Cardinal. Behind my chair stood Sapt; and at the end of the table, I saw Fritz von Tarlenheim drain to the bottom his glass of champagne rather sooner than he decently should.\n\nI wondered what the King of Ruritania was doing.",
    "Once, however, outside the city, we ran little danger, for everybody else was inside, merry-making; and as the evening fell we quickened our pace, my splendid horse bounding along under me as though I had been a feather. It was a fine night, and presently the moon appeared. We talked little on the way, and chiefly about the progress we were making.\n\n\u201cI wonder what the duke\u2019s despatches told him,\u201d said I, once.\n\n\u201cAy, I wonder!\u201d responded Sapt.\n\nWe stopped for a draught of wine and to bait our horses, losing half an hour thus. I dared not go into the inn, and stayed with the horses in the stable. Then we went ahead again, and had covered some five-and-twenty miles, when Sapt abruptly stopped.\n\n\u201cHark!\u201d he cried.\n\nI listened. Away, far behind us, in the still of the evening--it was just half-past nine--we heard the beat of horses\u2019 hoofs. The wind blowing strong behind us, carried the sound. I glanced at Sapt.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d he cried, and spurred his horse into a gallop. When we next paused to listen, the hoof-beats were not audible, and we relaxed our pace. Then we heard them again. Sapt jumped down and laid his ear to the ground.\n\n\u201cThere are two,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re only a mile behind. Thank God the road curves in and out, and the wind\u2019s our way.\u201d\n\nWe galloped on. We seemed to be holding our own. We had entered the outskirts of the forest of Zenda, and the trees, closing in behind us as the track zigged and zagged, prevented us seeing our pursuers, and them from seeing us.\n\nAnother half-hour brought us to a divide of the road. Sapt drew rein.\n\n\u201cTo the right is our road,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the left, to the Castle. Each about eight miles. Get down.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019ll be on us!\u201d I cried.\n\n\u201cGet down!\u201d he repeated brusquely; and I obeyed. The wood was dense up to the very edge of the road. We led our horses into the covert, bound handkerchiefs over their eyes, and stood beside them.\n\n\u201cYou want to see who they are?\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cAy, and where they\u2019re going,\u201d he answered.\n\nI saw that his revolver was in his hand.\n\nNearer and nearer came the hoofs. The moon shone out now clear and full, so that the road was white with it. The ground was hard, and we had left no traces.\n\n\u201cHere they come!\u201d whispered Sapt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the duke!\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d he answered.\n\nIt was the duke; and with him a burly fellow whom I knew well, and who had cause to know me afterwards--Max Holf, brother to Johann the keeper, and body-servant to his Highness. They were up to us: the duke reined up. I saw Sapt\u2019s finger curl lovingly towards the trigger. I believe he would have given ten years of his life for a shot; and he could have picked off Black Michael as easily as I could a barn-door fowl in a farmyard. I laid my hand on his arm. He nodded reassuringly: he was always ready to sacrifice inclination to duty.\n\n\u201cWhich way?\u201d asked Black Michael.\n\n\u201cTo the Castle, your Highness,\u201d urged his companion. \u201cThere we shall learn the truth.\u201d\n\nFor an instant the duke hesitated.\n\n\u201cI thought I heard hoofs,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cI think not, your Highness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we go to the lodge?\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear a trap. If all is well, why go to the lodge? If not, it\u2019s a snare to trap us.\u201d\n\nSuddenly the duke\u2019s horse neighed. In an instant we folded our cloaks close round our horses\u2019 heads, and, holding them thus, covered the duke and his attendant with our revolvers. If they had found us, they had been dead men, or our prisoners.\n\nMichael waited a moment longer. Then he cried:\n\n\u201cTo Zenda, then!\u201d and setting spurs to his horse, galloped on.\n\nSapt raised his weapon after him, and there was such an expression of wistful regret on his face that I had much ado not to burst out laughing.\n\nFor ten minutes we stayed where we were.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Sapt, \u201cthey\u2019ve sent him news that all is well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cGod knows,\u201d said Sapt, frowning heavily. \u201cBut it\u2019s brought him from Strelsau in a rare puzzle.\u201d\n\nThen we mounted, and rode as fast as our weary horses could lay their feet to the ground. For those last eight miles we spoke no more. Our minds were full of apprehension. \u201cAll is well.\u201d What did it mean? Was all well with the King?\n\nAt last the lodge came in sight. Spurring our horses to a last gallop, we rode up to the gate. All was still and quiet. Not a soul came to meet us. We dismounted in haste. Suddenly Sapt caught me by the arm.\n\n\u201cLook there!\u201d he said, pointing to the ground.\n\nI looked down. At my feet lay five or six silk handkerchiefs, torn and slashed and rent. I turned to him questioningly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re what I tied the old woman up with,\u201d said he. \u201cFasten the horses, and come along.\u201d\n\nThe handle of the door turned without resistance. We passed into the room which had been the scene of last night\u2019s bout. It was still strewn with the remnants of our meal and with empty bottles.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d cried Sapt, whose marvellous composure had at last almost given way.\n\nWe rushed down the passage towards the cellars. The door of the coal-cellar stood wide open.\n\n\u201cThey found the old woman,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cYou might have known that from the handkerchiefs,\u201d he said.\n\nThen we came opposite the door of the wine-cellar. It was shut. It looked in all respects as it had looked when we left it that morning.\n\n\u201cCome, it\u2019s all right,\u201d said I.\n\nA loud oath from Sapt rang out. His face turned pale, and he pointed again at the floor. From under the door a red stain had spread over the floor of the passage and dried there. Sapt sank against the opposite wall. I tried the door. It was locked.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Josef?\u201d muttered Sapt.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the King?\u201d I responded.",
    "I came to the door of the cellar. The red stain turning more and more to a dull brown, stretched inside. I walked two yards into the cellar, and held the candle high above my head. I saw the full bins of wine; I saw spiders crawling on the walls; I saw, too, a couple of empty bottles lying on the floor; and then, away in the corner, I saw the body of a man, lying flat on his back, with his arms stretched wide, and a crimson gash across his throat. I walked to him and knelt down beside him, and commended to God the soul of a faithful man. For it was the body of Josef, the little servant, slain in guarding the King.\n\nI felt a hand on my shoulders, and, turning, saw Sapt, eyes glaring and terror-struck, beside me.\n\n\u201cThe King? My God! the King?\u201d he whispered hoarsely.\n\nI threw the candle\u2019s gleam over every inch of the cellar.\n\n\u201cThe King is not here,\u201d said I.\n\n\nI put my arm round Sapt\u2019s waist and supported him out of the cellar, drawing the battered door close after me. For ten minutes or more we sat silent in the dining-room. Then old Sapt rubbed his knuckles into his eyes, gave one great gasp, and was himself again. As the clock on the mantelpiece struck one he stamped his foot on the floor, saying:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got the King!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said I, \u201c\u2018all\u2019s well!\u2019 as Black Michael\u2019s despatch said. What a moment it must have been for him when the royal salutes fired at Strelsau this morning! I wonder when he got the message?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must have been sent in the morning,\u201d said Sapt. \u201cThey must have sent it before news of your arrival at Strelsau reached Zenda--I suppose it came from Zenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s carried it about all day!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cUpon my honour, I\u2019m not the only man who\u2019s had a trying day! What did he think, Sapt?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that matter? What does he think, lad, now?\u201d\n\nI rose to my feet.\n\n\u201cWe must get back,\u201d I said, \u201cand rouse every soldier in Strelsau. We ought to be in pursuit of Michael before midday.\u201d\n\nOld Sapt pulled out his pipe and carefully lit it from the candle which guttered on the table.\n\n\u201cThe King may be murdered while we sit here!\u201d I urged.\n\nSapt smoked on for a moment in silence.\n\n\u201cThat cursed old woman!\u201d he broke out. \u201cShe must have attracted their attention somehow. I see the game. They came up to kidnap the King, and--as I say--somehow they found him. If you hadn\u2019t gone to Strelsau, you and I and Fritz had been in heaven by now!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the King?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho knows where the King is now?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cCome, let\u2019s be off!\u201d said I; but he sat still. And suddenly he burst into one of his grating chuckles:\n\n\u201cBy Jove, we\u2019ve shaken up Black Michael!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, come!\u201d I repeated impatiently.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll shake him up a bit more,\u201d he added, a cunning smile broadening on his wrinkled, weather-beaten face, and his teeth working on an end of his grizzled moustache. \u201cAy, lad, we\u2019ll go back to Strelsau. The King shall be in his capital again tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe King?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crowned King!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad!\u201d I cried.\n\n\u201cIf we go back and tell the trick we played, what would you give for our lives?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust what they\u2019re worth,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cAnd for the King\u2019s throne? Do you think that the nobles and the people will enjoy being fooled as you\u2019ve fooled them? Do you think they\u2019ll love a King who was too drunk to be crowned, and sent a servant to personate him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was drugged--and I\u2019m no servant.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine will be Black Michael\u2019s version.\u201d\n\nHe rose, came to me, and laid his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\u201cLad,\u201d he said, \u201cif you play the man, you may save the King yet. Go back and keep his throne warm for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the duke knows--the villains he has employed know--\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, but they can\u2019t speak!\u201d roared Sapt in grim triumph. \u201cWe\u2019ve got \u2019em! How can they denounce you without denouncing themselves? This is not the King, because we kidnapped the King and murdered his servant. Can they say that?\u201d\n\nThe position flashed on me. Whether Michael knew me or not, he could not speak. Unless he produced the King, what could he do? And if he produced the King, where was he? For a moment I was carried away headlong; but in an instant the difficulties came strong upon me.\n\n\u201cI must be found out,\u201d I urged.\n\n\u201cPerhaps; but every hour\u2019s something. Above all, we must have a King in Strelsau, or the city will be Michael\u2019s in four-and-twenty hours, and what would the King\u2019s life be worth then--or his throne? Lad, you must do it!\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose they kill the King?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll kill him, if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cSapt, suppose they have killed the King?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, by heaven, you\u2019re as good an Elphberg as Black Michael, and you shall reign in Ruritania! But I don\u2019t believe they have; nor will they kill him if you\u2019re on the throne. Will they kill him, to put you in?\u201d\n\nIt was a wild plan--wilder even and more hopeless than the trick we had already carried through; but as I listened to Sapt I saw the strong points in our game. And then I was a young man and I loved action, and I was offered such a hand in such a game as perhaps never man played yet.\n\n\u201cI shall be found out,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Sapt. \u201cCome! to Strelsau! We shall be caught like rats in a trap if we stay here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSapt,\u201d I cried, \u201cI\u2019ll try it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell played!\u201d said he. \u201cI hope they\u2019ve left us the horses. I\u2019ll go and see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must bury that poor fellow,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cNo time,\u201d said Sapt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang you!\u201d he grinned. \u201cI make you a King, and--Well, do it. Go and fetch him, while I look to the horses. He can\u2019t lie very deep, but I doubt if he\u2019ll care about that. Poor little Josef! He was an honest bit of a man.\u201d\n\nHe went out, and I went to the cellar. I raised poor Josef in my arms and bore him into the passage and thence towards the door of the house. Just inside I laid him down, remembering that I must find spades for our task. At this instant Sapt came up.\n\n\u201cThe horses are all right; there\u2019s the own brother to the one that brought you here. But you may save yourself that job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll not go before he\u2019s buried.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you will.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot I, Colonel Sapt; not for all Ruritania.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fool!\u201d said he. \u201cCome here.\u201d\n\nHe drew me to the door. The moon was sinking, but about three hundred yards away, coming along the road from Zenda, I made out a party of men. There were seven or eight of them; four were on horseback and the rest were walking, and I saw that they carried long implements, which I guessed to be spades and mattocks, on their shoulders.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll save you the trouble,\u201d said Sapt. \u201cCome along.\u201d\n\nHe was right. The approaching party must, beyond doubt, be Duke Michael\u2019s men, come to remove the traces of their evil work. I hesitated no longer, but an irresistible desire seized me.\n\nPointing to the corpse of poor little Josef, I said to Sapt:\n\n\u201cColonel, we ought to strike a blow for him!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to give him some company, eh! But it\u2019s too risky work, your Majesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must have a slap at \u2019em,\u201d said I.\n\nSapt wavered.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cit\u2019s not business, you know; but you\u2019ve been a good boy--and if we come to grief, why, hang me, it\u2019ll save us lot of thinking! I\u2019ll show you how to touch them.\u201d",
    "The ball was a sumptuous affair. I opened it by dancing a quadrille with Flavia: then I waltzed with her. Curious eyes and eager whispers attended us. We went in to supper; and, half way through, I, half mad by then, for her glance had answered mine, and her quick breathing met my stammered sentences--I rose in my place before all the brilliant crowd, and taking the Red Rose that I wore, flung the ribbon with its jewelled badge round her neck. In a tumult of applause I sat down: I saw Sapt smiling over his wine, and Fritz frowning. The rest of the meal passed in silence; neither Flavia nor I could speak. Fritz touched me on the shoulder, and I rose, gave her my arm, and walked down the hall into a little room, where coffee was served to us. The gentlemen and ladies in attendance withdrew, and we were alone.\n\nThe little room had French windows opening on the gardens. The night was fine, cool, and fragrant. Flavia sat down, and I stood opposite her. I was struggling with myself: if she had not looked at me, I believe that even then I should have won my fight. But suddenly, involuntarily, she gave me one brief glance--a glance of question, hurriedly turned aside; a blush that the question had ever come spread over her cheek, and she caught her breath. Ah, if you had seen her! I forgot the King in Zenda. I forgot the King in Strelsau. She was a princess--and I an impostor. Do you think I remembered that? I threw myself on my knee and seized her hands in mine. I said nothing. Why should I? The soft sounds of the night set my wooing to a wordless melody, as I pressed my kisses on her lips.\n\nShe pushed me from her, crying suddenly:\n\n\u201cAh! is it true? or is it only because you must?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d I said, in low smothered tones--\u201ctrue that I love you more than life--or truth--or honour!\u201d\n\nShe set no meaning to my words, treating them as one of love\u2019s sweet extravagances. She came close to me, and whispered:\n\n\u201cOh, if you were not the King! Then I could show you how I love you! How is it that I love you now, Rudolf?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes--just lately. I--I never did before.\u201d\n\nPure triumph filled me. It was I--Rudolf Rassendyll--who had won her! I caught her round the waist.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t love me before?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe looked up into my face, smiling, as she whispered:\n\n\u201cIt must have been your Crown. I felt it first on the Coronation Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever before?\u201d I asked eagerly.\n\nShe laughed low.\n\n\u201cYou speak as if you would be pleased to hear me say \u2018Yes\u2019 to that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWould \u2018Yes\u2019 be true?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I just heard her breathe, and she went on in an instant: \u201cBe careful, Rudolf; be careful, dear. He will be mad now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, Michael? If Michael were the worst--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat worse is there?\u201d\n\nThere was yet a chance for me. Controlling myself with a mighty effort, I took my hands off her and stood a yard or two away. I remember now the note of the wind in the elm trees outside.\n\n\u201cIf I were not the King,\u201d I began, \u201cif I were only a private gentleman--\u201d\n\nBefore I could finish, her hand was in mine.\n\n\u201cIf you were a convict in the prison of Strelsau, you would be my King,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd under my breath I groaned, \u201cGod forgive me!\u201d and, holding her hand in mine, I said again:\n\n\u201cIf I were not the King--\u201d\n\n\u201cHush, hush!\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve it--I don\u2019t deserve to be doubted. Ah, Rudolf! does a woman who marries without love look on the man as I look on you?\u201d\n\nAnd she hid her face from me.\n\nFor more than a minute we stood there together; and I, even with my arm about her, summoned up what honour and conscience her beauty and the toils that I was in had left me.\n\n\u201cFlavia,\u201d I said, in a strange dry voice that seemed not my own, \u201cI am not--\u201d\n\nAs I spoke--as she raised her eyes to me--there was a heavy step on the gravel outside, and a man appeared at the window. A little cry burst from Flavia, as she sprang back from me. My half-finished sentence died on my lips. Sapt stood there, bowing low, but with a stern frown on his face.\n\n\u201cA thousand pardons, sire,\u201d said he, \u201cbut his Eminence the Cardinal has waited this quarter of an hour to offer his respectful adieu to your Majesty.\u201d\n\nI met his eye full and square; and I read in it an angry warning. How long he had been a listener I knew not, but he had come in upon us in the nick of time.\n\n\u201cWe must not keep his Eminence waiting,\u201d said I.\n\nBut Flavia, in whose love there lay no shame, with radiant eyes and blushing face, held out her hand to Sapt. She said nothing, but no man could have missed her meaning, who had ever seen a woman in the exultation of love. A sour, yet sad, smile passed over the old soldier\u2019s face, and there was tenderness in his voice, as bending to kiss her hand, he said:\n\n\u201cIn joy and sorrow, in good times and bad, God save your Royal Highness!\u201d\n\nHe paused and added, glancing at me and drawing himself up to military erectness:\n\n\u201cBut, before all comes the King--God save the King!\u201d\n\nAnd Flavia caught at my hand and kissed it, murmuring:\n\n\u201cAmen! Good God, Amen!\u201d\n\nWe went into the ballroom again. Forced to receive adieus, I was separated from Flavia: everyone, when they left me, went to her. Sapt was out and in of the throng, and where he had been, glances, smiles, and whispers were rife. I doubted not that, true to his relentless purpose, he was spreading the news that he had learnt. To uphold the Crown and beat Black Michael--that was his one resolve. Flavia, myself--ay, and the real King in Zenda, were pieces in his game; and pawns have no business with passions. Not even at the walls of the Palace did he stop; for when at last I handed Flavia down the broad marble steps and into her carriage, there was a great crowd awaiting us, and we were welcomed with deafening cheers. What could I do? Had I spoken then, they would have refused to believe that I was not the King; they might have believed that the King had run mad. By Sapt\u2019s devices and my own ungoverned passion I had been forced on, and the way back had closed behind me; and the passion still drove me in the same direction as the devices seduced me. I faced all Strelsau that night as the King and the accepted suitor of the Princess Flavia.",
    "The Marshal received me with most loyal kindness. To some extent, I took him into my confidence. I charged him with the care of the princess, looking him full and significantly in the face as I bade him let no one from her cousin the duke approach her, unless he himself were there and a dozen of his men with him.\n\n\u201cYou may be right, sire,\u201d said he, shaking his grey head sadly. \u201cI have known better men than the duke do worse things than that for love.\u201d\n\nI could quite appreciate the remark, but I said:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something beside love, Marshal. Love\u2019s for the heart; is there nothing my brother might like for his head?\u201d\n\n\u201cI pray that you wrong him, sire.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarshal, I\u2019m leaving Strelsau for a few days. Every evening I will send a courier to you. If for three days none comes, you will publish an order which I will give you, depriving Duke Michael of the governorship of Strelsau and appointing you in his place. You will declare a state of siege. Then you will send word to Michael that you demand an audience of the King--You follow me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, sire.\u201d\n\n\u201c--In twenty-four hours. If he does not produce the King\u201d (I laid my hand on his knee), \u201cthen the King is dead, and you will proclaim the next heir. You know who that is?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Princess Flavia.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd swear to me, on your faith and honour and by the fear of the living God, that you will stand by her to the death, and kill that reptile, and seat her where I sit now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn my faith and honour, and by the fear of God, I swear it! And may Almighty God preserve your Majesty, for I think that you go on an errand of danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that no life more precious than mine may be demanded,\u201d said I, rising. Then I held out my hand to him.\n\n\u201cMarshal,\u201d I said, \u201cin days to come, it may be--I know not--that you will hear strange things of the man who speaks to you now. Let him be what he may, and who he may, what say you of the manner in which he has borne himself as King in Strelsau?\u201d\n\nThe old man, holding my hand, spoke to me, man to man.\n\n\u201cI have known many of the Elphbergs,\u201d said he, \u201cand I have seen you. And, happen what may, you have borne yourself as a wise King and a brave man; ay, and you have proved as courteous a gentleman and as gallant a lover as any that have been of the House.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe that my epitaph,\u201d said I, \u201cwhen the time comes that another sits on the throne of Ruritania.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod send a far day, and may I not see it!\u201d said he.\n\nI was much moved, and the Marshal\u2019s worn face twitched. I sat down and wrote my order.\n\n\u201cI can hardly yet write,\u201d said I; \u201cmy finger is stiff still.\u201d\n\nIt was, in fact, the first time that I had ventured to write more than a signature; and in spite of the pains I had taken to learn the King\u2019s hand, I was not yet perfect in it.\n\n\u201cIndeed, sire,\u201d he said, \u201cit differs a little from your ordinary handwriting. It is unfortunate, for it may lead to a suspicion of forgery.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarshal,\u201d said I, with a laugh, \u201cwhat use are the guns of Strelsau, if they can\u2019t assuage a little suspicion?\u201d\n\nHe smiled grimly, and took the paper.\n\n\u201cColonel Sapt and Fritz von Tarlenheim go with me,\u201d I continued.\n\n\u201cYou go to seek the duke?\u201d he asked in a low tone.\n\n\u201cYes, the duke, and someone else of whom I have need, and who is at Zenda,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cI wish I could go with you,\u201d he cried, tugging at his white moustache. \u201cI\u2019d like to strike a blow for you and your crown.\u201d\n\n\u201cI leave you what is more than my life and more than my crown,\u201d said I, \u201cbecause you are the man I trust more than all other in Ruritania.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will deliver her to you safe and sound,\u201d said he, \u201cand, failing that, I will make her queen.\u201d\n\nWe parted, and I returned to the Palace and told Sapt and Fritz what I had done. Sapt had a few faults to find and a few grumbles to utter. This was merely what I expected, for Sapt liked to be consulted beforehand, not informed afterwards; but on the whole he approved of my plans, and his spirits rose high as the hour of action drew nearer and nearer. Fritz, too, was ready; though he, poor fellow, risked more than Sapt did, for he was a lover, and his happiness hung in the scale. Yet how I envied him! For the triumphant issue which would crown him with happiness and unite him to his mistress, the success for which we were bound to hope and strive and struggle, meant to me sorrow more certain and greater than if I were doomed to fail. He understood something of this, for when we were alone (save for old Sapt, who was smoking at the other end of the room) he passed his arm through mine, saying:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for you. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t trust you; I know you have nothing but true thoughts in your heart.\u201d\n\nBut I turned away from him, thankful that he could not see what my heart held, but only be witness to the deeds that my hands were to do.",
    "In the morning of the day after that on which I swore my oath against the Six, I gave certain orders, and then rested in greater contentment than I had known for some time. I was at work; and work, though it cannot cure love, is yet a narcotic to it; so that Sapt, who grew feverish, marvelled to see me sprawling in an armchair in the sunshine, listening to one of my friends who sang me amorous songs in a mellow voice and induced in me a pleasing melancholy. Thus was I engaged when young Rupert Hentzau, who feared neither man nor devil, and rode through the demesne--where every tree might hide a marksman, for all he knew--as though it had been the park at Strelsau, cantered up to where I lay, bowing with burlesque deference, and craving private speech with me in order to deliver a message from the Duke of Strelsau. I made all withdraw, and then he said, seating himself by me: \u201cThe King is in love, it seems?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot with life, my lord,\u201d said I, smiling.\n\n\u201cIt is well,\u201d he rejoined. \u201cCome, we are alone, Rassendyll--\u201d\n\nI rose to a sitting posture.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI was about to call one of my gentlemen to bring your horse, my lord. If you do not know how to address the King, my brother must find another messenger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy keep up the farce?\u201d he asked, negligently dusting his boot with his glove.\n\n\u201cBecause it is not finished yet; and meanwhile I\u2019ll choose my own name.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, so be it! Yet I spoke in love for you; for indeed you are a man after my own heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaving my poor honesty,\u201d said I, \u201cmaybe I am. But that I keep faith with men, and honour with women, maybe I am, my lord.\u201d\n\nHe darted a glance at me--a glance of anger.\n\n\u201cIs your mother dead?\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cAy, she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe may thank God,\u201d said I, and I heard him curse me softly. \u201cWell, what\u2019s the message?\u201d I continued.\n\nI had touched him on the raw, for all the world knew he had broken his mother\u2019s heart and flaunted his mistresses in her house; and his airy manner was gone for the moment.\n\n\u201cThe duke offers you more than I would,\u201d he growled. \u201cA halter for you, sire, was my suggestion. But he offers you safe-conduct across the frontier and a million crowns.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer your offer, my lord, if I am bound to one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou refuse?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told Michael you would;\u201d and the villain, his temper restored, gave me the sunniest of smiles. \u201cThe fact is, between ourselves,\u201d he continued, \u201cMichael doesn\u2019t understand a gentleman.\u201d\n\nI began to laugh.\n\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, well, the halter be it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you won\u2019t live to see it,\u201d I observed.\n\n\u201cHas his Majesty done me the honour to fasten a particular quarrel on me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would you were a few years older, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, God gives years, but the devil gives increase,\u201d laughed he. \u201cI can hold my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is your prisoner?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThe K--?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour prisoner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI forgot your wishes, sire. Well, he is alive.\u201d\n\nHe rose to his feet; I imitated him. Then, with a smile, he said: \u201cAnd the pretty princess? Faith, I\u2019ll wager the next Elphberg will be red enough, for all that Black Michael will be called his father.\u201d\n\nI sprang a step towards him, clenching my hand. He did not move an inch, and his lip curled in insolent amusement.\n\n\u201cGo, while your skin\u2019s whole!\u201d I muttered. He had repaid me with interest my hit about his mother.\n\nThen came the most audacious thing I have known in my life. My friends were some thirty yards away. Rupert called to a groom to bring him his horse, and dismissed the fellow with a crown. The horse stood near. I stood still, suspecting nothing. Rupert made as though to mount; then he suddenly turned to me: his left hand resting in his belt, his right outstretched: \u201cShake hands,\u201d he said.\n\nI bowed, and did as he had foreseen--I put my hands behind me. Quicker than thought, his left hand darted out at me, and a small dagger flashed in the air; he struck me in the left shoulder--had I not swerved, it had been my heart. With a cry, I staggered back. Without touching the stirrup, he leapt upon his horse and was off like an arrow, pursued by cries and revolver shots--the last as useless as the first--and I sank into my chair, bleeding profusely, as I watched the devil\u2019s brat disappear down the long avenue. My friends surrounded me, and then I fainted.\n\n\nI suppose that I was put to bed, and there lay, unconscious, or half conscious, for many hours; for it was night when I awoke to my full mind, and found Fritz beside me. I was weak and weary, but he bade me be of good cheer, saying that my wound would soon heal, and that meanwhile all had gone well, for Johann, the keeper, had fallen into the snare we had laid for him, and was even now in the house.\n\n\u201cAnd the queer thing is,\u201d pursued Fritz, \u201cthat I fancy he\u2019s not altogether sorry to find himself here. He seems to think that when Black Michael has brought off his coup, witnesses of how it was effected--saving, of course, the Six themselves--will not be at a premium.\u201d\n\nThis idea argued a shrewdness in our captive which led me to build hopes on his assistance. I ordered him to be brought in at once. Sapt conducted him, and set him in a chair by my bedside. He was sullen, and afraid; but, to say truth, after young Rupert\u2019s exploit, we also had our fears, and, if he got as far as possible from Sapt\u2019s formidable six-shooter, Sapt kept him as far as he could from me. Moreover, when he came in his hands were bound, but that I would not suffer.\n\nI need not stay to recount the safeguards and rewards we promised the fellow--all of which were honourably observed and paid, so that he lives now in prosperity (though where I may not mention); and we were the more free inasmuch as we soon learnt that he was rather a weak man than a wicked, and had acted throughout this matter more from fear of the duke and of his own brother Max than for any love of what was done. But he had persuaded all of his loyalty; and though not in their secret counsels, was yet, by his knowledge of their dispositions within the Castle, able to lay bare before us the very heart of their devices. And here, in brief, is his story:\n\nBelow the level of the ground in the Castle, approached by a flight of stone steps which abutted on the end of the drawbridge, were situated two small rooms, cut out of the rock itself. The outer of the two had no windows, but was always lighted with candles; the inner had one square window, which gave upon the moat. In the outer room there lay always, day and night, three of the Six; and the instructions of Duke Michael were, that on any attack being made on the outer room, the three were to defend the door of it so long as they could without risk to themselves. But, so soon as the door should be in danger of being forced, then Rupert Hentzau or Detchard (for one of these two was always there) should leave the others to hold it as long as they could, and himself pass into the inner room, and, without more ado, kill the King who lay there, well-treated indeed, but without weapons, and with his arms confined in fine steel chains, which did not allow him to move his elbow more than three inches from his side. Thus, before the outer door were stormed, the King would be dead. And his body? For his body would be evidence as damning as himself.\n\n\n\u201cNay, sir,\u201d said Johann, \u201chis Highness has thought of that. While the two hold the outer room, the one who has killed the King unlocks the bars in the square window (they turn on a hinge). The window now gives no light, for its mouth is choked by a great pipe of earthenware; and this pipe, which is large enough to let pass through it the body of a man, passes into the moat, coming to an end immediately above the surface of the water, so that there is no perceptible interval between water and pipe. The King being dead, his murderer swiftly ties a weight to the body, and, dragging it to the window, raises it by a pulley (for, lest the weight should prove too great, Detchard has provided one) till it is level with the mouth of the pipe. He inserts the feet in the pipe, and pushes the body down. Silently, without splash or sound, it falls into the water and thence to the bottom of the moat, which is twenty feet deep thereabouts. This done, the murderer cries loudly, \u2018All\u2019s well!\u2019 and himself slides down the pipe; and the others, if they can and the attack is not too hot, run to the inner room and, seeking a moment\u2019s delay, bar the door, and in their turn slide down. And though the King rises not from the bottom, they rise and swim round to the other side, where the orders are for men to wait them with ropes, to haul them out, and horses. And here, if things go ill, the duke will join them and seek safety by riding; but if all goes well, they will return to the Castle, and have their enemies in a trap. That, sir, is the plan of his Highness for the disposal of the King in case of need. But it is not to be used till the last; for, as we all know, he is not minded to kill the King unless he can, before or soon after, kill you also, sir. Now, sir, I have spoken the truth, as God is my witness, and I pray you to shield me from the vengeance of Duke Michael; for if, after he knows what I have done, I fall into his hands, I shall pray for one thing out of all the world--a speedy death, and that I shall not obtain from him!\u201d",
    "Ruritania is not England, or the quarrel between Duke Michael and myself could not have gone on, with the extraordinary incidents which marked it, without more public notice being directed to it. Duels were frequent among all the upper classes, and private quarrels between great men kept the old habit of spreading to their friends and dependents. Nevertheless, after the affray which I have just related, such reports began to circulate that I felt it necessary to be on my guard. The death of the gentlemen involved could not be hidden from their relatives. I issued a stern order, declaring that duelling had attained unprecedented licence (the Chancellor drew up the document for me, and very well he did it), and forbidding it save in the gravest cases. I sent a public and stately apology to Michael, and he returned a deferential and courteous reply to me; for our one point of union was--and it underlay all our differences and induced an unwilling harmony between our actions--that we could neither of us afford to throw our cards on the table. He, as well as I, was a \u201cplay-actor\u201d, and, hating one another, we combined to dupe public opinion. Unfortunately, however, the necessity for concealment involved the necessity of delay: the King might die in his prison, or even be spirited off somewhere else; it could not be helped. For a little while I was compelled to observe a truce, and my only consolation was that Flavia most warmly approved of my edict against duelling, and, when I expressed delight at having won her favour, prayed me, if her favour were any motive to me, to prohibit the practice altogether.\n\n\u201cWait till we are married,\u201d said I, smiling.\n\nNot the least peculiar result of the truce and of the secrecy which dictated it was that the town of Zenda became in the day-time--I would not have trusted far to its protection by night--a sort of neutral zone, where both parties could safely go; and I, riding down one day with Flavia and Sapt, had an encounter with an acquaintance, which presented a ludicrous side, but was at the same time embarrassing. As I rode along, I met a dignified looking person driving in a two-horsed carriage. He stopped his horses, got out, and approached me, bowing low. I recognized the Head of the Strelsau Police.\n\n\u201cYour Majesty\u2019s ordinance as to duelling is receiving our best attention,\u201d he assured me.\n\nIf the best attention involved his presence in Zenda, I determined at once to dispense with it.\n\n\u201cIs that what brings you to Zenda, Prefect?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWhy no, sire; I am here because I desired to oblige the British Ambassador.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the British Ambassador doing _dans cette gal\u00e8re_?\u201d said I, carelessly.\n\n\u201cA young countryman of his, sire--a man of some position--is missing. His friends have not heard from him for two months, and there is reason to believe that he was last seen in Zenda.\u201d\n\nFlavia was paying little attention. I dared not look at Sapt.\n\n\u201cWhat reason?\u201d\n\n\u201cA friend of his in Paris--a certain M. Featherly--has given us information which makes it possible that he came here, and the officials of the railway recollect his name on some luggage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cRassendyll, sire,\u201d he answered; and I saw that the name meant nothing to him. But, glancing at Flavia, he lowered his voice, as he went on: \u201cIt is thought that he may have followed a lady here. Has your Majesty heard of a certain Madame de Mauban?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d said I, my eye involuntarily travelling towards the Castle.\n\n\u201cShe arrived in Ruritania about the same time as this Rassendyll.\u201d\n\nI caught the Prefect\u2019s glance; he was regarding me with enquiry writ large on his face.\n\n\u201cSapt,\u201d said I, \u201cI must speak a word to the Prefect. Will you ride on a few paces with the princess?\u201d And I added to the Prefect: \u201cCome, sir, what do you mean?\u201d\n\nHe drew close to me, and I bent in the saddle.\n\n\u201cIf he were in love with the lady?\u201d he whispered. \u201cNothing has been heard of him for two months;\u201d and this time it was the eye of the Prefect which travelled towards the Castle.\n\n\u201cYes, the lady is there,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t suppose Mr. Rassendyll--is that the name?--is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe duke,\u201d he whispered, \u201cdoes not like rivals, sire.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right there,\u201d said I, with all sincerity. \u201cBut surely you hint at a very grave charge?\u201d\n\nHe spread his hands out in apology. I whispered in his ear:\n\n\u201cThis is a grave matter. Go back to Strelsau--\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, sire, if I have a clue here?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo back to Strelsau,\u201d I repeated. \u201cTell the Ambassador that you have a clue, but that you must be left alone for a week or two. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll charge myself with looking into the matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Ambassador is very pressing, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must quiet him. Come, sir; you see that if your suspicions are correct, it is an affair in which we must move with caution. We can have no scandal. Mind you return tonight.\u201d\n\nHe promised to obey me, and I rode on to rejoin my companions, a little easier in my mind. Enquiries after me must be stopped at all hazards for a week or two; and this clever official had come surprisingly near the truth. His impression might be useful some day, but if he acted on it now it might mean the worse to the King. Heartily did I curse George Featherly for not holding his tongue.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d asked Flavia, \u201chave you finished your business?\u201d\n\n\u201cMost satisfactorily,\u201d said I. \u201cCome, shall we turn round? We are almost trenching on my brother\u2019s territory.\u201d\n\nWe were, in fact, at the extreme end of the town, just where the hills begin to mount towards the Castle. We cast our eyes up, admiring the massive beauty of the old walls, and we saw a _cort\u00e8ge_ winding slowly down the hill. On it came.\n\n\u201cLet us go back,\u201d said Sapt.\n\n\u201cI should like to stay,\u201d said Flavia; and I reined my horse beside hers.\n\nWe could distinguish the approaching party now. There came first two mounted servants in black uniforms, relieved only by a silver badge. These were followed by a car drawn by four horses: on it, under a heavy pall, lay a coffin; behind it rode a man in plain black clothes, carrying his hat in his hand. Sapt uncovered, and we stood waiting, Flavia keeping by me and laying her hand on my arm.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the gentlemen killed in the quarrel, I expect,\u201d she said.\n\nI beckoned to a groom.\n\n\u201cRide and ask whom they escort,\u201d I ordered.\n\nHe rode up to the servants, and I saw him pass on to the gentleman who rode behind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Rupert of Hentzau,\u201d whispered Sapt.\n\nRupert it was, and directly afterwards, waving to the procession to stand still, Rupert trotted up to me. He was in a frock-coat, tightly buttoned, and trousers. He wore an aspect of sadness, and he bowed with profound respect. Yet suddenly he smiled, and I smiled too, for old Sapt\u2019s hand lay in his left breast-pocket, and Rupert and I both guessed what lay in the hand inside the pocket.\n\n\u201cYour Majesty asks whom we escort,\u201d said Rupert. \u201cIt is my dear friend, Albert of Lauengram.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said I, \u201cno one regrets the unfortunate affair more than I. My ordinance, which I mean to have obeyed, is witness to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Flavia softly, and I saw Rupert\u2019s eyes flash at her. Whereat I grew red; for, if I had my way, Rupert Hentzau should not have defiled her by so much as a glance. Yet he did it and dared to let admiration be seen in his look.\n\n\u201cYour Majesty\u2019s words are gracious,\u201d he said. \u201cI grieve for my friend. Yet, sire, others must soon lie as he lies now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a thing we all do well to remember, my lord,\u201d I rejoined.\n\n\u201cEven kings, sire,\u201d said Rupert, in a moralizing tone; and old Sapt swore softly by my side.\n\n\u201cIt is true,\u201d said I. \u201cHow fares my brother, my lord?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is better, sire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am rejoiced.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hopes soon to leave for Strelsau, when his health is secured.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is only convalescent then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere remain one or two small troubles,\u201d answered the insolent fellow, in the mildest tone in the world.\n\n\u201cExpress my earnest hope,\u201d said Flavia, \u201cthat they may soon cease to trouble him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Royal Highness\u2019s wish is, humbly, my own,\u201d said Rupert, with a bold glance that brought a blush to Flavia\u2019s cheek.\n\nI bowed; and Rupert, bowing lower, backed his horse and signed to his party to proceed. With a sudden impulse, I rode after him. He turned swiftly, fearing that, even in the presence of the dead and before a lady\u2019s eyes, I meant him mischief.\n\n\u201cYou fought as a brave man the other night,\u201d I said. \u201cCome, you are young, sir. If you will deliver your prisoner alive to me, you shall come to no hurt.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me with a mocking smile; but suddenly he rode nearer to me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unarmed,\u201d he said; \u201cand our old Sapt there could pick me off in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cNo, curse you!\u201d he answered. \u201cLook here, I made you a proposal from the duke once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll hear nothing from Black Michael,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cThen hear one from me.\u201d He lowered his voice to a whisper. \u201cAttack the Castle boldly. Let Sapt and Tarlenheim lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cArrange the time with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have such confidence in you, my lord!\u201d\n\n\u201cTut! I\u2019m talking business now. Sapt there and Fritz will fall; Black Michael will fall--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d\n\n\u201c--Black Michael will fall, like the dog he is; the prisoner, as you call him, will go by \u2018Jacob\u2019s Ladder\u2019--ah, you know that!--to hell! Two men will be left--I, Rupert Hentzau, and you, the King of Ruritania.\u201d\n\nHe paused, and then, in a voice that quivered with eagerness, added:\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a hand to play?--a throne and your princess! And for me, say a competence and your Majesty\u2019s gratitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cwhile you\u2019re above ground, hell wants its master!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, think it over,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, look you, it would take more than a scruple or two to keep me from yonder girl,\u201d and his evil eye flashed again at her I loved.\n\n\u201cGet out of my reach!\u201d said I; and yet in a moment I began to laugh for the very audacity of it.\n\n\u201cWould you turn against your master?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe swore at Michael for being what the offspring of a legal, though morganatic, union should not be called, and said to me in an almost confidential and apparently friendly tone:\n\n\u201cHe gets in my way, you know. He\u2019s a jealous brute! Faith, I nearly stuck a knife into him last night; he came most cursedly _mal \u00e0propos_!\u201d\n\nMy temper was well under control now; I was learning something.\n\n\u201cA lady?\u201d I asked negligently.\n\n\u201cAy, and a beauty,\u201d he nodded. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! was it at a tea-party, when some of your friends got on the wrong side of the table?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can you expect of fools like Detchard and De Gautet? I wish I\u2019d been there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the duke interferes?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Rupert meditatively, \u201cthat\u2019s hardly a fair way of putting it, perhaps. I want to interfere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she prefers the duke?\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, the silly creature! Ah, well, you think about my plan,\u201d and, with a bow, he pricked his horse and trotted after the body of his friend.",
    "The position wherein I stood does not appear very favourable to thought; yet for the next moment or two I thought profoundly. I had, I told myself, scored one point. Be Rupert Hentzau\u2019s errand what it might, and the villainy he was engaged on what it would, I had scored one point. He was on the other side of the moat from the King, and it would be by no fault of mine if ever he set foot on the same side again. I had three left to deal with: two on guard and De Gautet in his bed. Ah, if I had the keys! I would have risked everything and attacked Detchard and Bersonin before their friends could join them. But I was powerless. I must wait till the coming of my friends enticed someone to cross the bridge--someone with the keys. And I waited, as it seemed, for half an hour, really for about five minutes, before the next act in the rapid drama began.\n\nAll was still on the other side. The duke\u2019s room remained inscrutable behind its shutters. The light burnt steadily in Madame de Mauban\u2019s window. Then I heard the faintest, faintest sound: it came from behind the door which led to the drawbridge on the other side of the moat. It but just reached my ear, yet I could not be mistaken as to what it was. It was made by a key being turned very carefully and slowly. Who was turning it? And of what room was it the key? There leapt before my eyes the picture of young Rupert, with the key in one hand, his sword in the other, and an evil smile on his face. But I did not know what door it was, nor on which of his favourite pursuits young Rupert was spending the hours of that night.\n\nI was soon to be enlightened, for the next moment--before my friends could be near the chateau door--before Johann the keeper would have thought to nerve himself for his task--there was a sudden crash from the room with the lighted window. It sounded as though someone had flung down a lamp; and the window went dark and black. At the same instant a cry rang out, shrill in the night: \u201cHelp, help! Michael, help!\u201d and was followed by a shriek of utter terror.\n\nI was tingling in every nerve. I stood on the topmost step, clinging to the threshold of the gate with my right hand and holding my sword in my left. Suddenly I perceived that the gateway was broader than the bridge; there was a dark corner on the opposite side where a man could stand. I darted across and stood there. Thus placed, I commanded the path, and no man could pass between the chateau and the old Castle till he had tried conclusions with me.\n\nThere was another shriek. Then a door was flung open and clanged against the wall, and I heard the handle of a door savagely twisted.\n\n\u201cOpen the door! In God\u2019s name, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d cried a voice--the voice of Black Michael himself.\n\nHe was answered by the very words I had written in my letter.\n\n\u201cHelp, Michael--Hentzau!\u201d\n\nA fierce oath rang out from the duke, and with a loud thud he threw himself against the door. At the same moment I heard a window above my head open, and a voice cried: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d and I heard a man\u2019s hasty footsteps. I grasped my sword. If De Gautet came my way, the Six would be less by one more.\n\nThen I heard the clash of crossed swords and a tramp of feet and--I cannot tell the thing so quickly as it happened, for all seemed to come at once. There was an angry cry from madame\u2019s room, the cry of a wounded man; the window was flung open; young Rupert stood there sword in hand. He turned his back, and I saw his body go forward to the lunge.\n\n\u201cAh, Johann, there\u2019s one for you! Come on, Michael!\u201d\n\nJohann was there, then--come to the rescue of the duke! How would he open the door for me? For I feared that Rupert had slain him.\n\n\u201cHelp!\u201d cried the duke\u2019s voice, faint and husky.\n\nI heard a step on the stairs above me; and I heard a stir down to my left, in the direction of the King\u2019s cell. But, before anything happened on my side of the moat, I saw five or six men round young Rupert in the embrasure of madame\u2019s window. Three or four times he lunged with incomparable dash and dexterity. For an instant they fell back, leaving a ring round him. He leapt on the parapet of the window, laughing as he leapt, and waving his sword in his hand. He was drunk with blood, and he laughed again wildly as he flung himself headlong into the moat.\n\nWhat became of him then? I did not see: for as he leapt, De Gautet\u2019s lean face looked out through the door by me, and, without a second\u2019s hesitation, I struck at him with all the strength God had given me, and he fell dead in the doorway without a word or a groan. I dropped on my knees by him. Where were the keys? I found myself muttering: \u201cThe keys, man, the keys?\u201d as though he had been yet alive and could listen; and when I could not find them, I--God forgive me!--I believe I struck a dead man\u2019s face.\n\nAt last I had them. There were but three. Seizing the largest, I felt the lock of the door that led to the cell. I fitted in the key. It was right. The lock turned. I drew the door close behind me and locked it as noiselessly as I could, putting the key in my pocket.\n\nI found myself at the top of a flight of steep stone stairs. An oil lamp burnt dimly in the bracket. I took it down and held it in my hand; and I stood and listened.\n\n\u201cWhat in the devil can it be?\u201d I heard a voice say.\n\nIt came from behind a door that faced me at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nAnd another answered:\n\n\u201cShall we kill him?\u201d\n\nI strained to hear the answer, and could have sobbed with relief when Detchard\u2019s voice came grating and cold:\n\n\u201cWait a bit. There\u2019ll be trouble if we strike too soon.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence. Then I heard the bolt of the door cautiously drawn back. Instantly I put out the light I held, replacing the lamp in the bracket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dark--the lamp\u2019s out. Have you a light?\u201d said the other voice--Bersonin\u2019s.\n\nNo doubt they had a light, but they should not use it. It was come to the crisis now, and I rushed down the steps and flung myself against the door.",
    "And surely he would have killed the King, and perhaps me also, had it not been for one devoted man who gave his life for the King. For when I forced the door, the sight I saw was this: the King stood in the corner of the room: broken by his sickness, he could do nothing; his fettered hands moved uselessly up and down, and he was laughing horribly in half-mad delirium. Detchard and the doctor were together in the middle of the room; and the doctor had flung himself on the murderer, pinning his hands to his sides for an instant. Then Detchard wrenched himself free from the feeble grip, and, as I entered, drove his sword through the hapless man. Then he turned on me, crying:\n\n\u201cAt last!\u201d\n\nWe were sword to sword. By blessed chance, neither he nor Bersonin had been wearing their revolvers. I found them afterwards, ready loaded, on the mantelpiece of the outer room: it was hard by the door, ready to their hands, but my sudden rush in had cut off access to them. Yes, we were man to man: and we began to fight, silently, sternly, and hard. Yet I remember little of it, save that the man was my match with the sword--nay, and more, for he knew more tricks than I; and that he forced me back against the bars that guarded the entrance to \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder.\u201d And I saw a smile on his face, and he wounded me in the left arm.\n\nNo glory do I take for that contest. I believe that the man would have mastered me and slain me, and then done his butcher\u2019s work, for he was the most skilful swordsman I have ever met; but even as he pressed me hard, the half-mad, wasted, wan creature in the corner leapt high in lunatic mirth, shrieking:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cousin Rudolf! Cousin Rudolf! I\u2019ll help you, cousin Rudolf!\u201d and catching up a chair in his hands (he could but just lift it from the ground and hold it uselessly before him) he came towards us. Hope came to me. \u201cCome on!\u201d I cried. \u201cCome on! Drive it against his legs.\u201d\n\nDetchard replied with a savage thrust. He all but had me.\n\n\u201cCome on! Come on, man!\u201d I cried. \u201cCome and share the fun!\u201d\n\nAnd the King laughed gleefully, and came on, pushing his chair before him.\n\nWith an oath Detchard skipped back, and, before I knew what he was doing, had turned his sword against the King. He made one fierce cut at the King, and the King, with a piteous cry, dropped where he stood. The stout ruffian turned to face me again. But his own hand had prepared his destruction: for in turning he trod in the pool of blood that flowed from the dead physician. He slipped; he fell. Like a dart I was upon him. I caught him by the throat, and before he could recover himself I drove my point through his neck, and with a stifled curse he fell across the body of his victim.\n\n\nWas the King dead? It was my first thought. I rushed to where he lay. Ay, it seemed as if he were dead, for he had a great gash across his forehead, and he lay still in a huddled heap on the floor. I dropped on my knees beside him, and leant my ear down to hear if he breathed. But before I could there was a loud rattle from the outside. I knew the sound: the drawbridge was being pushed out. A moment later it rang home against the wall on my side of the moat. I should be caught in a trap and the King with me, if he yet lived. He must take his chance, to live or die. I took my sword, and passed into the outer room. Who were pushing the drawbridge out--my men? If so, all was well. My eye fell on the revolvers, and I seized one; and paused to listen in the doorway of the outer room. To listen, say I? Yes, and to get my breath: and I tore my shirt and twisted a strip of it round my bleeding arm; and stood listening again. I would have given the world to hear Sapt\u2019s voice. For I was faint, spent, and weary. And that wild-cat Rupert Hentzau was yet at large in the Castle. Yet, because I could better defend the narrow door at the top of the stairs than the wider entrance to the room, I dragged myself up the steps, and stood behind it listening.\n\n\nWhat was the sound? Again a strange one for the place and time. An easy, scornful, merry laugh--the laugh of young Rupert Hentzau! I could scarcely believe that a sane man would laugh. Yet the laugh told me that my men had not come; for they must have shot Rupert ere now, if they had come. And the clock struck half-past two! My God! The door had not been opened! They had gone to the bank! They had not found me! They had gone by now back to Tarlenheim, with the news of the King\u2019s death--and mine. Well, it would be true before they got there. Was not Rupert laughing in triumph?\n\n\nFor a moment, I sank, unnerved, against the door. Then I started up alert again, for Rupert cried scornfully:\n\n\u201cWell, the bridge is there! Come over it! And in God\u2019s name, let\u2019s see Black Michael. Keep back, you curs! Michael, come and fight for her!\u201d\n\n\nIf it were a three-cornered fight, I might yet bear my part. I turned the key in the door and looked out.",
    "For a moment I could see nothing, for the glare of lanterns and torches caught me full in the eyes from the other side of the bridge. But soon the scene grew clear: and it was a strange scene. The bridge was in its place. At the far end of it stood a group of the duke\u2019s servants; two or three carried the lights which had dazzled me, three or four held pikes in rest. They were huddled together; their weapons were protruded before them; their faces were pale and agitated. To put it plainly, they looked in as arrant a fright as I have seen men look, and they gazed apprehensively at a man who stood in the middle of the bridge, sword in hand. Rupert Hentzau was in his trousers and shirt; the white linen was stained with blood, but his easy, buoyant pose told me that he was himself either not touched at all or merely scratched. There he stood, holding the bridge against them, and daring them to come on; or, rather, bidding them send Black Michael to him; and they, having no firearms, cowered before the desperate man and dared not attack him. They whispered to one another; and in the backmost rank, I saw my friend Johann, leaning against the portal of the door and stanching with a handkerchief the blood which flowed from a wound in his cheek.\n\n\nBy marvellous chance, I was master. The cravens would oppose me no more than they dared attack Rupert. I had but to raise my revolver, and I sent him to his account with his sins on his head. He did not so much as know that I was there. I did nothing--why, I hardly know to this day. I had killed one man stealthily that night, and another by luck rather than skill--perhaps it was that. Again, villain as the man was, I did not relish being one of a crowd against him--perhaps it was that. But stronger than either of these restrained feelings came a curiosity and a fascination which held me spellbound, watching for the outcome of the scene.\n\n\n\u201cMichael, you dog! Michael! If you can stand, come on!\u201d cried Rupert; and he advanced a step, the group shrinking back a little before him. \u201cMichael, you bastard! Come on!\u201d\n\n\nThe answer to his taunts came in the wild cry of a woman:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead! My God, he\u2019s dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cDead!\u201d shouted Rupert. \u201cI struck better than I knew!\u201d and he laughed triumphantly. Then he went on: \u201cDown with your weapons there! I\u2019m your master now! Down with them, I say!\u201d\n\n\nI believe they would have obeyed, but as he spoke came new things. First, there arose a distant sound, as of shouts and knockings from the other side of the chateau. My heart leapt. It must be my men, come by a happy disobedience to seek me. The noise continued, but none of the rest seemed to heed it. Their attention was chained by what now happened before their eyes. The group of servants parted and a woman staggered on to the bridge. Antoinette de Mauban was in a loose white robe, her dark hair streamed over her shoulders, her face was ghastly pale, and her eyes gleamed wildly in the light of the torches. In her shaking hand she held a revolver, and, as she tottered forward, she fired it at Rupert Hentzau. The ball missed him, and struck the woodwork over my head.\n\n\n\u201cFaith, madame,\u201d laughed Rupert, \u201chad your eyes been no more deadly than your shooting, I had not been in this scrape--nor Black Michael in hell--tonight!\u201d\n\n\nShe took no notice of his words. With a wonderful effort, she calmed herself till she stood still and rigid. Then very slowly and deliberately she began to raise her arm again, taking most careful aim.\n\n\nHe would be mad to risk it. He must rush on her, chancing the bullet, or retreat towards me. I covered him with my weapon.\n\n\nHe did neither. Before she had got her aim, he bowed in his most graceful fashion, cried \u201cI can\u2019t kill where I\u2019ve kissed,\u201d and before she or I could stop him, laid his hand on the parapet of the bridge, and lightly leapt into the moat.\n\n\nAt that very moment I heard a rush of feet, and a voice I knew--Sapt\u2019s--cry: \u201cGod! it\u2019s the duke--dead!\u201d Then I knew that the King needed me no more, and throwing down my revolver, I sprang out on the bridge. There was a cry of wild wonder, \u201cThe King!\u201d and then I, like Rupert of Hentzau, sword in hand, vaulted over the parapet, intent on finishing my quarrel with him where I saw his curly head fifteen yards off in the water of the moat.\n\n\nHe swam swiftly and easily. I was weary and half crippled with my wounded arm. I could not gain on him. For a time I made no sound, but as we rounded the corner of the old keep I cried:\n\n\u201cStop, Rupert, stop!\u201d\n\n\nI saw him look over his shoulder, but he swam on. He was under the bank now, searching, as I guessed, for a spot that he could climb. I knew there to be none--but there was my rope, which would still be hanging where I had left it. He would come to where it was before I could. Perhaps he would miss it--perhaps he would find it; and if he drew it up after him, he would get a good start of me. I put forth all my remaining strength and pressed on. At last I began to gain on him; for he, occupied with his search, unconsciously slackened his pace.\n\n\nAh, he had found it! A low shout of triumph came from him. He laid hold of it and began to haul himself up. I was near enough to hear him mutter: \u201cHow the devil comes this here?\u201d I was at the rope, and he, hanging in mid air, saw me, but I could not reach him.\n\n\u201cHullo! who\u2019s here?\u201d he cried in startled tones.\n\n\nFor a moment, I believe, he took me for the King--I dare say I was pale enough to lend colour to the thought; but an instant later he cried:\n\n\u201cWhy it\u2019s the play-actor! How come you here, man?\u201d\n\n\nAnd so saying he gained the bank.\n\n\nI laid hold of the rope, but I paused. He stood on the bank, sword in hand, and he could cut my head open or spit me through the heart as I came up. I let go the rope.\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said I; \u201cbut as I am here, I think I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\n\n\nHe smiled down on me.\n\n\u201cThese women are the deuce--\u201d he began; when suddenly the great bell of the Castle started to ring furiously, and a loud shout reached us from the moat.\n\n\nRupert smiled again, and waved his hand to me.\n\n\u201cI should like a turn with you, but it\u2019s a little too hot!\u201d said he, and he disappeared from above me.",
    "It was night, and I was in the cell wherein the King had lain in the Castle of Zenda. The great pipe that Rupert of Hentzau had nicknamed \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d was gone, and the lights in the room across the moat twinkled in the darkness. All was still; the din and clash of strife were gone. I had spent the day hidden in the forest, from the time when Fritz had led me off, leaving Sapt with the princess. Under cover of dusk, muffled up, I had been brought to the Castle and lodged where I now lay. Though three men had died there--two of them by my hand--I was not troubled by ghosts. I had thrown myself on a pallet by the window, and was looking out on the black water; Johann, the keeper, still pale from his wound, but not much hurt besides, had brought me supper. He told me that the King was doing well, that he had seen the princess; that she and he, Sapt and Fritz, had been long together. Marshal Strakencz was gone to Strelsau; Black Michael lay in his coffin, and Antoinette de Mauban watched by him; had I not heard, from the chapel, priests singing mass for him?\n\n\nOutside there were strange rumours afloat. Some said that the prisoner of Zenda was dead; some, that he had vanished yet alive; some, that he was a friend who had served the King well in some adventure in England; others, that he had discovered the Duke\u2019s plots, and had therefore been kidnapped by him. One or two shrewd fellows shook their heads and said only that they would say nothing, but they had suspicions that more was to be known than was known, if Colonel Sapt would tell all he knew.\n\n\nThus Johann chattered till I sent him away and lay there alone, thinking, not of the future, but--as a man is wont to do when stirring things have happened to him--rehearsing the events of the past weeks, and wondering how strangely they had fallen out. And above me, in the stillness of the night, I heard the standards flapping against their poles, for Black Michael\u2019s banner hung there half-mast high, and above it the royal flag of Ruritania, floating for one night more over my head. Habit grows so quick, that only by an effort did I recollect that it floated no longer for me.\n\n\nPresently Fritz von Tarlenheim came into the room. I was standing then by the window; the glass was opened, and I was idly fingering the cement which clung to the masonry where \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d had been. He told me briefly that the King wanted me, and together we crossed the drawbridge and entered the room that had been Black Michael\u2019s.\n\n\nThe King was lying there in bed; our doctor from Tarlenheim was in attendance on him, and whispered to me that my visit must be brief. The King held out his hand and shook mine. Fritz and the doctor withdrew to the window.\n\n\nI took the King\u2019s ring from my finger and placed it on his.\n\n\u201cI have tried not to dishonour it, sire,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t talk much to you,\u201d he said, in a weak voice. \u201cI have had a great fight with Sapt and the Marshal--for we have told the Marshal everything. I wanted to take you to Strelsau and keep you with me, and tell everyone of what you had done; and you would have been my best and nearest friend, Cousin Rudolf. But they tell me I must not, and that the secret must be kept--if kept it can be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are right, sire. Let me go. My work here is done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is done, as no man but you could have done it. When they see me again, I shall have my beard on; I shall--yes, faith, I shall be wasted with sickness. They will not wonder that the King looks changed in face. Cousin, I shall try to let them find him changed in nothing else. You have shown me how to play the King.\u201d\n\n\u201cSire,\u201d said I. \u201cI can take no praise from you. It is by the narrowest grace of God that I was not a worse traitor than your brother.\u201d\n\n\nHe turned inquiring eyes on me; but a sick man shrinks from puzzles, and he had no strength to question me. His glance fell on Flavia\u2019s ring, which I wore. I thought he would question me about it; but, after fingering it idly, he let his head fall on his pillow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when I shall see you again,\u201d he said faintly, almost listlessly.\n\n\u201cIf I can ever serve you again, sire,\u201d I answered.\n\n\nHis eyelids closed. Fritz came with the doctor. I kissed the King\u2019s hand, and let Fritz lead me away. I have never seen the King since.\n\n\nOutside, Fritz turned, not to the right, back towards the drawbridge, but to the left, and without speaking led me upstairs, through a handsome corridor in the chateau.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked.\n\nLooking away from me, Fritz answered:\n\n\u201cShe has sent for you. When it is over, come back to the bridge. I\u2019ll wait for you there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does she want?\u201d said I, breathing quickly.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\u201cDoes she know everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, everything.\u201d\n\n\nHe opened a door, and gently pushing me in, closed it behind me."

  "John Buchan -- Greenmantle": [
    "I had just finished breakfast and was filling my pipe when I got Bullivant\u2019s telegram. It was at Furling, the big country house in Hampshire where I had come to convalesce after Loos, and Sandy, who was in the same case, was hunting for the marmalade. I flung him the flimsy with the blue strip pasted down on it, and he whistled.\n\n\u201cHullo, Dick, you\u2019ve got the battalion. Or maybe it\u2019s a staff billet. You\u2019ll be a blighted brass-hat, coming it heavy over the hard-working regimental officer. And to think of the language you\u2019ve wasted on brass-hats in your time!\u201d\n\nI sat and thought for a bit, for the name \u201cBullivant\u201d carried me back eighteen months to the hot summer before the war. I had not seen the man since, though I had read about him in the papers. For more than a year I had been a busy battalion officer, with no other thought than to hammer a lot of raw stuff into good soldiers. I had succeeded pretty well, and there was no prouder man on earth than Richard Hannay when he took his Lennox Highlanders over the parapets on that glorious and bloody 25th day of September. Loos was no picnic, and we had had some ugly bits of scrapping before that, but the worst bit of the campaign I had seen was a tea-party to the show I had been in with Bullivant before the war started. [Major Hannay\u2019s narrative of this affair has been published under the title of _The Thirty-nine Steps_.]\n\nThe sight of his name on a telegram form seemed to change all my outlook on life. I had been hoping for the command of the battalion, and looking forward to being in at the finish with Brother Boche. But this message jerked my thoughts on to a new road. There might be other things in the war than straightforward fighting. Why on earth should the Foreign Office want to see an obscure Major of the New Army, and want to see him in double-quick time?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going up to town by the ten train,\u201d I announced; \u201cI\u2019ll be back in time for dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry my tailor,\u201d said Sandy. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very nice taste in red tabs. You can use my name.\u201d\n\nAn idea struck me. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty well all right now. If I wire for you, will you pack your own kit and mine and join me?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight-o! I\u2019ll accept a job on your staff if they give you a corps. If so be as you come down tonight, be a good chap and bring a barrel of oysters from Sweeting\u2019s.\u201d\n\nI travelled up to London in a regular November drizzle, which cleared up about Wimbledon to watery sunshine. I never could stand London during the war. It seemed to have lost its bearings and broken out into all manner of badges and uniforms which did not fit in with my notion of it. One felt the war more in its streets than in the field, or rather one felt the confusion of war without feeling the purpose. I dare say it was all right; but since August 1914 I never spent a day in town without coming home depressed to my boots.\n\nI took a taxi and drove straight to the Foreign Office. Sir Walter did not keep me waiting long. But when his secretary took me to his room I would not have recognized the man I had known eighteen months before.\n\nHis big frame seemed to have dropped flesh and there was a stoop in the square shoulders. His face had lost its rosiness and was red in patches, like that of a man who gets too little fresh air. His hair was much greyer and very thin about the temples, and there were lines of overwork below the eyes. But the eyes were the same as before, keen and kindly and shrewd, and there was no change in the firm set of the jaw.\n\n\u201cWe must on no account be disturbed for the next hour,\u201d he told his secretary. When the young man had gone he went across to both doors and turned the keys in them.\n\n\u201cWell, Major Hannay,\u201d he said, flinging himself into a chair beside the fire. \u201cHow do you like soldiering?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight enough,\u201d I said, \u201cthough this isn\u2019t just the kind of war I would have picked myself. It\u2019s a comfortless, bloody business. But we\u2019ve got the measure of the old Boche now, and it\u2019s dogged as does it. I count on getting back to the front in a week or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you get the battalion?\u201d he asked. He seemed to have followed my doings pretty closely.\n\n\u201cI believe I\u2019ve a good chance. I\u2019m not in this show for honour and glory, though. I want to do the best I can, but I wish to heaven it was over. All I think of is coming out of it with a whole skin.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cYou do yourself an injustice. What about the forward observation post at the Lone Tree? You forgot about the whole skin then.\u201d\n\nI felt myself getting red. \u201cThat was all rot,\u201d I said, \u201cand I can\u2019t think who told you about it. I hated the job, but I had to do it to prevent my subalterns going to glory. They were a lot of fire-eating young lunatics. If I had sent one of them he\u2019d have gone on his knees to Providence and asked for trouble.\u201d\n\nSir Walter was still grinning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not questioning your caution. You have the rudiments of it, or our friends of the Black Stone would have gathered you in at our last merry meeting. I would question it as little as your courage. What exercises my mind is whether it is best employed in the trenches.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the War Office dissatisfied with me?\u201d I asked sharply.\n\n\u201cThey are profoundly satisfied. They propose to give you command of your battalion. Presently, if you escape a stray bullet, you will no doubt be a Brigadier. It is a wonderful war for youth and brains. But ... I take it you are in this business to serve your country, Hannay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon I am,\u201d I said. \u201cI am certainly not in it for my health.\u201d\n\nHe looked at my leg, where the doctors had dug out the shrapnel fragments, and smiled quizzically.\n\n\u201cPretty fit again?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cTough as a sjambok. I thrive on the racket and eat and sleep like a schoolboy.\u201d\n\nHe got up and stood with his back to the fire, his eyes staring abstractedly out of the window at the wintry park.",
    "Sure enough I found my man in the Grill Room. There he was, feeding solemnly, with a napkin tucked under his chin. He was a big fellow with a fat, sallow, clean-shaven face. I disregarded the hovering waiter and pulled up a chair beside the American at the little table. He turned on me a pair of full sleepy eyes, like a ruminating ox.\n\n\u201cMr Blenkiron?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYou have my name, Sir,\u201d he said. \u201cMr John Scantlebury Blenkiron. I would wish you good morning if I saw anything good in this darned British weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cI come from Sir Walter Bullivant,\u201d I said, speaking low.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d said he. \u201cSir Walter is a very good friend of mine. Pleased to meet you, Mr\u2014or I guess it\u2019s Colonel\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHannay,\u201d I said; \u201cMajor Hannay.\u201d I was wondering what this sleepy Yankee could do to help me.\n\n\u201cAllow me to offer you luncheon, Major. Here, waiter, bring the carte. I regret that I cannot join you in sampling the efforts of the management of this hotel. I suffer, Sir, from dyspepsia\u2014duodenal dyspepsia. It gets me two hours after a meal and gives me hell just below the breast-bone. So I am obliged to adopt a diet. My nourishment is fish, Sir, and boiled milk and a little dry toast. It\u2019s a melancholy descent from the days when I could do justice to a lunch at Sherry\u2019s and sup off oyster-crabs and devilled bones.\u201d He sighed from the depths of his capacious frame.\n\nI ordered an omelette and a chop, and took another look at him. The large eyes seemed to be gazing steadily at me without seeing me. They were as vacant as an abstracted child\u2019s; but I had an uncomfortable feeling that they saw more than mine.\n\n\u201cYou have been fighting, Major? The Battle of Loos? Well, I guess that must have been some battle. We in America respect the fighting of the British soldier, but we don\u2019t quite catch on to the de-vices of the British Generals. We opine that there is more bellicosity than science among your highbrows. That is so? My father fought at Chattanooga, but these eyes have seen nothing gorier than a Presidential election. Say, is there any way I could be let into a scene of real bloodshed?\u201d\n\nHis serious tone made me laugh. \u201cThere are plenty of your countrymen in the present show,\u201d I said. \u201cThe French Foreign Legion is full of young Americans, and so is our Army Service Corps. Half the chauffeurs you strike in France seem to come from the States.\u201d\n\nHe sighed. \u201cI did think of some belligerent stunt a year back. But I reflected that the good God had not given John S. Blenkiron the kind of martial figure that would do credit to the tented field. Also I recollected that we Americans were nootrals\u2014benevolent nootrals\u2014and that it did not become me to be butting into the struggles of the effete monarchies of Europe. So I stopped at home. It was a big renunciation, Major, for I was lying sick during the Philippines business, and I have never seen the lawless passions of men let loose on a battlefield. And, as a stoodent of humanity, I hankered for the experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you been doing?\u201d I asked. The calm gentleman had begun to interest me.\n\n\u201cWaal,\u201d he said, \u201cI just waited. The Lord has blessed me with money to burn, so I didn\u2019t need to go scrambling like a wild cat for war contracts. But I reckoned I would get let into the game somehow, and I was. Being a nootral, I was in an advantageous position to take a hand. I had a pretty hectic time for a while, and then I reckoned I would leave God\u2019s country and see what was doing in Europe. I have counted myself out of the bloodshed business, but, as your poet sings, peace has its victories not less renowned than war, and I reckon that means that a nootral can have a share in a scrap as well as a belligerent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best kind of neutrality I\u2019ve ever heard of,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right kind,\u201d he replied solemnly. \u201cSay, Major, what are your lot fighting for? For your own skins and your Empire and the peace of Europe. Waal, those ideals don\u2019t concern us one cent. We\u2019re not Europeans, and there aren\u2019t any German trenches on Long Island yet. You\u2019ve made the ring in Europe, and if we came butting in it wouldn\u2019t be the rules of the game. You wouldn\u2019t welcome us, and I guess you\u2019d be right. We\u2019re that delicate-minded we can\u2019t interfere and that was what my friend, President Wilson, meant when he opined that America was too proud to fight. So we\u2019re nootrals. But likewise we\u2019re benevolent nootrals. As I follow events, there\u2019s a skunk been let loose in the world, and the odour of it is going to make life none too sweet till it is cleared away. It wasn\u2019t us that stirred up that skunk, but we\u2019ve got to take a hand in disinfecting the planet. See? We can\u2019t fight, but, by God! some of us are going to sweat blood to sweep the mess up. Officially we do nothing except give off Notes like a leaky boiler gives off steam. But as individooal citizens we\u2019re in it up to the neck. So, in the spirit of Jefferson Davis and Woodrow Wilson, I\u2019m going to be the nootralist kind of nootral till Kaiser will be sorry he didn\u2019t declare war on America at the beginning.\u201d\n\nI was completely recovering my temper. This fellow was a perfect jewel, and his spirit put purpose into me.\n\n\u201cI guess you British were the same kind of nootral when your Admiral warned off the German fleet from interfering with Dewey in Manila Bay in \u201998.\u201d Mr Blenkiron drank up the last drop of his boiled milk and lit a thin black cigar.",
    "We talked to each other of Maritz and our doings. It didn\u2019t seem to be a popular subject in that cafe. One big blue-black fellow said that Maritz was a dirty swine who would soon be hanged. Peter quickly caught his knife-wrist with one hand and his throat with the other, and demanded an apology. He got it. The Lisbon _boulevardiers_ have not lost any lions.\n\nAfter that there was a bit of a squash in our corner. Those near to us were very quiet and polite, but the outer fringe made remarks. When Peter said that if Portugal, which he admitted he loved, was going to stick to England she was backing the wrong horse, there was a murmur of disapproval. One decent-looking old fellow, who had the air of a ship\u2019s captain, flushed all over his honest face, and stood up looking straight at Peter. I saw that we had struck an Englishman, and mentioned it to Peter in Dutch.\n\nPeter played his part perfectly. He suddenly shut up, and, with furtive looks around him, began to jabber to me in a low voice. He was the very picture of the old stage conspirator.\n\nThe old fellow stood staring at us. \u201cI don\u2019t very well understand this damned lingo,\u201d he said; \u201cbut if so be you dirty Dutchmen are sayin\u2019 anything against England, I\u2019ll ask you to repeat it. And if so be as you repeats it I\u2019ll take either of you on and knock the face off him.\u201d\n\nHe was a chap after my own heart, but I had to keep the game up. I said in Dutch to Peter that we mustn\u2019t get brawling in a public house. \u201cRemember the big thing,\u201d I said darkly. Peter nodded, and the old fellow, after staring at us for a bit, spat scornfully, and walked out.\n\n\u201cThe time is coming when the Englander will sing small,\u201d I observed to the crowd. We stood drinks to one or two, and then swaggered into the street. At the door a hand touched my arm, and, looking down, I saw a little scrap of a man in a fur coat.\n\n\u201cWill the gentlemen walk a step with me and drink a glass of beer?\u201d he said in very stiff Dutch.\n\n\u201cWho the devil are you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201c_Gott strafe England!_\u201d was his answer, and, turning back the lapel of his coat, he showed some kind of ribbon in his buttonhole.\n\n\u201cAmen,\u201d said Peter. \u201cLead on, friend. We don\u2019t mind if we do.\u201d\n\nHe led us to a back street and then up two pairs of stairs to a very snug little flat. The place was filled with fine red lacquer, and I guessed that art-dealing was his nominal business. Portugal, since the republic broke up the convents and sold up the big royalist grandees, was full of bargains in the lacquer and curio line.\n\nHe filled us two long tankards of very good Munich beer.\n\n\u201c_Prosit_,\u201d he said, raising his glass. \u201cYou are from South Africa. What make you in Europe?\u201d\n\nWe both looked sullen and secretive.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our own business,\u201d I answered. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to buy our confidence with a glass of beer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d he said. \u201cThen I will put it differently. From your speech in the cafe I judge you do not love the English.\u201d\n\nPeter said something about stamping on their grandmothers, a Kaffir phrase which sounded gruesome in Dutch.\n\nThe man laughed. \u201cThat is all I want to know. You are on the German side?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d I said. \u201cIf they treat me fair I\u2019ll fight for them, or for anybody else that makes war on England. England has stolen my country and corrupted my people and made me an exile. We Afrikanders do not forget. We may be slow but we win in the end. We two are men worth a great price. Germany fights England in East Africa. We know the natives as no Englishmen can ever know them. They are too soft and easy and the Kaffirs laugh at them. But we can handle the blacks so that they will fight like devils for fear of us. What is the reward, little man, for our services? I will tell you. There will be no reward. We ask none. We fight for hate of England.\u201d\n\nPeter grunted a deep approval.\n\n\u201cThat is good talk,\u201d said our entertainer, and his close-set eyes flashed. \u201cThere is room in Germany for such men as you. Where are you going now, I beg to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo Holland,\u201d I said. \u201cThen maybe we will go to Germany. We are tired with travel and may rest a bit. This war will last long and our chance will come.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you may miss your market,\u201d he said significantly. \u201cA ship sails tomorrow for Rotterdam. If you take my advice, you will go with her.\u201d\n\nThis was what I wanted, for if we stayed in Lisbon some real soldier of Maritz might drop in any day and blow the gaff.\n\n\u201cI recommend you to sail in the _Machado_,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThere is work for you in Germany\u2014oh yes, much work; but if you delay the chance may pass. I will arrange your journey. It is my business to help the allies of my fatherland.\u201d\n\nHe wrote down our names and an epitome of our doings contributed by Peter, who required two mugs of beer to help him through. He was a Bavarian, it seemed, and we drank to the health of Prince Rupprecht, the same blighter I was trying to do in at Loos. That was an irony which Peter unfortunately could not appreciate. If he could he would have enjoyed it.\n\nThe little chap saw us back to our hotel, and was with us the next morning after breakfast, bringing the steamer tickets. We got on board about two in the afternoon, but on my advice he did not see us off. I told him that, being British subjects and rebels at that, we did not want to run any risks on board, assuming a British cruiser caught us up and searched us. But Peter took twenty pounds off him for travelling expenses, it being his rule never to miss an opportunity of spoiling the Egyptians.",
    "The winter evening closed in, and I saw that we had come out of the hills and were in flat country. Sometimes a big sweep of river showed, and, looking out at one station I saw a funny church with a thing like an onion on top of its spire. It might almost have been a mosque, judging from the pictures I remembered of mosques. I wished to heaven I had given geography more attention in my time. Presently we stopped, and Stumm led the way out. The train must have been specially halted for him, for it was a one-horse little place whose name I could not make out. The station-master was waiting, bowing and saluting, and outside was a motor-car with big head-lights. Next minute we were sliding through dark woods where the snow lay far deeper than in the north. There was a mild frost in the air, and the tyres slipped and skidded at the corners.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t far to go. We climbed a little hill and on the top of it stopped at the door of a big black castle. It looked enormous in the winter night, with not a light showing anywhere on its front. The door was opened by an old fellow who took a long time about it and got well cursed for his slowness. Inside the place was very noble and ancient. Stumm switched on the electric light, and there was a great hall with black tarnished portraits of men and women in old-fashioned clothes, and mighty horns of deer on the walls.\n\nThere seemed to be no superfluity of servants. The old fellow said that food was ready, and without more ado we went into the dining-room\u2014another vast chamber with rough stone walls above the panelling\u2014and found some cold meats on the table beside a big fire. The servant presently brought in a ham omelette, and on that and the cold stuff we dined. I remember there was nothing to drink but water. It puzzled me how Stumm kept his great body going on the very moderate amount of food he ate. He was the type you expect to swill beer by the bucket and put away a pie in a sitting.\n\nWhen we had finished, he rang for the old man and told him that we should be in the study for the rest of the evening. \u201cYou can lock up and go to bed when you like,\u201d he said, \u201cbut see you have coffee ready at seven sharp in the morning.\u201d\n\nEver since I entered that house I had the uncomfortable feeling of being in a prison. Here was I alone in this great place with a fellow who could, and would, wring my neck if he wanted. Berlin and all the rest of it had seemed comparatively open country; I had felt that I could move freely and at the worst make a bolt for it. But here I was trapped, and I had to tell myself every minute that I was there as a friend and colleague. The fact is, I was afraid of Stumm, and I don\u2019t mind admitting it. He was a new thing in my experience and I didn\u2019t like it. If only he had drunk and guzzled a bit I should have been happier.\n\nWe went up a staircase to a room at the end of a long corridor. Stumm locked the door behind him and laid the key on the table. That room took my breath away, it was so unexpected. In place of the grim bareness of downstairs here was a place all luxury and colour and light. It was very large, but low in the ceiling, and the walls were full of little recesses with statues in them. A thick grey carpet of velvet pile covered the floor, and the chairs were low and soft and upholstered like a lady\u2019s boudoir. A pleasant fire burned on the hearth and there was a flavour of scent in the air, something like incense or burnt sandalwood. A French clock on the mantelpiece told me that it was ten minutes past eight. Everywhere on little tables and in cabinets was a profusion of knickknacks, and there was some beautiful embroidery framed on screens. At first sight you would have said it was a woman\u2019s drawing-room.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t. I soon saw the difference. There had never been a woman\u2019s hand in that place. It was the room of a man who had a passion for frippery, who had a perverted taste for soft delicate things. It was the complement to his bluff brutality. I began to see the queer other side to my host, that evil side which gossip had spoken of as not unknown in the German army. The room seemed a horribly unwholesome place, and I was more than ever afraid of Stumm.\n\nThe hearthrug was a wonderful old Persian thing, all faint greens and pinks. As he stood on it he looked uncommonly like a bull in a china-shop. He seemed to bask in the comfort of it, and sniffed like a satisfied animal. Then he sat down at an escritoire, unlocked a drawer and took out some papers.\n\n\u201cWe will now settle your business, friend Brandt,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will go to Egypt and there take your orders from one whose name and address are in this envelope. This card,\u201d and he lifted a square piece of grey pasteboard with a big stamp at the corner and some code words stencilled on it, \u201cwill be your passport. You will show it to the man you seek. Keep it jealously, and never use it save under orders or in the last necessity. It is your badge as an accredited agent of the German Crown.\u201d\n\nI took the card and the envelope and put them in my pocket-book.\n\n\u201cWhere do I go after Egypt?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThat remains to be seen. Probably you will go up the Blue Nile. Riza, the man you will meet, will direct you. Egypt is a nest of our agents who work peacefully under the nose of the English Secret Service.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am willing,\u201d I said. \u201cBut how do I reach Egypt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will travel by Holland and London. Here is your route,\u201d and he took a paper from his pocket. \u201cYour passports are ready and will be given you at the frontier.\u201d\n\nThis was a pretty kettle of fish. I was to be packed off to Cairo by sea, which would take weeks, and God knows how I would get from Egypt to Constantinople. I saw all my plans falling to pieces about my ears, and just when I thought they were shaping nicely. Stumm must have interpreted the look on my face as fear.\n\n\u201cYou have no cause to be afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have passed the word to the English police to look out for a suspicious South African named Brandt, one of Maritz\u2019s rebels. It is not difficult to have that kind of a hint conveyed to the proper quarter. But the description will not be yours. Your name will be Van der Linden, a respectable Java merchant going home to his plantations after a visit to his native shores. You had better get your _dossier_ by heart, but I guarantee you will be asked no questions. We manage these things well in Germany.\u201d",
    "My mind was getting a little more active now; for the first part of the journey I had simply staggered from impulse to impulse. These impulses had been uncommon lucky, but I couldn\u2019t go on like that for ever. _Ek sal \u201cn plan maak_, says the old Boer when he gets into trouble, and it was up to me now to make a plan.\n\nAs soon as I began to think I saw the desperate business I was in for. Here was I, with nothing except what I stood up in\u2014including a coat and cap that weren\u2019t mine\u2014alone in mid-winter in the heart of South Germany. There was a man behind me looking for my blood, and soon there would be a hue-and-cry for me up and down the land. I had heard that the German police were pretty efficient, and I couldn\u2019t see that I stood the slimmest chance. If they caught me they would shoot me beyond doubt. I asked myself on what charge, and answered, \u201cFor knocking about a German officer.\u201d They couldn\u2019t have me up for espionage, for as far as I knew they had no evidence. I was simply a Dutchman that had got riled and had run amok. But if they cut down a cobbler for laughing at a second lieutenant\u2014which is what happened at Zabern\u2014I calculated that hanging would be too good for a man that had broken a colonel\u2019s jaw.\n\nTo make things worse my job was not to escape\u2014though that would have been hard enough\u2014but to get to Constantinople, more than a thousand miles off, and I reckoned I couldn\u2019t get there as a tramp. I had to be sent there, and now I had flung away my chance. If I had been a Catholic I would have said a prayer to St Teresa, for she would have understood my troubles.\n\nMy mother used to say that when you felt down on your luck it was a good cure to count your mercies. So I set about counting mine. The first was that I was well started on my journey, for I couldn\u2019t be above two score miles from the Danube. The second was that I had Stumm\u2019s pass. I didn\u2019t see how I could use it, but there it was. Lastly I had plenty of money\u2014fifty-three English sovereigns and the equivalent of three pounds in German paper which I had changed at the hotel. Also I had squared accounts with old Stumm. That was the biggest mercy of all.\n\nI thought I\u2019d better get some sleep, so I found a dryish hole below an oak root and squeezed myself into it. The snow lay deep in these woods and I was sopping wet up to the knees. All the same I managed to sleep for some hours, and got up and shook myself just as the winter\u2019s dawn was breaking through the tree tops. Breakfast was the next thing, and I must find some sort of dwelling.\n\nAlmost at once I struck a road, a big highway running north and south. I trotted along in the bitter morning to get my circulation started, and presently I began to feel a little better. In a little I saw a church spire, which meant a village. Stumm wouldn\u2019t be likely to have got on my tracks yet, I calculated, but there was always the chance that he had warned all the villages round by telephone and that they might be on the look-out for me. But that risk had to be taken, for I must have food.\n\nIt was the day before Christmas, I remembered, and people would be holidaying. The village was quite a big place, but at this hour\u2014just after eight o\u2019clock\u2014there was nobody in the street except a wandering dog. I chose the most unassuming shop I could find, where a little boy was taking down the shutters\u2014one of those general stores where they sell everything. The boy fetched a very old woman, who hobbled in from the back, fitting on her spectacles.\n\n\u201cGruss Gott,\u201d she said in a friendly voice, and I took off my cap. I saw from my reflection in a saucepan that I looked moderately respectable in spite of my night in the woods.\n\nI told her the story of how I was walking from Schwandorf to see my mother at an imaginary place called Judenfeld, banking on the ignorance of villagers about any place five miles from their homes. I said my luggage had gone astray, and I hadn\u2019t time to wait for it, since my leave was short. The old lady was sympathetic and unsuspecting. She sold me a pound of chocolate, a box of biscuits, the better part of a ham, two tins of sardines and a rucksack to carry them. I also bought some soap, a comb and a cheap razor, and a small Tourists\u2019 Guide, published by a Leipzig firm. As I was leaving I saw what seemed like garments hanging up in the back shop, and turned to have a look at them. They were the kind of thing that Germans wear on their summer walking tours\u2014long shooting capes made of a green stuff they call _loden_. I bought one, and a green felt hat and an alpenstock to keep it company. Then wishing the old woman and her belongings a merry Christmas, I departed and took the shortest cut out of the village. There were one or two people about now, but they did not seem to notice me.\n\nI went into the woods again and walked for two miles till I halted for breakfast. I was not feeling quite so fit now, and I did not make much of my provisions, beyond eating a biscuit and some chocolate. I felt very thirsty and longed for hot tea. In an icy pool I washed and with infinite agony shaved my beard. That razor was the worst of its species, and my eyes were running all the time with the pain of the operation. Then I took off the postman\u2019s coat and cap, and buried them below some bushes. I was now a clean-shaven German pedestrian with a green cape and hat, and an absurd walking-stick with an iron-shod end\u2014the sort of person who roams in thousands over the Fatherland in summer, but is a rarish bird in mid-winter.",
    "We battled to a corner, where a jut of building stood out into the street. It was our only chance to protect our backs, to stand up with the rib of stone between us. It was only the work of seconds. One instant we were groping our solitary way in the darkness, the next we were pinned against a wall with a throaty mob surging round us.\n\nIt took me a moment or two to realize that we were attacked. Every man has one special funk in the back of his head, and mine was to be the quarry of an angry crowd. I hated the thought of it\u2014the mess, the blind struggle, the sense of unleashed passions different from those of any single blackguard. It was a dark world to me, and I don\u2019t like darkness. But in my nightmares I had never imagined anything just like this. The narrow, fetid street, with the icy winds fanning the filth, the unknown tongue, the hoarse savage murmur, and my utter ignorance as to what it might all be about, made me cold in the pit of my stomach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got it in the neck this time, old man,\u201d I said to Peter, who had out the pistol the commandant at Rustchuk had given him. These pistols were our only weapons. The crowd saw them and hung back, but if they chose to rush us it wasn\u2019t much of a barrier two pistols would make.\n\nRasta\u2019s voice had stopped. He had done his work, and had retired to the background. There were shouts from the crowd\u2014\u201c_Alleman_\u201d and a word \u201c_Khafiyeh_\u201d constantly repeated. I didn\u2019t know what it meant at the time, but now I know that they were after us because we were Boches and spies. There was no love lost between the Constantinople scum and their new masters. It seemed an ironical end for Peter and me to be done in because we were Boches. And done in we should be. I had heard of the East as a good place for people to disappear in; there were no inquisitive newspapers or incorruptible police.\n\nI wished to Heaven I had a word of Turkish. But I made my voice heard for a second in a pause of the din, and shouted that we were German sailors who had brought down big guns for Turkey, and were going home next day. I asked them what the devil they thought we had done? I don\u2019t know if any fellow there understood German; anyhow, it only brought a pandemonium of cries in which that ominous word _Khafiyeh_ was predominant.\n\nThen Peter fired over their heads. He had to, for a chap was pawing at his throat. The answer was a clatter of bullets on the wall above us. It looked as if they meant to take us alive, and that I was very clear should not happen. Better a bloody end in a street scrap than the tender mercies of that bandbox bravo.\n\nI don\u2019t quite know what happened next. A press drove down at me and I fired. Someone squealed, and I looked the next moment to be strangled. And then, suddenly, the scrimmage ceased, and there was a wavering splash of light in that pit of darkness.\n\nI never went through many worse minutes than these. When I had been hunted in the past weeks there had been mystery enough, but no immediate peril to face. When I had been up against a real, urgent, physical risk, like Loos, the danger at any rate had been clear. One knew what one was in for. But here was a threat I couldn\u2019t put a name to, and it wasn\u2019t in the future, but pressing hard at our throats.\n\nAnd yet I couldn\u2019t feel it was quite real. The patter of the pistol bullets against the wall, like so many crackers, the faces felt rather than seen in the dark, the clamour which to me was pure gibberish, had all the madness of a nightmare. Only Peter, cursing steadily in Dutch by my side, was real. And then the light came, and made the scene more eerie!\n\nIt came from one or two torches carried by wild fellows with long staves who drove their way into the heart of the mob. The flickering glare ran up the steep walls and made monstrous shadows. The wind swung the flame into long streamers, dying away in a fan of sparks.\n\nAnd now a new word was heard in the crowd. It was _Chinganeh_, shouted not in anger but in fear.\n\nAt first I could not see the newcomers. They were hidden in the deep darkness under their canopy of light, for they were holding their torches high at the full stretch of their arms. They were shouting, too, wild shrill cries ending sometimes in a gush of rapid speech. Their words did not seem to be directed against us, but against the crowd. A sudden hope came to me that for some unknown reason they were on our side.\n\nThe press was no longer heavy against us. It was thinning rapidly and I could hear the scuffle as men made off down the side streets. My first notion was that these were the Turkish police. But I changed my mind when the leader came out into a patch of light. He carried no torch, but a long stave with which he belaboured the heads of those who were too tightly packed to flee.\n\nIt was the most eldritch apparition you can conceive. A tall man dressed in skins, with bare legs and sandal-shod feet. A wisp of scarlet cloth clung to his shoulders, and, drawn over his head down close to his eyes, was a skull-cap of some kind of pelt with the tail waving behind it. He capered like a wild animal, keeping up a strange high monotone that fairly gave me the creeps.\n\nI was suddenly aware that the crowd had gone. Before us was only this figure and his half-dozen companions, some carrying torches and all wearing clothes of skin. But only the one who seemed to be their leader wore the skull-cap; the rest had bare heads and long tangled hair.\n\nThe fellow was shouting gibberish at me. His eyes were glassy, like a man who smokes hemp, and his legs were never still for a second. You would think such a figure no better than a mountebank, and yet there was nothing comic in it. Fearful and sinister and uncanny it was; and I wanted to do anything but laugh.\n\nAs he shouted he kept pointing with his stave up the street which climbed the hillside.\n\n\u201cHe means us to move,\u201d said Peter. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake let us get away from this witch-doctor.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t make sense of it, but one thing was clear. These maniacs had delivered us for the moment from Rasta and his friends.\n\nThen I did a dashed silly thing. I pulled out a sovereign and offered it to the leader. I had some kind of notion of showing gratitude, and as I had no words I had to show it by deed.\n\nHe brought his stick down on my wrist and sent the coin spinning in the gutter. His eyes blazed, and he made his weapon sing round my head. He cursed me\u2014oh, I could tell cursing well enough, though I didn\u2019t follow a word; and he cried to his followers and they cursed me too. I had offered him a mortal insult and stirred up a worse hornet\u2019s nest than Rasta\u2019s push.\n\nPeter and I, with a common impulse, took to our heels. We were not looking for any trouble with demoniacs. Up the steep, narrow lane we ran with that bedlamite crowd at our heels. The torches seemed to have gone out, for the place was black as pitch, and we tumbled over heaps of offal and splashed through running drains. The men were close behind us, and more than once I felt a stick on my shoulder. But fear lent us wings, and suddenly before us was a blaze of light and we saw the debouchment of our street in a main thoroughfare. The others saw it, too, for they slackened off. Just before we reached the light we stopped and looked round. There was no sound or sight behind us in the dark lane which dipped to the harbour.\n\n\u201cThis is a queer country, Cornelis,\u201d said Peter, feeling his limbs for bruises. \u201cToo many things happen in too short a time. I am breathless.\u201d",
    "I looked at Sandy. He filled his pipe again, and pushed back his skin cap from his brows. What with his long dishevelled hair, his high-boned face, and stained eyebrows he had the appearance of some mad mullah.\n\u201cI went straight to Smyrna,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t difficult, for you see I had laid down a good many lines in former travels. I reached the town as a Greek money-lender from the Fayum, but I had friends there I could count on, and the same evening I was a Turkish gipsy, a member of the most famous fraternity in Western Asia. I had long been a member, and I\u2019m blood-brother of the chief boss, so I stepped into the part ready made. But I found out that the Company of the Rosy Hours was not what I had known it in 1910. Then it had been all for the Young Turks and reform; now it hankered after the old regime and was the last hope of the Orthodox. It had no use for Enver and his friends, and it did not regard with pleasure the _beaux yeux_ of the Teuton. It stood for Islam and the old ways, and might be described as a Conservative-Nationalist caucus. But it was uncommon powerful in the provinces, and Enver and Talaat daren\u2019t meddle with it. The dangerous thing about it was that it said nothing and apparently did nothing. It just bided its time and took notes.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that this was the very kind of crowd for my purpose. I knew of old its little ways, for with all its orthodoxy it dabbled a good deal in magic, and owed half its power to its atmosphere of the uncanny. The Companions could dance the heart out of the ordinary Turk. You saw a bit of one of our dances this afternoon, Dick\u2014pretty good, wasn\u2019t it? They could go anywhere, and no questions asked. They knew what the ordinary man was thinking, for they were the best intelligence department in the Ottoman Empire\u2014far better than Enver\u2019s _Khafiyeh_. And they were popular, too, for they had never bowed the knee to the _Nemseh_\u2014the Germans who are squeezing out the life-blood of the Osmanli for their own ends. It would have been as much as the life of the Committee or its German masters was worth to lay a hand on us, for we clung together like leeches and we were not in the habit of sticking at trifles.\n\n\u201cWell, you may imagine it wasn\u2019t difficult for me to move where I wanted. My dress and the pass-word franked me anywhere. I travelled from Smyrna by the new railway to Panderma on the Marmora, and got there just before Christmas. That was after Anzac and Suvla had been evacuated, but I could hear the guns going hard at Cape Helles. From Panderma I started to cross to Thrace in a coasting steamer. And there an uncommon funny thing happened\u2014I got torpedoed.\n\n\u201cIt must have been about the last effort of a British submarine in those waters. But she got us all right. She gave us ten minutes to take to the boats, and then sent the blighted old packet and a fine cargo of 6-inch shells to the bottom. There weren\u2019t many passengers, so it was easy enough to get ashore in the ship\u2019s boats. The submarine sat on the surface watching us, as we wailed and howled in the true Oriental way, and I saw the captain quite close in the conning-tower. Who do you think it was? Tommy Elliot, who lives on the other side of the hill from me at home.\n\n\u201cI gave Tommy the surprise of his life. As we bumped past him, I started the \u2018Flowers of the Forest\u2019\u2014the old version\u2014on the antique stringed instrument I carried, and I sang the words very plain. Tommy\u2019s eyes bulged out of his head, and he shouted at me in English to know who the devil I was. I replied in the broadest Scots, which no man in the submarine or in our boat could have understood a word of. \u2018Maister Tammy,\u2019 I cried, \u2018what for wad ye skail a dacent tinkler lad intil a cauld sea? I\u2019ll gie ye your kail through the reek for this ploy the next time I forgaither wi\u2019 ye on the tap o\u2019 Caerdon.\u2019\n\n\u201cTommy spotted me in a second. He laughed till he cried, and as we moved off shouted to me in the same language to \u2018pit a stoot hert tae a stey brae\u2019. I hope to Heaven he had the sense not to tell my father, or the old man will have had a fit. He never much approved of my wanderings, and thought I was safely anchored in the battalion.\n\n\u201cWell, to make a long story short, I got to Constantinople, and pretty soon found touch with Blenkiron. The rest you know. And now for business. I have been fairly lucky\u2014but no more, for I haven\u2019t got to the bottom of the thing nor anything like it. But I\u2019ve solved the first of Harry Bullivant\u2019s riddles. I know the meaning of _Kasredin_.\n\n\u201cSir Walter was right, as Blenkiron has told us. There\u2019s a great stirring in Islam, something moving on the face of the waters. They make no secret of it. Those religious revivals come in cycles, and one was due about now. And they are quite clear about the details. A seer has arisen of the blood of the Prophet, who will restore the Khalifate to its old glories and Islam to its old purity. His sayings are everywhere in the Moslem world. All the orthodox believers have them by heart. That is why they are enduring grinding poverty and preposterous taxation, and that is why their young men are rolling up to the armies and dying without complaint in Gallipoli and Transcaucasia. They believe they are on the eve of a great deliverance.\n\n\u201cNow the first thing I found out was that the Young Turks had nothing to do with this. They are unpopular and unorthodox, and no true Turks. But Germany has. How, I don\u2019t know, but I could see quite plainly that in some subtle way Germany was regarded as a collaborator in the movement. It is that belief that is keeping the present regime going. The ordinary Turk loathes the Committee, but he has some queer perverted expectation from Germany. It is not a case of Enver and the rest carrying on their shoulders the unpopular Teuton; it is a case of the Teuton carrying the unpopular Committee. And Germany\u2019s graft is just this and nothing more\u2014that she has some hand in the coming of the new deliverer.\n\n\u201cThey talk about the thing quite openly. It is called the _Ka\u00e1ba-i-hurriyeh_, the Palladium of Liberty. The prophet himself is known as Zimrud\u2014\u2018the Emerald\u2019\u2014and his four ministers are called also after jewels\u2014Sapphire, Ruby, Pearl, and Topaz. You will hear their names as often in the talk of the towns and villages as you will hear the names of generals in England. But no one knew where Zimrud was or when he would reveal himself, though every week came his messages to the faithful. All that I could learn was that he and his followers were coming from the West.\n\n\u201cYou will say, what about _Kasredin_? That puzzled me dreadfully, for no one used the phrase. The Home of the Spirit! It is an obvious cliche, just as in England some new sect might call itself the Church of Christ. Only no one seemed to use it.\n\n\u201cBut by and by I discovered that there was an inner and an outer circle in this mystery. Every creed has an esoteric side which is kept from the common herd. I struck this side in Constantinople. Now there is a very famous Turkish _shaka_ called _Kasredin_, one of those old half-comic miracle plays with an allegorical meaning which they call _orta oyun_, and which take a week to read. That tale tells of the coming of a prophet, and I found that the select of the faith spoke of the new revelation in terms of it. The curious thing is that in that tale the prophet is aided by one of the few women who play much part in the hagiology of Islam. That is the point of the tale, and it is partly a jest, but mainly a religious mystery. The prophet, too, is not called Emerald.\u201d",
    "The car stopped and a tall servant opened the door. The lady was over the threshold before I was at the step. I followed her heavily, the wet squelching from my field-boots. At that moment I noticed that she was very tall.\n\nShe led me through a long corridor to a room where two pillars held lamps in the shape of torches. The place was dark but for their glow, and it was as warm as a hothouse from invisible stoves. I felt soft carpets underfoot, and on the walls hung some tapestry or rug of an amazingly intricate geometrical pattern, but with every strand as rich as jewels. There, between the pillars, she turned and faced me. Her furs were thrown back, and the black mantilla had slipped down to her shoulders.\n\n\u201cI have heard of you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are called Richard Hanau, the American. Why have you come to this land?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo have a share in the campaign,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and I thought I could help out with some business like Mesopotamia.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are on Germany\u2019s side?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d I replied. \u201cWe Americans are supposed to be nootrals, and that means we\u2019re free to choose any side we fancy. I\u2019m for the Kaiser.\u201d\n\nHer cool eyes searched me, but not in suspicion. I could see she wasn\u2019t troubling with the question whether I was speaking the truth. She was sizing me up as a man. I cannot describe that calm appraising look. There was no sex in it, nothing even of that implicit sympathy with which one human being explores the existence of another. I was a chattel, a thing infinitely removed from intimacy. Even so I have myself looked at a horse which I thought of buying, scanning his shoulders and hocks and paces. Even so must the old lords of Constantinople have looked at the slaves which the chances of war brought to their markets, assessing their usefulness for some task or other with no thought of a humanity common to purchased and purchaser. And yet\u2014not quite. This woman\u2019s eyes were weighing me, not for any special duty, but for my essential qualities. I felt that I was under the scrutiny of one who was a connoisseur in human nature.\n\nI see I have written that I knew nothing about women. But every man has in his bones a consciousness of sex. I was shy and perturbed, but horribly fascinated. This slim woman, poised exquisitely like some statue between the pillared lights, with her fair cloud of hair, her long delicate face, and her pale bright eyes, had the glamour of a wild dream. I hated her instinctively, hated her intensely, but I longed to arouse her interest. To be valued coldly by those eyes was an offence to my manhood, and I felt antagonism rising within me. I am a strong fellow, well set up, and rather above the average height, and my irritation stiffened me from heel to crown. I flung my head back and gave her cool glance for cool glance, pride against pride.\n\nOnce, I remember, a doctor on board ship who dabbled in hypnotism told me that I was the most unsympathetic person he had ever struck. He said I was about as good a mesmeric subject as Table Mountain. Suddenly I began to realize that this woman was trying to cast some spell over me. The eyes grew large and luminous, and I was conscious for just an instant of some will battling to subject mine. I was aware, too, in the same moment of a strange scent which recalled that wild hour in Kuprasso\u2019s garden-house. It passed quickly, and for a second her eyes drooped. I seemed to read in them failure, and yet a kind of satisfaction, too, as if they had found more in me than they expected.\n\n\u201cWhat life have you led?\u201d the soft voice was saying.\n\nI was able to answer quite naturally, rather to my surprise. \u201cI have been a mining engineer up and down the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have faced danger many times?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have faced danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have fought with men in battles?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have fought in battles.\u201d\n\nHer bosom rose and fell in a kind of sigh. A smile\u2014a very beautiful thing\u2014flitted over her face. She gave me her hand. \u201cThe horses are at the door now,\u201d she said, \u201cand your servant is with them. One of my people will guide you to the city.\u201d\n\nShe turned away and passed out of the circle of light into the darkness beyond ...",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve often regretted,\u201d said Blenkiron, \u201cthat miracles have left off happening. For I reckon,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat it wants a good old-fashioned copper-bottomed miracle to get us out of this fix. It\u2019s plumb against all my principles. I\u2019ve spent my life using the talents God gave me to keep things from getting to the point of rude violence, and so far I\u2019ve succeeded. But now you come along, Major, and you hustle a respectable middle-aged citizen into an aboriginal mix-up. It\u2019s mighty indelicate. I reckon the next move is up to you, for I\u2019m no good at the housebreaking stunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more am I,\u201d I answered; \u201cbut I\u2019m hanged if I\u2019ll chuck up the sponge. Sandy\u2019s somewhere outside, and he\u2019s got a hefty crowd at his heels.\u201d\n\nI simply could not feel the despair which by every law of common sense was due to the case. The guns had intoxicated me. I could still hear their deep voices, though yards of wood and stone separated us from the upper air.\n\nWhat vexed us most was our hunger. Barring a few mouthfuls on the road we had eaten nothing since the morning, and as our diet for the past days had not been generous we had some leeway to make up. Stumm had never looked near us since we were shoved into the car. We had been brought to some kind of house and bundled into a place like a wine-cellar. It was pitch dark, and after feeling round the walls, first on my feet and then on Peter\u2019s back, I decided that there were no windows. It must have been lit and ventilated by some lattice in the ceiling. There was not a stick of furniture in the place: nothing but a damp earth floor and bare stone sides. The door was a relic of the Iron Age, and I could hear the paces of a sentry outside it.\n\nWhen things get to the pass that nothing you can do can better them, the only thing is to live for the moment. All three of us sought in sleep a refuge from our empty stomachs. The floor was the poorest kind of bed, but we rolled up our coats for pillows and made the best of it. Soon I knew by Peter\u2019s regular breathing that he was asleep, and I presently followed him ...\n\nI was awakened by a pressure below my left ear. I thought it was Peter, for it is the old hunter\u2019s trick of waking a man so that he makes no noise. But another voice spoke. It told me that there was no time to lose and to rise and follow, and the voice was the voice of Hussin.\n\nPeter was awake, and we stirred Blenkiron out of heavy slumber. We were bidden take off our boots and hang them by their laces round our necks as country boys do when they want to go barefoot. Then we tiptoed to the door, which was ajar.\n\nOutside was a passage with a flight of steps at one end which led to the open air. On these steps lay a faint shine of starlight, and by its help I saw a man huddled up at the foot of them. It was our sentry, neatly and scientifically gagged and tied up.\n\nThe steps brought us to a little courtyard about which the walls of the houses rose like cliffs. We halted while Hussin listened intently. Apparently the coast was clear and our guide led us to one side, which was clothed by a stout wooden trellis. Once it may have supported fig-trees, but now the plants were dead and only withered tendrils and rotten stumps remained.\n\nIt was child\u2019s play for Peter and me to go up that trellis, but it was the deuce and all for Blenkiron. He was in poor condition and puffed like a grampus, and he seemed to have no sort of head for heights. But he was as game as a buffalo, and started in gallantly till his arms gave out and he fairly stuck. So Peter and I went up on each side of him, taking an arm apiece, as I had once seen done to a man with vertigo in the Kloof Chimney on Table Mountain. I was mighty thankful when I got him panting on the top and Hussin had shinned up beside us.\n\nWe crawled along a broadish wall, with an inch or two of powdery snow on it, and then up a sloping buttress on to the flat roof of the house. It was a miserable business for Blenkiron, who would certainly have fallen if he could have seen what was below him, and Peter and I had to stand to attention all the time. Then began a more difficult job. Hussin pointed out a ledge which took us past a stack of chimneys to another building slightly lower, this being the route he fancied. At that I sat down resolutely and put on my boots, and the others followed. Frost-bitten feet would be a poor asset in this kind of travelling.\n\nIt was a bad step for Blenkiron, and we only got him past it by Peter and I spread-eagling ourselves against the wall and passing him in front of us with his face towards us. We had no grip, and if he had stumbled we should all three have been in the courtyard. But we got it over, and dropped as softly as possible on to the roof of the next house. Hussin had his finger on his lips, and I soon saw why. For there was a lighted window in the wall we had descended.\n\nSome imp prompted me to wait behind and explore. The others followed Hussin and were soon at the far end of the roof, where a kind of wooden pavilion broke the line, while I tried to get a look inside. The window was curtained, and had two folding sashes which clasped in the middle. Through a gap in the curtain I saw a little lamp-lit room and a big man sitting at a table littered with papers.\n\nI watched him, fascinated, as he turned to consult some document and made a marking on the map before him. Then he suddenly rose, stretched himself, cast a glance at the window, and went out of the room, making a great clatter in descending the wooden staircase. He left the door ajar and the lamp burning.",
    "I found them shivering in the roof pavilion. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move pretty fast,\u201d I said, \u201cfor I\u2019ve just been burgling old Stumm\u2019s private cabinet. Hussin, my lad, d\u2019you hear that? They may be after us any moment, so I pray Heaven we soon strike better going.\u201d\n\nHussin understood. He led us at a smart pace from one roof to another, for here they were all of the same height, and only low parapets and screens divided them. We never saw a soul, for a winter\u2019s night is not the time you choose to saunter on your housetop. I kept my ears open for trouble behind us, and in about five minutes I heard it. A riot of voices broke out, with one louder than the rest, and, looking back, I saw lanterns waving. Stumm had realized his loss and found the tracks of the thief.\n\nHussin gave one glance behind and then hurried us on at break-neck pace, with old Blenkiron gasping and stumbling. The shouts behind us grew louder, as if some eye quicker than the rest had caught our movement in the starlit darkness. It was very evident that if they kept up the chase we should be caught, for Blenkiron was about as useful on a roof as a hippo.\n\nPresently we came to a big drop, with a kind of ladder down it, and at the foot a shallow ledge running to the left into a pit of darkness. Hussin gripped my arm and pointed down it. \u201cFollow it,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand you will reach a roof which spans a street. Cross it, and on the other side is a mosque. Turn to the right there and you will find easy going for fifty metres, well screened from the higher roofs. For Allah\u2019s sake keep in the shelter of the screen. Somewhere there I will join you.\u201d\n\nHe hurried us along the ledge for a bit and then went back, and with snow from the corners covered up our tracks. After that he went straight on himself, taking strange short steps like a bird. I saw his game. He wanted to lead our pursuers after him, and he had to multiply the tracks and trust to Stumm\u2019s fellows not spotting that they all were made by one man.\n\nBut I had quite enough to think of in getting Blenkiron along that ledge. He was pretty nearly foundered, he was in a sweat of terror, and as a matter of fact he was taking one of the biggest risks of his life, for we had no rope and his neck depended on himself. I could hear him invoking some unknown deity called Holy Mike. But he ventured gallantly, and we got to the roof which ran across the street. That was easier, though ticklish enough, but it was no joke skirting the cupola of that infernal mosque. At last we found the parapet and breathed more freely, for we were now under shelter from the direction of danger. I spared a moment to look round, and thirty yards off, across the street, I saw a weird spectacle.\n\nThe hunt was proceeding along the roofs parallel to the one we were lodged on. I saw the flicker of the lanterns, waved up and down as the bearers slipped in the snow, and I heard their cries like hounds on a trail. Stumm was not among them: he had not the shape for that sort of business. They passed us and continued to our left, now hid by a jutting chimney, now clear to view against the sky line. The roofs they were on were perhaps six feet higher than ours, so even from our shelter we could mark their course. If Hussin were going to be hunted across Erzerum it was a bad look-out for us, for I hadn\u2019t the foggiest notion where we were or where we were going to.\n\nBut as we watched we saw something more. The wavering lanterns were now three or four hundred yards away, but on the roofs just opposite us across the street there appeared a man\u2019s figure. I thought it was one of the hunters, and we all crouched lower, and then I recognized the lean agility of Hussin. He must have doubled back, keeping in the dusk to the left of the pursuit, and taking big risks in the open places. But there he was now, exactly in front of us, and separated only by the width of the narrow street.\n\nHe took a step backward, gathered himself for a spring, and leaped clean over the gap. Like a cat he lighted on the parapet above us, and stumbled forward with the impetus right on our heads.\n\n\u201cWe are safe for the moment,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbut when they miss me they will return. We must make good haste.\u201d\n\nThe next half-hour was a maze of twists and turns, slipping down icy roofs and climbing icier chimney-stacks. The stir of the city had gone, and from the black streets below came scarcely a sound. But always the great tattoo of guns beat in the east. Gradually we descended to a lower level, till we emerged on the top of a shed in a courtyard. Hussin gave an odd sort of cry, like a demented owl, and something began to stir below us.\n\n\nIt was a big covered wagon, full of bundles of forage, and drawn by four mules. As we descended from the shed into the frozen litter of the yard, a man came out of the shade and spoke low to Hussin. Peter and I lifted Blenkiron into the cart, and scrambled in beside him, and I never felt anything more blessed than the warmth and softness of that place after the frosty roofs. I had forgotten all about my hunger, and only yearned for sleep. Presently the wagon moved out of the courtyard into the dark streets.\n\nThen Blenkiron began to laugh, a deep internal rumble which shook him violently and brought down a heap of forage on his head. I thought it was hysterics, the relief from the tension of the past hour. But it wasn\u2019t. His body might be out of training, but there was never anything the matter with his nerves. He was consumed with honest merriment.",
    "Sandy stood there, but a new Sandy who made Blenkiron and me jump to our feet. The pelts and skin-cap had gone, and he wore instead a long linen tunic clasped at the waist by a broad girdle. A strange green turban adorned his head, and as he pushed it back I saw that his hair had been shaved. He looked like some acolyte\u2014a weary acolyte, for there was no spring in his walk or nerve in his carriage. He dropped numbly on the divan and laid his head in his hands. The lantern showed his haggard eyes with dark lines beneath them.\n\n\u201cGood God, old man, have you been sick?\u201d I cried.\n\n\u201cNot sick,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cMy body is right enough, but the last few days I have been living in hell.\u201d\n\nBlenkiron nodded sympathetically. That was how he himself would have described the company of the lady.\n\nI marched across to him and gripped both his wrists.\n\n\u201cLook at me,\u201d I said, \u201cstraight in the eyes.\u201d\n\nHis eyes were like a sleep-walker\u2019s, unwinking, unseeing. \u201cGreat heavens, man, you\u2019ve been drugged!\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cDrugged,\u201d he cried, with a weary laugh. \u201cYes, I have been drugged, but not by any physic. No one has been doctoring my food. But you can\u2019t go through hell without getting your eyes red-hot.\u201d\n\nI kept my grip on his wrists. \u201cTake your time, old chap, and tell us about it. Blenkiron and I are here, and old Peter\u2019s on the roof not far off. We\u2019ll look after you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does me good to hear your voice, Dick,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reminds me of clean, honest things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come back, never fear. We\u2019re at the last lap now. One more spurt and it\u2019s over. You\u2019ve got to tell me what the new snag is. Is it that woman?\u201d\n\nHe shivered like a frightened colt. \u201cWoman!\u201d he cried. \u201cDoes a woman drag a man through the nether-pit? She\u2019s a she-devil. Oh, it isn\u2019t madness that\u2019s wrong with her. She\u2019s as sane as you and as cool as Blenkiron. Her life is an infernal game of chess, and she plays with souls for pawns. She is evil\u2014evil\u2014evil.\u201d And once more he buried his head in his hands.\n\nIt was Blenkiron who brought sense into this hectic atmosphere. His slow, beloved drawl was an antiseptic against nerves.\n\n\u201cSay, boy,\u201d he said, \u201cI feel just like you about the lady. But our job is not to investigate her character. Her Maker will do that good and sure some day. We\u2019ve got to figure how to circumvent her, and for that you\u2019ve got to tell us what exactly\u2019s been occurring since we parted company.\u201d\n\nSandy pulled himself together with a great effort.\n\n\u201cGreenmantle died that night I saw you. We buried him secretly by her order in the garden of the villa. Then came the trouble about his successor ... The four Ministers would be no party to a swindle. They were honest men, and vowed that their task now was to make a tomb for their master and pray for the rest of their days at his shrine. They were as immovable as a granite hill and she knew it.... Then they, too, died.\u201d\n\n\u201cMurdered?\u201d I gasped.\n\n\u201cMurdered ... all four in one morning. I do not know how, but I helped to bury them. Oh, she had Germans and Kurds to do her foul work, but their hands were clean compared to hers. Pity me, Dick, for I have seen honesty and virtue put to the shambles and have abetted the deed when it was done. It will haunt me to my dying day.\u201d\n\nI did not stop to console him, for my mind was on fire with his news.\n\n\u201cThen the prophet is gone, and the humbug is over,\u201d I cried.\n\n\u201cThe prophet still lives. She has found a successor.\u201d\n\nHe stood up in his linen tunic.\n\n\u201cWhy do I wear these clothes? Because I am Greenmantle. I am the _Ka\u00e1ba-i-hurriyeh_ for all Islam. In three days\u2019 time I will reveal myself to my people and wear on my breast the green ephod of the prophet.\u201d\n\nHe broke off with an hysterical laugh. \u201cOnly you see, I won\u2019t. I will cut my throat first.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheer up!\u201d said Blenkiron soothingly. \u201cWe\u2019ll find some prettier way than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way,\u201d he said; \u201cno way but death. We\u2019re done for, all of us. Hussin got you out of Stumm\u2019s clutches, but you\u2019re in danger every moment. At the best you have three days, and then you, too, will be dead.\u201d\n\nI had no words to reply. This change in the bold and unshakeable Sandy took my breath away.\n\n\u201cShe made me her accomplice,\u201d he went on. \u201cI should have killed her on the graves of those innocent men. But instead I did all she asked and joined in her game ... She was very candid, you know ... She cares no more than Enver for the faith of Islam. She can laugh at it. But she has her own dreams, and they consume her as a saint is consumed by his devotion. She has told me them, and if the day in the garden was hell, the days since have been the innermost fires of Tophet. I think\u2014it is horrible to say it\u2014that she has got some kind of crazy liking for me. When we have reclaimed the East I am to be by her side when she rides on her milk-white horse into Jerusalem ... And there have been moments\u2014only moments, I swear to God\u2014when I have been fired myself by her madness ...\u201d\n\nSandy\u2019s figure seemed to shrink and his voice grew shrill and wild. It was too much for Blenkiron. He indulged in a torrent of blasphemy such as I believe had never before passed his lips.",
    "He climbed on the roof and shinned down the broken bricks of the outer wall. The outbuilding we were lodged in abutted on a road, and was outside the proper _enceinte_ of the house. At ordinary times I have no doubt there were sentries, but Sandy and Hussin had probably managed to clear them off this end for a little. Anyhow he saw nobody as he crossed the road and dived into the snowy fields.\n\nHe knew very well that he must do the job in the twelve hours of darkness ahead of him. The immediate front of a battle is a bit too public for anyone to lie hidden in by day, especially when two or three feet of snow make everything kenspeckle. Now hurry in a job of this kind was abhorrent to Peter\u2019s soul, for, like all Boers, his tastes were for slowness and sureness, though he could hustle fast enough when haste was needed. As he pushed through the winter fields he reckoned up the things in his favour, and found the only one the dirty weather. There was a high, gusty wind, blowing scuds of snow but never coming to any great fall. The frost had gone, and the lying snow was as soft as butter. That was all to the good, he thought, for a clear, hard night would have been the devil.\n\nThe first bit was through farmlands, which were seamed with little snow-filled water-furrows. Now and then would come a house and a patch of fruit trees, but there was nobody abroad. The roads were crowded enough, but Peter had no use for roads. I can picture him swinging along with his bent back, stopping every now and then to sniff and listen, alert for the foreknowledge of danger. When he chose he could cover country like an antelope.\n\nSoon he struck a big road full of transport. It was the road from Erzerum to the Palantuken pass, and he waited his chance and crossed it. After that the ground grew rough with boulders and patches of thorn-trees, splendid cover where he could move fast without worrying. Then he was pulled up suddenly on the bank of a river. The map had warned him of it, but not that it would be so big.\n\nIt was a torrent swollen with melting snow and rains in the hills, and it was running fifty yards wide. Peter thought he could have swum it, but he was very averse to a drenching. \u201cA wet man makes too much noise,\u201d he said, and besides, there was the off-chance that the current would be too much for him. So he moved up stream to look for a bridge.\n\nIn ten minutes he found one, a new-made thing of trestles, broad enough to take transport wagons. It was guarded, for he heard the tramp of a sentry, and as he pulled himself up the bank he observed a couple of long wooden huts, obviously some kind of billets. These were on the near side of the stream, about a dozen yards from the bridge. A door stood open and a light showed in it, and from within came the sound of voices.... Peter had a sense of hearing like a wild animal, and he could detect even from the confused gabble that the voices were German.\n\nAs he lay and listened someone came over the bridge. It was an officer, for the sentry saluted. The man disappeared in one of the huts. Peter had struck the billets and repairing shop of a squad of German sappers.\n\nHe was just going ruefully to retrace his steps and try to find a good place to swim the stream when it struck him that the officer who had passed him wore clothes very like his own. He, too, had had a grey sweater and a Balaclava helmet, for even a German officer ceases to be dressy on a mid-winter\u2019s night in Anatolia. The idea came to Peter to walk boldly across the bridge and trust to the sentry not seeing the difference.\n\nHe slipped round a corner of the hut and marched down the road. The sentry was now at the far end, which was lucky, for if the worst came to the worst he could throttle him. Peter, mimicking the stiff German walk, swung past him, his head down as if to protect him from the wind.\n\nThe man saluted. He did more, for he offered conversation. The officer must have been a genial soul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rough night, Captain,\u201d he said in German. \u201cThe wagons are late. Pray God, Michael hasn\u2019t got a shell in his lot. They\u2019ve begun putting over some big ones.\u201d\n\nPeter grunted good night in German and strode on. He was just leaving the road when he heard a great halloo behind him.\n\nThe real officer must have appeared on his heels, and the sentry\u2019s doubts had been stirred. A whistle was blown, and, looking back, Peter saw lanterns waving in the gale. They were coming out to look for the duplicate.\n\nHe stood still for a second, and noticed the lights spreading out south of the road. He was just about to dive off it on the north side when he was aware of a difficulty. On that side a steep bank fell to a ditch, and the bank beyond bounded a big flood. He could see the dull ruffle of the water under the wind.\n\nOn the road itself he would soon be caught; south of it the search was beginning; and the ditch itself was no place to hide, for he saw a lantern moving up it. Peter dropped into it all the same and made a plan. The side below the road was a little undercut and very steep. He resolved to plaster himself against it, for he would be hidden from the road, and a searcher in the ditch would not be likely to explore the unbroken sides. It was always a maxim of Peter\u2019s that the best hiding-place was the worst, the least obvious to the minds of those who were looking for you.\n\nHe waited until the lights both in the road and the ditch came nearer, and then he gripped the edge with his left hand, where some stones gave him purchase, dug the toes of his boots into the wet soil and stuck like a limpet. It needed some strength to keep the position for long, but the muscles of his arms and legs were like whipcord.\n\n\nThe searcher in the ditch soon got tired, for the place was very wet, and joined his comrades on the road. They came along, running, flashing the lanterns into the trench, and exploring all the immediate countryside.  Then rose a noise of wheels and horses from the opposite direction. Michael and the delayed wagons were approaching. They dashed up at a great pace, driven wildly, and for one horrid second Peter thought they were going to spill into the ditch at the very spot where he was concealed. The wheels passed so close to the edge that they almost grazed his fingers. Somebody shouted an order and they pulled up a yard or two nearer the bridge. The others came up and there was a consultation."

  "Talbot Mundy -- King--of the Khyber Rifles: A Romance of Adventure": [
    "The men who govern India--more power to them and her!--are few. Those who stand in their way and pretend to help them with a flood of words are a host. And from the host goes up an endless cry that India is the home of thugs, and of three hundred million hungry ones.\n\nThe men who know--and Athelstan King might claim to know a little--answer that she is the original home of chivalry and the modern mistress of as many decent, gallant, native gentlemen as ever graced a page of history.\n\nThe charge has seen the light in print that India--well-spring of plague and sudden death and money-lenders--has sold her soul to twenty succeeding conquerors in turn.\n\nAthelstan King and a hundred like him whom India has picked from British stock and taught, can answer truly that she has won it back again from each by very purity of purpose.\n\nSo when the world war broke the world was destined to be surprised on India's account. The Red Sea, full of racing transports crowded with dark-skinned gentlemen, whose one prayer was that the war might not be over before they should have struck a blow for Britain, was the Indian army's answer to the press.\n\nThe rest of India paid its taxes and contributed and muzzled itself and set to work to make supplies. For they understand in India, almost as nowhere else, the meaning of such old-fashioned words as gratitude and honor; and of such platitudes as, \u201cGive and it shall be given unto you.\u201d\n\nMore than one nation was deeply shocked by India's answer to \u201cpractises\u201d that had extended over years. But there were men in India who learned to love India long ago with that love that casts out fear, who knew exactly what was going to happen and could therefore afford to wait for orders instead of running round in rings.\n\nAthelstan King, for instance, nothing yet but a captain unattached, sat in meagerly furnished quarters with his heels on a table. He is not a doctor, yet he read a book on surgery, and when he went over to the club he carried the book under his arm and continued to read it there. He is considered a rotten conversationalist, and he did nothing at the club to improve his reputation.\n\n\u201cMan alive--get a move on!\u201d gasped a wondering senior, accepting a cigar. Nobody knows where he gets those long, strong, black cheroots, and nobody ever refuses one.\n\n\u201cThanks--got a book to read,\u201d said King.\n\n\u201cYou ass! Wake up and grab the best thing in sight, as a stepping stone to something better! Wake up and worry!\u201d\n\nKing grinned. You have to when you don't agree with a senior officer, for the army is like a school in many more ways than one.\n\n\u201cHelp yourself, sir! I'll take the job that's left when the scramble's over. Something good's sure to be overlooked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhite feather? Laziness? Dark Horse?\u201d the major wondered. Then he hurried away to write telegrams, because a belief thrives in the early days of any war that influence can make or break a man's chances. In the other room where the telegraph blanks were littered in confusion all about the floor, he ran into a crony whose chief sore point was Athelstan King, loathing him as some men loathe pickles or sardines, for no real reason whatever, except that they are what they are.\n\n\u201cSaw you talking to King,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes. Can't make him out. Rum fellow!\u201d\n\n\u201cRum? Huh! Trouble is he's seventh of his family in succession to serve in India. She has seeped into him and pickled his heritage. He's a believer in Kismet crossed on to Opportunity. Not sure he doesn't pray to Allah on the sly! Hopeless case.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite!\u201d\n\nSo they all sent telegrams and forgot King who sat and smoked and read about surgery; and before he had nearly finished one box of cheroots a general at Peshawur wiped a bald red skull and sent him an urgent telegram.\n\n\u201cCome at once!\u201d it said simply.\n\nKing was at Lahore, but miles don't matter when the dogs of war are loosed. The right man goes to the right place at the exact right time then, and the fool goes to the wall. In that one respect war is better than some kinds of peace.\n\nIn the train on the way to Peshawur he did not talk any more volubly, and a fellow traveler, studying him from the opposite corner of the stifling compartment, catalogued him as \u201cquite an ordinary man.\u201d But he was of the Public Works Department, which is sorrowfully underpaid and wears emotions on its sleeve for policy's sake, believing of course that all the rest of the world should do the same.\n\n\u201cDon't you think we're bound in honor to go to Belgium's aid?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan you see any way out of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven't looked for one,\u201d said King.\n\n\u201cBut don't you think--\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said King. \u201cI hardly ever think. I'm in the army, don't you know, and don't have to. What's the use of doing somebody else's work?\u201d\n\n\u201cRotter!\u201d thought the P.W.D. man, almost aloud; but King was not troubled by any further forced conversation. Consequently he reached Peshawur comfortable, in spite of the heat. And his genial manner of saluting the full-general who met him with a dog-cart at Peshawur station was something scandalous.\n\n\u201cIs he a lunatic or a relative of royalty?\u201d the P.W.D. man wondered.",
    "After many prickly-hot, interminable, jolting hours the train drew up at Rawal-Pindi station. Instantly King was on his feet with his tunic on, and he was out on the blazing hot platform before the train's motion had quite ceased.\n\nHe began to walk up and down, not elbowing but percolating through the crowd, missing nothing worth noticing in all the hot kaleidoscope and seeming to find new amusement at every turn. It was not in the least astonishing that a well-dressed native should address him presently, for he looked genial enough to be asked to hold a baby. King himself did not seem surprised at all. Far from it; he looked pleased.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, sir,\u201d said the man in glib babu English. \u201cI am seeking Captain King sahib, for whom my brother is veree anxious to be servant. Can you kindlee tell me, sir, where I could find Captain King sahib?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d King answered him. He looked glad to be of help. \u201cAre you traveling on this train?\u201d\n\nThe question sounded like politeness welling from the lips of unsuspicion.\n\n\u201cYes, sir. I am traveling from this place where I have spent a few days, to Bombay, where my business is.\n\n\u201cHow did you know King sahib is on the train?\u201d King asked him, smiling so genially that even the police could not have charged him with more than curiosity.\n\n\u201cBy telegram, sir. My brother had the misfortune to miss Captain King sahib at Peshawur and therefore sent a telegram to me asking me to do what I can at an interview.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said King. \u201cI see.\u201d And judging by the sparkle in his eyes as he looked away he could see a lot. But the native could not see his eyes at that instant, although he tried to.\n\nHe looked back at the train, giving the man a good chance to study his face in profile.\n\n\u201cOh, thank you, sir!\u201d said the native oilily. \u201cYou are most kind! I am your humble servant, sir!\u201d\n\nKing nodded good-by to him, his dark eyes in the shadow of the khaki helmet seeming scarcely interested any longer.\n\n\u201cCouldn't you find another berth?\u201d Hyde asked him angrily when he stepped back into the compartment.\n\n\u201cWhat were you out there looking for?\u201d\n\nKing smiled back at him blandly.\n\n\u201cI think there are railway thieves on the train,\u201d he announced without any effort at relevance. He might not have heard the question.\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think so?\u201d\n\n\u201cObservation, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Then if you've seen thieves, why didn't you have 'em arrested? You were precious free with that authority of yours on Peshawur platform!\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you'd care to take the responsibility, sir? Let me point out one of them.\u201d\n\nFull of grudging curiosity Hyde came to stand by him, and King stepped back just as the train began to move.\n\n\u201cThat man, sir--over there--no, beyond him--there!\u201d\n\nHyde thrust head and shoulders through the window, and a well-dressed native with one foot on the running-board at the back end of the train took a long steady stare at him before jumping in and slamming the door of a third-class carriage.\n\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d demanded Hyde impatiently.\n\n\u201cI don't see him now, sir!\u201d\n\nHyde snorted and returned to his seat in the silence of unspeakable scorn. But presently he opened a suitcase and drew out a repeating pistol which he cocked carefully and stowed beneath his pillow; not at all a contemptible move, because the Indian railway thief is the most resourceful specialist in the world. But King took no overt precautions of any kind.\n\nAfter more interminable hours night shut down on them, red-hot, black-dark, mesmerically subdivided into seconds by the thump of carriage wheels and lit at intervals by showers of sparks from the gasping engine. The din of Babel rode behind the first-class carriages, for all the natives in the packed third-class talked all together. (In India, when one has spent a fortune on a third-class ticket, one proceeds to enjoy the ride.) The train was a Beast out of Revelation, wallowing in noise.\n\nBut after other, hotter hours the talking ceased. Then King, strangely without kicking off his shoes, drew a sheet up over his shoulders. On the opposite berth Hyde covered his head, to keep dust out of his hair, and presently King heard him begin to snore gently. Then, very carefully he adjusted his own position so that his profile lay outlined in the dim light from the gas lamp in the roof. He might almost have been waiting to be shaved.\n\nThe stuffiness increased to a degree that is sometimes preached in Christian churches as belonging to a sulphurous sphere beyond the grave. Yet he did not move a muscle. It was long after midnight when his vigil was rewarded by a slight sound at the door. From that instant his eyes were on the watch, under dark of closed lashes; but his even breathing was that of the seventh stage of sleep that knows no dreams.\n\nA click of the door-latch heralded the appearance of a hand. With skill, of the sort that only special training can develop, a man in native dress insinuated himself into the carriage without making another sound of any kind. King's ears are part of the equipment for his exacting business, but he could not hear the door click shut again.\n\nFor about five minutes, while the train swayed head-long into Indian darkness, the man stood listening and watching King's face. He stood so near that King recognized him for the one who had accosted him on Rawal-Pindi platform. And he could see the outline of the knife-hilt that the man's fingers clutched underneath his shirt.",
    "It was a musty smelling entrance, so dark that to see was scarcely possible after the hot glare outside. Dimly King made out Rewa Gunga mounting stairs to the left and followed him. The stairs wound backward and forward on themselves four times, growing scarcely any lighter as they ascended, until, when he guessed himself two stories at least above road level, there was a sudden blaze of reflected light and he blinked at more mirrors than he could count. They had been swung on hinges suddenly to throw the light full in his face.\n\nThere were curtains reflected in each mirror, and little glowing lamps, so cunningly arranged that it was not possible to guess which were real and which were not. Rewa Gunga offered no explanation, but stood watching with quiet amusement. He seemed to expect King to take a chance and go forward, but if he did he reckoned without his guest. King stood still.\n\nThen suddenly, as if she had done it a thousand times before and surprised a thousand people, a little nut-brown maid parted the middle pair of curtains and said \u201cSalaam!\u201d smiling with teeth that were as white as porcelain. All the other curtains parted too, so that the whereabouts of the door might still have been in doubt had she not spoken and so distinguished herself from her reflections. King looked scarcely interested and not at all disturbed.\n\nBalked of his amusement, Rewa Gunga hurried past him, thrusting the little maid aside, and led the way. King followed him into a long room, whose walls were hung with richer silks than any he remembered to have seen. In a great wide window to one side some twenty women began at once to make flute music.\n\nSilken punkahs swung from chains, wafting back and forth a cloud of sandalwood smoke that veiled the whole scene in mysterious, scented mist. Through the open window came the splash of a fountain and the chattering of birds, and the branch of a feathery tree drooped near by. It seemed that the long white wall below was that of Yasmini's garden.\n\n\u201cBe welcome!\u201d laughed Rewa Gunga; \u201cI am to do the honors, since she is not here. Be seated, sahib.\u201d\n\nKing chose a divan at the room's farthest end, near tall curtains that led into rooms beyond. He turned his back toward the reason for his choice. On a little ivory-inlaid ebony table about ten feet away lay a knife, that was almost the exact duplicate of the one inside his shirt. Bronze knives of ancient date, with golden handles carved to represent a woman dancing, are rare. The ability to seem not to notice incriminating evidence is rarer still--rarest of all when under the eyes of a native of India, for cats and hawks are dullards by comparison to them. But King saw the knife, yet did not seem to see it.\n\nThere was nothing there calculated to set an Englishman at ease. In spite of the Rangar's casual manner, Yasmini's reception room felt like the antechamber to another world, where mystery is atmosphere and ordinary air to breathe is not at all. He could sense hushed expectancy on every side--could feel the eyes of many women fixed on him--and began to draw on his guard as a fighting man draws on armor. There and then he deliberately set himself to resist mesmerism, which is the East's chief weapon.\n\nRewa Gunga, perfectly at home, sprawled leisurely, along a cushioned couch with a grace that the West has not learned yet; but King did not make the mistake of trusting him any better for his easy manners, and his eyes sought swiftly for some unrhythmic, unplanned thing on which to rest, that he might save himself by a sort of mental leverage.\n\nGlancing along the wall that faced the big window, he noticed for the first time a huge Afridi, who sat on a stool and leaned back against the silken hangings with arms folded.\n\n\u201cWho is that man?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cHe? Oh, he is a savage--just a big savage,\u201d said Rewa Gunga, looking vaguely annoyed.\n\n\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d\n\nHe did not dare let go of this chance side-issue. He knew that Rewa Gunga wished him to talk of Yasmini and to ask questions about her, and that if he succumbed to that temptation all his self-control would be cunningly sapped away from him until his secrets, and his very senses, belonged to some one else.\n\n\u201cWhat is he doing here?\u201d he insisted.\n\n\u201cHe? Oh, he does nothing. He waits,\u201d purred the Rangar. \u201cHe is to be your body-servant on your journey to the North. He is nothing--nobody at all!--except that he is to be trusted utterly because he loves Yasmini. He is Obedience! A big obedient fool! Let him be!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said King. \u201cIf he's to be my man I'll speak to him!\u201d\n\nHe felt himself winning. Already the spell of the room was lifting, and he no longer felt the cloud of sandalwood smoke like a veil across his brain.",
    "\u201cHere's wishing you luck!\u201d said King. \u201cIt's time to go, sir.\u201d\n\nHe rose, and Courtenay walked with him to where his party waited in the dark, chilled by the cold wind whistling down the Khyber. Rewa Gunga sat, mounted, at their head, and close to him his personal servant rode another horse. Behind them were the mules, and then in a cluster, each with a load of some sort on his head, were the thirty prisoners, and Ismail took charge of them officiously. Darya Khan, the man who had brought the letter down the Pass, kept close to Ismail.\n\n\u201cAre you armed?\u201d King asked, as soon as he could see the whites of the Rangar's eyes through the gloom.\n\n\u201cYou jolly well bet I am!\u201d the Rangar laughed.\n\nKing mounted, and Courtenay shook hands; then he went to Rewa Gunga's side and shook hands with him, too.\n\n\u201cGood-by!\u201d called King.\n\n\u201cGood-by and good luck!\u201d\n\n\u201cForward! March!\u201d King ordered, and the little procession started.\n\n\u201cOh, men of the 'Hills,' ye look like ghosts--like graveyard ghosts!\u201d jeered Courtenay, as they all filed past him. \u201cYe look like dead men, going to be judged!\u201d\n\nNobody answered. They strode behind the horses, with the swift silent strides of men who are going home to the \u201cHills\u201d; but even they, born in the \u201cHills\u201d' and knowing them as a wolf-pack knows its hunting-ground, were awed by the gloom of Khyber-mouth ahead. King's voice was the first to break the silence, and he did not speak until Courtenay was out of ear-shot. Then:\n\n\u201cMen of the 'Hills'!\u201d he called. \u201cKuch dar nahin hai!\u201d\n\n\u201cNahin hai! Hah!\u201d shouted Ismail. \u201cSo speaks a man! Hear that, ye mountain folk! He says, 'There is no such thing as fear!'\u201d\n\nIn his place in the lead, King whistled softly to himself; but he drew an automatic pistol from its place beneath his armpit and transferred it to a readier position.\n\nFear or no fear, Khyber-mouth is haunted after dark by the men whose blood-feuds are too reeking raw to let them dare go home and for whom the British hangman very likely waits a mile or two farther south. It is one of the few places in the world where a pistol is better than a thick stick.\n\nBoulder, crag and loose rock faded into gloom behind; in front on both hands ragged hillsides were beginning to close in; and the wind, whose home is in Allah's refuse heap, whistled as it searched busily among the black ravines. Then presently the shadow of the thousand-foot-high Khyber walls began to cover them, and King drew rein to count them all and let them close up. To have let them straggle after that point would be tantamount to murder probably.\n\n\u201cRide last!\u201d he ordered Rewa Gunga. \u201cYou've got the only other pistol, haven't you?\u201d\n\nDarya Khan, who had brought the letter, had a rifle; so King gave him a roving commission on the right flank.\n\nThey moved on again after five minutes, in the same deep silence, looking like ghosts in search of somebody to ferry them across the Styx. Only the glow of King's cheroot, and the lesser, quicker fire of Rewa Gunga's cigarette, betrayed humanity, except that once or twice King's horse would put a foot wrong and be spoken to.\n\n\n\u201cHold up!\u201d\n\nBut from five or ten yards away that might have been a new note in the gaining wind or even nothing.\n\nAfter a while King's cheroot went out, and he threw it away. A little later Rewa Gunga threw away his cigarette. After that, the veriest five-year-old among the Zakka Khels, watching sleepless over the rim of some stone watch-tower, could have taken oath that the Khyber's unburied dead were prowling in search of empty graves. Probably their uncanny silence was their best protection; but Rewa Gunga chose to break it after a time.\n\n\u201cKing sahib!\u201d he called softly, repeating it louder and more loudly until King heard him. \u201cSlowly! Not so fast!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nKing did not check speed by a fraction, but the Rangar legged his mare into a canter and forced him to pull out to the left of the track and make room.\n\n\u201cBecause, sahib, there are men among those boulders, and to go too fast is to make them think you are afraid! To seem afraid is to invite attack! Can we defend ourselves, with three firearms between us? Look! What was that?\u201d\n\nThey were at the point where the road begins to lead up-hill, westward, leaving the bed of a ravine and ascending to join the highway built by British engineers. Below, to left and right, was pit-mouth gloom, shadows amid shadows, full of eerie whisperings, and King felt the short hair on his neck begin to rise.\n\nSo he urged his horse forward, because what Rewa Gunga said is true. There is only one surer key to trouble in the Khyber than to seem afraid--and that is to be afraid. And to have sat his horse there listening to the Rangar's whisperings and trying to see through shadows would have been to invite fear, of the sort that grows into panic.\n\nThe Rangar followed him, close up, and both horse and mare sensed excitement. The mare's steel shoes sent up a shower of sparks, and King turned to rebuke the Rangar. Yet he did not speak. Never, in all the years he had known India and the borderland beyond, had he seen eyes so suggestive of a tiger's in the dark! Yet they were not the same color as a tiger's, nor the same size, nor the same shape!\n\n\u201cLook, sahib!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at what?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d\n\nAfter a second or two he caught a glimpse of bluish flame that flashed suddenly and died again, somewhere below to the right. Then all at once the flame burned brighter and steadier and began to move and to grow.\n\n\u201cHalt!\u201d King thundered; and his voice was as sharp and unexpected as a pistol-crack. This was something tangible, that a man could tackle--a perfect antidote for nerves.\n\nThe blue light continued on a zigzag course, as if a man were running among boulders with an unusual sort of torch; and as there was no answer King drew his pistol, took about thirty seconds' aim and fired. He fired straight at the blue light.\n\nIt vanished instantly, into measureless black silence.\n\n\u201cNow you've jolly well done it, haven't you!\u201d' the Rangar laughed in his ear. \u201cThat was her blue light--Yasmini's!\u201d",
    "Even with the man with the stomach ache mounted on the spare horse for the sake of extra speed (and he was not suffering one-fifth so much as he pretended); with Ismail to urge, and King to coax, and the fear of mountain death on every side of them, they were the part of a night and a day and a night and a part of another day in reaching Khinjan.\n\nDarya Khan, with the rifle held in both hands, led the way swiftly, but warily; and the last man's eyes looked ever backward, for many a sneaking enemy might have seen them and have judged a stern chase worth while.\n\nIn the \u201cHills\u201d the hunter has all the best of it, and the hunted needs must run. The accepted rule is to stalk one's enemy relentlessly and get him first. King happened to be hunting, although not for human life, and he felt bold, but the men with him dreaded each upstanding crag, that might conceal a rifleman. Armed men behind corners mean only one thing in the \u201cHills.\u201d\n\nThe animals grew weary to the verge of dropping, for the \u201croad\u201d had been made for the most part by mountain freshets, and where that was not the case it was imaginary altogether. They traveled upward, along ledges that were age-worn in the limestone--downward where the \u201chell-stones\u201d slid from under them to almost bottomless ravines, and a false step would have been instant death--up again between big edged boulders, that nipped the mule's pack and let the mule between--past many and many a lonely cairn that hid the bones of a murdered man (buried to keep his ghost from making trouble)--ever with a tortured ridge of rock for sky-line and generally leaning against a wind, that chilled them to the bone, while the fierce sun burned them.\n\nAt night and at noon they slept fitfully at the chance-met shrine of some holy man. The \u201cHills\u201d are full of them, marked by fluttering rags that can be seen for miles away; and though the Quran's meaning must be stretched to find excuse, the Hillmen are adept at stretching things and hold those shrines as sacred as the Book itself. Men who would almost rather cut throats than gamble regard them as sanctuaries.\n\nWhen a man says he is holy he can find few in the \u201cHills\u201d to believe him; but when he dies or is tortured to death or shot, even the men who murdered him will come and revere his grave.\n\nWhole villages leave their preciousest possessions at a shrine before wandering in search of summer pasture. They find them safe on their return, although the \u201cHills\u201d are the home of the lightest-fingered thieves on earth, who are prouder of villainy than of virtue. A man with a blood-feud, and his foe hard after him, may sleep in safety at a faquir's grave. His foe will wait within range, but he will not draw trigger until the grave is left behind.\n\nSo a man may rest in temporary peace even on the road to Khinjan, although Khinjan and peace have nothing whatever in common.\n\nIt was at such a shrine, surrounded by tattered rags tied to sticks, that fluttered in the wind three or four thousand feet above Khyber level, that King drew Ismail into conversation, and deftly forced on him the role of questioner.\n\n\n\u201cHow can'st thou see the Caves!\u201d he asked, for King had hinted at his intention; and for answer King gave him a glimpse of the gold bracelet.\n\n\u201cAye! Well and good! But even she dare not disobey the rule. Khinjan was there before she came, and the rule was there from the beginning, when the first men found the Caves! Some--hundreds--have gained admission, lacking the right. But who ever saw them again? Allah! I, for one, would not chance it!\u201d\n\n\u201cThou and I are two men!\u201d answered King. \u201cAllah gave thee qualities I lack. He gave thee the strength of a bull and a mountain goat in one, and her for a mistress. To me he gave other qualities. I shall see the Caves. I am not afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye! He gave thee other gifts indeed! But listen! How many Indian servants of the British Raj have set out to see the Caves? Many, many--aye, very many! Again and again the sirkar sent its loyal ones. Did any return? Not one! Some were crucified before they reached the place. One died slowly on the very rock whereon we sit, with his eyelids missing and his eyes turned to the sun! Some entered Khinjan, and the women of the place made sport with them. Those would rather have been crucified outside had they but known. Some, having got by Khinjan, entered the Caves. None ever came out again!\u201d",
    "Another ruffian fired at the roof, and while the crack of the shot yet echoed seven other of the arena guards stepped forward with long horns and blew a blast. That was greeted by a yell that made the cavern tremble.\n\nInstantly a hundred men rose from different directions and raced for the arena, each with a curved sword in either hand. The yelling changed back into the chant, only louder than before, and by that much more terrible. Cymbals crashed. The music-box resumed its measured grinding of The Marseillaise. And the hundred began an Afridi sword dance, than which there is nothing wilder in all the world. Its like can only be seen under the shadow of the \u201cHills.\u201d\n\nIsmail put his hands together and howled through them like a wolf on the war-path, nudging King with an elbow. So King imitated him, although one extra shout in all that din seemed thrown away.\n\nThe dancers pranced in a circle, each man whirling both swords around his head and the head of the man in front of him at a speed that passed belief. Their long black hair shook and swayed. The sweat began to pour from them until their arms and shoulders glistened. The speed increased. Another hundred men leaped in, forming a new ring outside the first, only facing the other way. Another hundred and fifty formed a ring outside them again, with the direction again reversed; and two hundred and fifty more formed an outer circle--all careering at the limit of their power, gasping as the beasts do in the fury of fighting to the death, slitting the air until it whistled, with swords that missed human heads by immeasurable fractions of an inch.\n\nIsmail seemed obsessed by the spirit of hell let loose--drawn by it, as by a magnet, although subsequent events proved him not to have been altogether without a plan. He got up, with his eyes fixed on the dance, and dragged King with him to a place ten rows nearer the arena, that had been vacated by a dancer. There--two, where there was only rightly room for one--he thrust himself and King next to some Orakzai Pathans, elbowing savagely to right and left to make room. And patience proved scarce. The instant oaths of anything but greeting were like overture to a dog fight.\n\n\u201cBismillah!\u201d swore the nearest man, deigning to use intelligible sentences at last. \u201cShall a dog of an Afridi bustle me?\u201d\n\nHe reached for the ever-ready Pathan knife, and Ismail, with both eyes on the dancing, neither heard nor saw. The Pathan leaned past King to stab, but paused in the instant that his knife licked clear. From a swift side-glance at King's face he changed to full stare, his scowl slowly giving place to a grin as he recognized him.\n\n\u201cAllah!\u201d\n\nHe drove the long blade back again, fidgeting about to make more room and kicking out at his next neighbor to the same end, so that presently King sat on the rock floor instead of on other men's hip-bones.\n\n\u201cWell met, hakim! See--the wound heals finely!\u201d\n\nBaring his shoulder under the smelly sheepskin coat, he lifted a bandage gingerly to show the clean opening out of which King had coaxed a bullet the day before. It looked wholesome and ready to heal.\n\n\u201cName thy reward, hakim! We Orakzai Pathans forget no favors!\u201d (Now that boast was a true one.)\n\nKing glanced to his left and saw that there was no risk of being overheard or interrupted by Ismail; the Afridi was beating his fists together, rocking from side to side in frenzy, and letting out about one yell a minute that would have curdled a wolf's heart.\n\n\u201cNay, I have all I need!\u201d he answered, and the Pathan laughed.\n\n\u201cIn thine own time, hakim! Need forgets none of us!\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue!\u201d said King.\n\nHe nodded more to himself than to the other man. He needed, for instance, very much to know who was planning a jihad, and who \u201cBull-with-a-beard\u201d might be; but it was not safe to confide just yet in a chance-made acquaintance. A very fair acquaintance with some phases of the East had taught him that names such as Bull-with-a-beard are often almost photographically descriptive. He rose to his feet to look. A blind man can talk, but it takes trained eyes to gather information.",
    "The dance went on for fifteen minutes yet, but then--quite unexpectedly--all the arena guards together fired a volley at the roof, and the dance stopped as if every dancer had been hit. The spectators were set surging by the showers of stone splinters, that hurt whom they struck, and their snarl was like a wolf-pack's when a tiger interferes. But the guards thought it all a prodigious joke and the more the crowd swore the more they laughed.\n\nPanting--foaming at the mouth, some of them--the dancers ran to their seats and set the crowd surging again, leaving the arena empty of all but the guards. The man whose seat Ismail had taken came staggering, slippery with sweat, and squeezed himself where he belonged, forcing King into the Pathan's empty place. Ismail threw his arms round the man and patted him, calling him \u201cmighty dancer,\u201d \u201cson of the wind,\u201d \u201cprince of prancers,\u201d \u201cprince of swordsmen,\u201d \u201cwar-horse,\u201d and a dozen more endearing epithets. The fellow lay back across Ismail's knees, breathless but well enough contented.\n\nAnd after a few more minutes the Orakzai Pathan came back, and King tried to make room for him to sit.\n\n\u201cI bade thee keep my place!\u201d he growled, towering over King and plucking at his knife-belt irresolutely. He made it clear without troubling to use words that any other man would have had to fight, and the hakim might think himself lucky.\n\n\u201cTake my seat,\u201d said King, struggling to get up.\n\n\u201cNay, nay--sit still, thou. I can kick room for myself. So! So! So!\u201d\n\nThere was an answering snarl of hate that seemed like a song to him, amid which he sat down.\n\n\u201cThe mullah Muhammad Anim answered he knows nothing of thee and cares less! He said--and he said it with vehemence--it is no more to him where a hakim sits than where the rats hide!\u201d\n\nHe watched King's face and seeing that, King allowed his facial muscles to express chagrin.\n\n\u201cBetween us, it is a poor time for messages to him. He is too full of pride that his lashkar should have beaten the British.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid they beat the British greatly?\u201d King asked him, with only vague interest on his face and a prayer inside him that his heart might flutter less violently against his ribs. His voice was as non-committal as the mullah's message.\n\n\u201cWho knows, when so many men would rather lie than kill? Each one who returned swears he slew a hundred. But some did not return. Wait and watch, say I!\u201d\n\nNow a man stood up near the edge of the crowd whom King recognized; and recognition brought no joy with it. The mullah without hair or eyelashes, who had admitted him and his party through the mosque into the Caves, strode out to the middle of the arena all alone, strutting and swaggering. He recalled the man's last words and drew no consolation from them, either.\n\n\u201cMany have entered! Some went out by a different road!\u201d\n\nCold chills went down his back. All at once Ismail's manner became unencouraging. He ceased to make a fuss over the dancer and began to eye King sidewise, until at last he seemed unable to contain the malice that would well forth.\n\n\u201cAt the gate there were only words!\u201d he whispered. \u201cHere in this cavern men wait for proof!\u201d\n\nHe licked his teeth suggestively, as a wolf does when he contemplates a meal. Then, as an afterthought, as though ashamed, \u201cI love thee! Thou art a man after my own heart! But I am her man! Wait and see!\u201d\n\nThe mullah in the arena, blinking with his lashless eyes, held both arms up for silence in the attitude of a Christian priest blessing a congregation. The guards backed his silent demand with threatening rifles. The din died to a hiss of a thousand whispers, and then the great cavern grew still, and only the river could be heard sucking hungrily between the smooth stone banks.\n\n\u201cGod is great!\u201d the mullah howled.\n\n\u201cGod is great!\u201d the crowd thundered in echo to him; and then the vault took up the echoes. \u201cGod is great--is great--is great--ea--ea--eat!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Muhammad is His prophet!\u201d howled the mullah. Instantly they answered him again.\n\n\u201cAnd Muhammad is His prophet!\u201d\n\n\u201cHis prophet--is His prophet--is His prophet!\u201d said the stalactites, in loud barks--then in murmurs--then in awe-struck whispers.\n\nThat seemed to be all the religious ritual Khinjan remembered or could tolerate. Considering that the mullah, too, must have killed his man in cold blood before earning the right to be there, perhaps it was enough--too much. There were men not far from King who shuddered.\n\n\u201cThere are strangers!\u201d announced the mullah, as a man might say, \u201cI smell a rat!\u201d But he did not look at anybody in particular; he blinked at the crowd.\n\n\u201cStrangers!\u201d said the stalactites, in an awe-struck whisper.\n\n\u201cShow them! Show them! Let them stand forth!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh-h-h-h-h! Let them stand forth!\u201d said the roof.\n\nThe mullah bowed as if that idea were a new one and he thought it better than his own; for all crowds love flattery.\n\n\u201cBring them!\u201d he shouted, and King suppressed a shudder--for what proof had he of right to be there beyond Ismail's verbal corroboration of a lie? Would Ismail lie for him again? he wondered. And if so, would the lie be any use?\n\nNot far from where King sat there was an immediate disturbance in the crowd, and a wretched-looking Baluchi was thrust forward at a run, with arms lashed to his sides and a pitiful look of terror on his face. Two more Baluchis were hustled along after him, protesting a little, but looking almost as hopeless.\n\nOnce in the arena, the guards took charge of all three of them and lined them up facing the mullah, clubbing them with their rifle-butts to get quick obedience. The crowd began to be noisy again, but the mullah signed for silence.\n\n\u201cThese are traitors!\u201d he howled, with a gesture such as Ajax might have used when he defied the lightning.\n\nThe roof said \u201cTraitors!\u201d\n\n\u201cSlay them, then!\u201d howled the crowd, delighted. And blinking behind the horn-rimmed spectacles, King began to look about busily for hope, where there did not seem to be any.\n\n\u201cNay, hear me first!\u201d the mullah howled, and his voice was like a wolf's at hunting time. \u201cHear, and be warned!\u201d\n\nThe crowd grew very still, but King saw that some men licked their lips, as if they well knew what was coming.\n\n\u201cThese three men came, and one was a new man!\u201d the mullah howled. \u201cThe other two were his witnesses! All three swore that the first man came from slaying an unbeliever in the teeth of written law. They said he ran from the law. So, as the custom is, I let all three enter!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d said the crowd. \u201cGood!\u201d They might have been five thousand judges, judging in equity, so grave they were. Yet they licked their lips.\n\n\u201cBut later, word came to me saying they are liars. So--again as the custom is--I ordered them bound and held!\u201d\n\n\u201cSlay them! Slay them!\u201d the crowd yelped, gleeful as a wolf-pack on a scent and abandoning solemnity as suddenly as it had been assumed. \u201cSlay them!\u201d\n\nThey were like the wind, whipping in and out among Khinjan's rocks, savage and then still for a minute, savage and then still.\n\n\u201cNay, there is a custom yet!\u201d the mullah howled, holding up both arms. And there was silence again like the lull before a hurricane, with only the great black river talking to itself.\n\n\u201cWho speaks for them? Does any speak for them?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak for them?\u201d said the roof.\n\n\nThere was silence. Then there was a murmur of astonishment. Over opposite to where King sat the mullah stood up, who the Pathan had said was \u201cBull-with-a-beard\u201d--Muhammad Anim.\n\n\u201cThe men are mine!\u201d he growled. His voice was like a bear's at bay; it was low, but it carried strangely. And as he spoke he swung his great head between his shoulders, like a bear that means to charge. \u201cThe proof they brought has been stolen! They had good proof! I speak for them! The men are mine!\u201d\n\nThe Pathan nudged King in the ribs with an elbow like a club and tickled his ear with hot breath.\n\n\u201cBull-with-a-beard speaks truth!\u201d he grinned. \u201c'Truth and a lie together! Good may it do him and them! They die, they three Baluchis!\u201d\n\n\u201cProof!\u201d howled the mullah who had no hair eyelashes.\n\n\u201cProof--oof--oof!\u201d said the stalactites.\n\n\u201cProof! Show us proof!\u201d yelled the crowd.\n\n\u201cWords at the gate--proof in the cavern!\u201d howled the lashless one.\n\nThe Pathan next King leaned over to whisper to him again, but stiffened in the act. There was a great gasp the same instant, as the whole crowd caught its breath all together. The mullah in the middle froze into immobility. Bull-with-a-beard stood mumbling, swaying his great head from side to side, no longer suggestive of a bear about to charge, but of one who hesitates.\n\nThe crowd was staring at the end of the bridge. King stared, too, and caught his own breath. For Yasmini stood there, smiling on them all as the new moon smiles down on the Khyber! She had come among them like a spirit, all unheralded.\n\nSo much more beautiful than the one likeness King had seen of her that for a second he doubted who she was--more lovely than he had imagined her even in his dreams--she stood there, human and warm and real, who had begun to seem a myth, clad in gauzy transparent stuff that made no secret of sylph-like shapeliness and looking nearly light enough to blow away. Her feet--and they were the most marvelously molded things he had ever seen--were naked and played restlessly on the naked stone. Not one part of her was still for a fraction of a second; yet the whole effect was of insolently lazy ease.\n\nHer eyes blazed brighter than the little jewels stitched to her gossamer dress, and when a man once looked at them he did not find it easy to look away again. Even mullah Muhammad Anim seemed transfixed, like a great foolish animal.\n\nBut King was staring very hard indeed at something else--mentally cursing the plain glass spectacles he wore, that had begun to film over and dim his vision. There were two bracelets on her arm, both barbaric things of solid gold. The smaller of the two was on her wrist and the larger on her upper arm, but they were so alike, except for size, and so exactly like the one Rewa Gunga had given him in her name and that had been stolen from him in the night, that he ran the risk of removing the glasses a moment to stare with unimpeded eyes. Even then the distance was too great. He could not quite see.\n\nBut her eyes began to search the crowd in his direction, and then he knew two things absolutely. He was sitting where she had ordered Ismail to place him; for she picked him out almost instantly, and laughed as if somebody had struck a silver bell. And one of those bracelets was the one that he had worn; for she flaunted it at him, moving her arm so that the light should make the gold glitter.",
    "\u201cKurram Khan!\u201d the lashless mullah howled, like a lone wolf in the moonlight, and King stood up.\n\nIt is one of the laws of Cocker, who wrote the S. S. Code, that a man is alive until he is proved dead, and where there is life there is opportunity. In that grim minute King felt heretical; but a man's feelings are his own affair provided he can prove it, and he managed to seem about as much at ease as a native hakim ought to feel at such an initiation.\n\n\u201cCome forward!\u201d the mullah howled, and he obeyed, treading gingerly between men who were at no pains to let him by, and silently blessing them, because he was not really in any hurry at all. Yasmini looked lovely from a distance, and life was sweet.\n\n\u201cWho are his witnesses?\u201d\n\n\u201cWitnesses?\u201d the roof hissed.\n\n\u201cI!\u201d shouted Ismail, jumping up.\n\n\u201cI!\u201d cracked the roof. \u201cI! I!\u201d So that for a second King almost believed he had a crowd of men to swear for him and did not hear Darya Khan at all, who rose from a place not very far behind where had sat.\n\nIsmail followed him in a hurry, like a man wading a river with loose clothes gathered in one arm and the other arm ready in case of falling. He took much less trouble than King not to tread on people, and oaths' marked his wake.\n\nDarya Khan did not go so fast. As he forced his way forward a man passed him up the wooden box that King had used to stand on; he seized it in both hands with a grin and a jest and went to stand behind King and Ismail, in line with the lashless mullah, facing Yasmini. Yasmini smiled at them all as if they were actors in her comedy, and she well pleased with them.\n\n\u201cLook ye!\u201d howled the mullah. \u201cLook ye and look well, for this is to be one of us!\u201d\n\nKing felt ten thousand eyes burn holes in his back, but the one pair of eyes that mocked him from the bridge was more disconcerting.\n\n\u201cTurn, Kurram Khan! Turn that all may see!\u201d\n\nFeeling like a man on a spit, he revolved slowly. By the time he had turned once completely around, besides knowing positively that one of the two bracelets on her right arm was the one he had worn, or else its exact copy, he knew that he was not meant to die yet; for his eyes could work much more swiftly than the horn-rimmed spectacles made believe. He decided that Yasmini meant he should be frightened, but not much hurt just yet.\n\nSo he ceased altogether to feel frightened and took care to look more scared than ever.\n\n\u201cWho paid the price of thy admission?\u201d the mullah howled, and King cleared his throat, for he was not quite sure yet what that might mean.\n\n\u201cSpeak, Kurram Khan!\u201d Yasmini purred, smiling her loveliest. \u201cTell them whom you slew.\u201d\n\nKing turned and faced the crowd, raising himself on the balls of his feet to shout, like a man facing thousands of troops on parade. He nearly gave himself away, for habit had him unawares. A native hakim, given the stoutest lungs in all India, would not have shouted in that way.\n\n\u201cCappitin Attleystan King!\u201d he roared. And he nearly jumped out of his skin when his own voice came rattling back at him from the roof overhead.\n\n\u201cCappitin Attleystan King!\u201d it answered.\n\nYasmini chuckled as a little rill will sometimes chuckle among ferns. It was devilish. It seemed to say there were traps not far ahead.\n\n\u201cWhere was he slain?\u201d asked the mullah.\n\n\u201cIn the Khyber Pass,\u201d said King.\n\n\u201cIn the Khyber Pass!\u201d the roof whispered hoarsely, as if aghast at such cold-bloodedness.\n\n\u201cNow give proof!\u201d said the mullah. \u201cWords at the gate--proof in the cavern! Without good proof, there is only one way out of here!\u201d\n\n\u201cProof!\u201d the crowd thundered. \u201cProof!\u201d\n\n\u201cProof! Proof! Proof!\u201d the roof echoed.\n\nThere was no need for Darya Khan to whisper. King's hands were behind him, and he had seen what he had seen and guessed what he had guessed while he was turning to let the crowd look at him. His fingers closed on human hair.\n\n\u201cNay, it is short!\u201d hissed Darya Khan. \u201cTake the two ears, or hold it by the jawbone! Hold it high in both hands!\u201d\n\nKing obeyed, without looking at the thing, and Ismail, turning to face the crowd, rose on tiptoe and filled his lungs for the effort of his life.\n\n\u201cThe head of Cappitin Attleystan King--infidel kaffir--British arrficer!\u201d he howled.\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d the crowd bellowed. \u201cGood! Throw it!\u201d\n\nThe crowd's roar and the roof's echoes combined until pandemonium.\n\n\u201cThrow it to them, Kurram Khan!\u201d Yasmini purred from the bridge end, speaking as softly and as sweetly, as if she coaxed a child. Yet her voice carried.\n\nHe lowered the head, but instead of looking at it he looked up at her. He thought she was enjoying herself and his predicament as he had never seen any one enjoy anything.\n\n\u201cThrow it to them, Kurram Khan!\u201d she purred. \u201cIt is the custom!\u201d\n\n\u201cThrow it! Throw it!\u201d the crowd thundered.\n\nHe turned the ghastly thing until it lay face-upward in his hands, and so at last he saw it. He caught his breath, and only the horn-rimmed spectacles, that he had cursed twice that night, saved him from self-betrayal. The cavern seemed to sway, but he recovered and his wits worked swiftly. If Yasmini detected his nervousness she gave no sign.\n\n\u201cThrow it! Throw it! Throw it!\u201d\n\nThe crowd was growing impatient. Many men were standing, waving their arms to draw attention to themselves, and he wondered what the ultimate end of the head would be, if he obeyed and threw it to them. Watching Yasmini's eyes, he knew it had not entered her head that he might disobey.\n\nHe looked past her toward the river. There were no guards near enough to prevent what he intended; but he had to bear in mind that the guards had rifles, and if he acted too suddenly one of them might shoot at him unbidden. They were wondrous free with their cartridges, those guards, in a land where ammunition is worth its weight in silver coin.\n\nHolding the head before him with both hands, he began to walk toward the river, edging all the while a little toward the crowd as if meaning to get nearer before he threw.\n\nHe was much more than half-way to the river's edge before Yasmini or anybody else divined his true intention. The mullah grew suspicions first and yelled. Then King hurried, for he did not believe Yasmini would need many seconds in which to regain command of any situation. But she saw fit to stand still and watch.\n\nHe reached the river and stood there. Now he was in no hurry at all, for it stood to reason that unless Yasmini very much desired him to be kept alive he would have been shot dead already. For a moment the crowd was so interested that it forgot to bark and snarl.\n\nHis next move was as deliberate as he could make it, although he was careful to avoid the least suggestion of mummery (for then the crowd would have suspected disloyalty to Islam, and the \u201cHills\u201d are very, very pious, and very suspicious of all foreign ritual).\n\nHe did a thoughtful simple thing that made every savage who watched him gasp because of its very unexpectedness. He held the head in both hands, threw it far out into the river and stood to watch it sink. Then, without visible emotion of any kind, he walked back stolidly to face Yasmini at the bridge end, with shoulders a little more stubborn now than they ought to be, and chin a shade too high, for there never was a man who could act quite perfectly.",
    "Telling the story afterward King never made any effort to describe his own sensations. It was surely enough to state what he saw, after a breathless climb among the rat-runs of a mountain with his imagination fired already by what had happened in the Cavern of Earth's Drink.\n\nThe leather curtains slipped through his fingers and closed behind him with the clash of rings on a rod. But he was beyond being startled. He was not really sure he was in the world. He knew he was awake, and he knew he was glad he had left his shoes outside. But he was not certain whether it was the twentieth century, or fifty-five B. C., or earlier yet; or whether time had ceased. Very vividly in that minute there flashed before his mind Mark Twain's suggestion of the Transposition of Epochs.\n\nThe place where he was did not look like a cave, but a palace chamber, for the rock walls had been trimmed square and polished smooth; then they had been painted pure white, except for a wide blue frieze, with a line of gold-leaf drawn underneath it. And on the frieze, done in gold-leaf too, was the Grecian lady of the lamps, always dancing. There were fifty or sixty figures of her, no two the same.\n\nA dozen lamps were burning, set in niches cut in the walls at measured intervals. They were exactly like the two outside, except that their horn chimneys were stained yellow instead of red, suffusing everything in a golden glow.\n\nOpposite him was a curtain, rather like that through which he had entered. Near to the curtain was a bed, whose great wooden posts were cracked with age. And it was at the bed he stared, with eyes that took in every detail but refused to believe.\n\nIn spite of its age it was spread with fine new linen. Richly embroidered, not very ancient Indian draperies hung down from it to the floor on either side. On it, above the linen, a man and a woman lay hand-in-hand; and the woman was so exactly like Yasmini, even to her clothing, and her naked feet, that it was not possible for a man to be self-possessed.\n\nThey both seemed asleep. It was as if Yasmini, weary from the dancing, had laid herself to sleep beside her lord. But who was he? And why did he wear Roman armor? And why was there no guard to keep intruders out?\n\nIt was minutes before he satisfied himself that the man's breast did not rise and fall under the bronze armor and that the woman's jeweled gauzy stuff was still. Imagination played such tricks with him that in the stillness he imagined he heard breathing.\n\nAfter he was sure they were both dead, he went nearer, but it was a minute yet before he knew the woman was not she. At first a wild thought possessed him that she had killed herself.\n\nThe only thing to show who he had been were the letters S. P. Q. R. on a great plumed helmet, on a little table by the bed. But she was the woman of the lamp-bowls and the frieze. A life-size stone statue in a corner was so like her, and like Yasmini too, that it was difficult to decide which of the two it represented.\n\nShe had lived when he did, for her fingers were locked in his. And he had lived two thousand years ago, because his armor was about as old as that, and for proof that he had died in it part of his breast had turned to powder inside the breastplate. The rest of his body was whole and perfectly preserved.\n\nStern, handsome in a high-beaked Roman way, gray on the temples, firm-lipped, he lay like an emperor in harness. But the pride and resolution on his face were outdone by the serenity of hers. Very surely those two had been lovers.\n\nSomething--he could not decide what--about the man's appearance kept him staring for ten minutes, holding his breath unconsciously and letting it out in little silent gasps. It annoyed him that he could not pin down the elusive thing; and when he went on presently to be curious about more tangible things, it was only to be faced with the unexplainable at every turn.\n\nHow had the bodies been preserved, for instance? They were perfect, except for that one detail of the man's breast. The air was full of the perfume he had learned to recognize as Yasmini's, but there was no sniff about the bodies of pitch or bitumen, or of any other chemical. Nor was there any sign of violence about them, or means of telling how they died, or when, except for the probable date of the man's armor.\n\nBoth of them looked young and healthy--the woman younger than thirty--twenty-five at a guess--and the man perhaps forty, perhaps forty-five.\n\nHe bent over them. Every stitch of the man's clothing had decayed in the course of centuries, so that his armor rested on the naked skin, except for a dressed leather kilt about his middle. The leather was as old as the curtains at the entrance, and as well preserved.\n\nBut the woman's silken clothing was as new as the bedding; and that was so new that it had been woven in Belfast, Ireland, by machinery and bore the mark of the firm that made it!\n\nYet, they both died at about the same time, or how could their fingers have been interlaced? And some of the jewelry on the woman's clothes was very ancient as well as priceless.\n\nHe looked closer at the fingers for signs of force and suddenly caught his breath. Under the woman's flimsy sleeve was a wrought gold bracelet, smaller than that one he himself had worn in Delhi and up the Khyber--exactly like the little one that Yasmini wore on her wrist in the Cavern of Earth's Drink! He raised the loose sleeve to look more closely at it.\n\nThe sleeve overlay the man's forearm, and the movement laid bare another bracelet, on the man's right wrist. Size for size, this was the same as the one that had been stolen from himself.\n\nMemory prompted him. He felt its outer edge with a finger-nail. There was the little nick that he had made in the soft gold when he struck it against the cell bars in the jail at the Mir Khan Palace!\n\nThat put another thought in his head. It was less than two hours since Yasmini danced in the arena. It might well be much less than that since she had taken off her bracelets. He laid a finger on the dead man's stone-cold hand and let it rest so for a minute. Then, running it slowly up the wrist, he touched the gold. It was warm. He repeated the test on the woman's wrist. Hers was warm, too. Both bracelets had been worn by a living being within an hour--\n\n\u201cProbably within minutes!\u201d\n\nHe muttered and frowned in thought, and then suddenly jumped backward. The leather curtain near the bed had moved on its bronze rod.\n\n\u201cAren't they dears?\u201d a voice said in English behind him. \u201cAren't they sweet?\u201d\n\nHe had jumped so as to face about, and somebody laughed at him. Yasmini stood not two arms' lengths away, lovelier than the dead woman because of the merry life in her, young and warm, aglow, but looking like the dead woman and the woman of the frieze--the woman of the lamp--bowls--the statue--come to life, speaking to him in English more sweetly than if it had been her mother tongue. The English abuse their language. Yasmini caressed it and made it do its work twice over.",
    "His eyes seemed unable to obey his own will any longer. They obeyed her voice. He gazed again into the crystal, and it clouded over. But although he obeyed her, the crystal obeyed him and answered at least in part the questions his imagination asked. He was not conscious of asking anything, but being a soldier his curiosity followed a more or less definite line.\n\nYasmini's breath began to come and go again with the little hissing sound. Her hot hands pressed his own. The mist suddenly dissolved. There was a road--a long white road, across a plain, and the men-at-arms fought their way along it. They were facing east.\n\nArchers opposed them--archers on foot, and cavalry--Parthians. The Parthians were wild, but the drill of the men-at-arms was a thing to marvel at. When the flights of arrows came they knelt behind their shields. When the horsemen charged they closed in solid phalanx, and the inner ranks hurled javelins at ten-yard range. When the fury of the onslaught died they formed in column and went forward, gaining furlongs at a time while their enemy watched them and wondered.\n\nIt was plain that the enemy expected them to retreat sooner or later, for the archers and cavalry were at great pains to get behind them, so that before long the road ahead was less well defended than that behind. It did not seem to occur to the enemy that they were pressing toward the distant line of hills and did not seek to return at all.\n\nThey had no baggage to impede them. It was absurd to suppose they would not try to fight a way back soon. They must be a Roman raiding party, out to teach Parthians a lesson. Yet they pressed ever forward, and the hills grew ever nearer; while he sat a great brown charger calmly in their midst and gave them not too many orders, but here and there a word of praise, and once or twice a trumpet shout of encouragement. He seemed to own the knack of being wherever the fight was fiercest. His mere presence seemed better than a hundred men when the phalanx bent before charging cavalry.\n\nShe rode a little white horse, beside him always and utterly scornful of the risk. She wore no armor--carried no shield. Her bare feet showed through the sandal straps, and the outlines of her lissom body were quite visible through the muslin stuff she wore. She might have just come from the dancing. She had a flower in her hand, and a wreath of flowers in her hair. She shouted more encouragement than he. She shouted too much. Once he laid a strong brown hand across her mouth, and she held it there and kissed it.\n\nThey lost men--five or six or ten or twenty at each onslaught. Perhaps they had been a thousand strong in the beginning. Their own men--the regimental surgeons probably--cut the throats of the badly wounded, to save them from the enemy's attentions; and by this time they were not more than seven or eight hundred strong.\n\nBut they went forward--ever forward--and the line of hills drew near. Then he began to stir himself, and she with him. He shouted to them to charge, and she echoed him, leaving his side at last to take command of a wing and sting the tired-out men-at-arms into new enthusiasm. In a minute they were a roaring tide that swept forward to the foot of the hills and surged upward without a check. In a little while they were hurling boulders down on an enemy that seemed inclined to parley.\n\nThen, like a shadow of the incense cloud above, the mist closed up in the crystal again, and in a moment more King and Yasmini were looking into each other's eyes again above it.\n\n\n\u201cI have seen that before,\u201d she said, shaking her, head. \u201cI am weary of their battles. They won; that is enough! I must know how they failed, so that we make no such mistakes!\u201d\n\nHer face was flushed, and her eyes glowed with the fire that is not lit by ordinary passion. She was being eaten by ambition--burned by her own fire--by ambition not totally selfish, for she yearned to shepherd King as she seemed to think this woman of the vision had not shepherded the man in armor.\n\n\n\u201cLook again!\u201d she said. \u201cLook again! And oh, ye old gods, show--show me wherein she failed!\u201d\n\nThey stared again, and once more the crystal clouded. Out of the cloud came a city in the middle of a plain, and the city was besieged. It was not a very great city, but from the outside it looked rich, for domes and roofs and towers showed above the wall, all well built and well preserved. He and she, sitting their horses out of arrow range from the main gate seemed confident of taking it and eager to get it over with.\n\nThey no longer had only six or seven hundred men, but men by the thousand. Their veterans in Roman armor were in command of others now, and they had a human pack-train with them, heavily burdened captives who sulked in chains under a guard.\n\nThe mist cleared further, and the gate gave in under the blows of an improvised battering-ram, covered by showers of arrows from short range. Then, like a river breaking down a dam, the thousands stormed in, howling. Smoke rose. There were screams of women. A great tower near the gate, that was half wood, half stone, crackled and curled up in yellow and crimson flame. He and she rode in together as modern men and women ride through a gate to the covert side at a fox-hunt. They chatted and laughed together, and their horses pranced, responding to the humor of their riders.\n\nKing would have liked to tear his eyes away from the scenes that followed in the tree-lined streets, but the crystal ball held him as if in a trance--that and Yasmini's hands that clasped his own like hot torture chamber clamps. Animals fighting to the death are not so vile, nor so inhuman as men can be in the hour of what they call victory. Even the little children of that city paid the penalty for having closed the gate.\n\nTime was no measure to the crystal ball. In minutes it showed the devil's work of hours. The city went up in smoke and flame, and from the far side through a great breach in the wall the conquerors went out, with their plunder and such prisoners as had been saved to drag and carry it.",
    "The temptation was to fling the brute after his victim. The temptation always is to do the wrong thing--to cap wrath with wrath, injustice with vengeance. That way wars begin and are never ended. King beckoned him into the cave, and bent over the chest of medical supplies. Then, finding the light better for his purpose at the entrance, he called the man back and made him sit down on the box.\n\nThe business of lancing boils is not especially edifying in itself; but that particular minor operation probably saved India. But for hope of it the man with boils would never have stood two turns on guard hand running and let the relief sleep on; so he would not have been on duty when the message came to carry King's belongings to his new cave of residence. There would have been no object in killing the dumb man and so there would have been an expert with a loaded rifle to keep Muhammad Anim lurking down the trail.\n\nMuhammad Anim came--like the devil to scotch King's faith. He had followed the women with the loads. He stood now, like a big bear on a mountain track, swaying his head from side to side six feet away from King, watching the boils succumb to treatment. He grunted when the job was finished, and King jumped, nearly driving the lance into a new place in his patient's neck.\n\n\n\u201cLet him go!\u201d growled Muhammad Anim. \u201cGo thou! Stand guard over the women until I come!\u201d\n\nThe mullah turned a rifle this way and that in his paws, like a great bear dancing. The Mahsudi with a sore neck could have shot him perhaps, but there are men with whom only the bravest dare try conclusions. In cold gray dawn it would have needed a martinet to make a firing squad do execution on Muhammad Anim, even with his hands tied and his back against a wall. A man whose boils had just been lanced was no match for him at all, even in broad daylight. The Hillman slunk away and did as he was told.\n\n\n\u201cWhat meant thy message?\u201d growled the mullah. \u201cThere came a Pathan to me in the Cavern of Earth's Drink with word that yonder sits a hakim. What of it?\u201d\n\nKing had almost forgotten the message he had sent to Muhammad Anim in the Cavern of Earth's Drink. But that was not why his eyes looked past the mullah's now, nor why he did not answer. The mullah did not look round, for he knew what was happening.\n\nThe very Orakzai Pathan who had sat next King in the Cavern of Earth's Drink, and who had carried the message for him, was creeping up behind the women and already had his rifle leveled at the man with boils.\n\n\n\u201cAye!\u201d said the mullah, watching King's eyes. \u201cHe has done well, and the road is clear!\u201d\n\nThe man with boils offered no fight. He dropped his rifle and threw his hands up. In a moment the Orakzai Pathan was in command of two rifles, holding them in one hand and nodding and making signs to King from among the women, whom he seemed to regard as his plunder too. The women appeared supremely indifferent in any event. King nodded back to him. A friend is a friend in the \u201cHills,\u201d and rare is the man who spares his enemy.\n\n\n\u201cWhy send that message to me?\u201d asked Muhammad Anim.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked King. \u201cIf none know where the hakim is, how shall the hakim earn a living?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone comes to earn a living in the Hills,\u201d growled the mullah, swaying his head slowly and devouring King with cruel calculating eyes. \u201cWhy art thou here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI slew a man,\u201d said King.\n\n\u201cThou liest! It was my men who got the head that let thee in! Speak! Why art thou here?\u201d\n\nBut King did not answer. The mullah resumed.\n\n\n\u201cHe who brought me the message yesterday says he has it from another, who had it from a third, that thou art here because she plans a simultaneous rising in India, and thou art from the Punjab where the Sikhs all wait to rise. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cThy man said it,\u201d answered King.\n\n\u201cWhat sayest thou?\u201d the mullah asked.\n\n\u201cI say nothing,\u201d said King.\n\n\u201cThen hear me!\u201d said the mullah. \u201cListen, thou.\u201d But he did not begin to speak yet. He tried to see past King into the cave and to peer about into the shadows.\n\n\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asked. \u201cHer man Rewa Gunga went yesterday, with three men and a letter to carry, down the Khyber. But where is she?\u201d\n\nSo he had slept the clock round! King did not answer. He blocked the way into the cave and looked past the mullah at a sight that fascinated, as a serpent's eyes are said to fascinate a bird. But the mullah, who knew perfectly well what must be happening, did not trouble to turn his head.\n\nThe Orakzai Pathan crouched among the women, and the women grinned. The Mahsudi, having surrendered and considering himself therefore absolved from further responsibility at least for the present, spat over the precipice and fingered gingerly the sore place where his boils had been. He yawned and dropped both hands to his side; and it was at that instant that the Pathan sprang at him.\n\nWith arms like the jaws of a vise he pinned the Mahsudi's to his side, and lifted him from off his feet. The fellow screamed, and the Pathan shouted \u201cHo!\u201d But he did no murder yet. He let his victim grow fully conscious of the fate in store for him, holding him so that his frantic kicks were squandered on thin air. He turned him slowly, until he was upside-down; and so, perpendicular, face-outward, he hove him forward like a dead log. He stood and watched his victim fall two or three thousand feet before troubling to turn and resume both rifles; and it was not until then, as if he had been mentally conscious of each move, that the mullah turned to look, and seeing only one man nodded.\n\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d he grunted. \u201c'Shabash!\u201d' (Well done!)\n\nThen he turned his head to stare into King's face, with the scrutiny of a trader appraising loot. Fire leaped up behind his calculating eyes. And without a word passing between them, King knew that this man as well as Yasmini was in possession of the secret of the Sleeper. Perhaps he knew it first; perhaps she snatched the keeping of the secret from him. At all events he knew it and recognized King's likeness to the Sleeper, for his eyes betrayed him. He began to stroke his beard monotonously with one hand. The rifle, that he pretended to be holding, really leaned against his back and with the free hand he was making signals.",
    "Four thousand men with women and children and baggage do not move so swiftly as one man or a dozen, especially in the \u201cHills,\u201d where discipline is reckoned beneath a proud man's honor. There were many miles to go before Khinjan when night fell and the mullah bade them camp. He bade them camp because they would have done it otherwise in any case.\n\n\n\u201cAnd we,\u201d said King to his all but eighty who crowded around him, \u201cbeing men with new eyes and with a great new hope in us, will halt here and eat the evening meal and watch for an opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpportunity for what?\u201d they asked him.\n\n\u201cAn opportunity to show how Allah loves the brave!\u201d said King, and they had to be content with that, for he would say no more to them. Seeing he would not talk, they made their little fires all around him and watched while their women cooked the food. The mullah would not let them eat until he and the whole camp had prayed like the only righteous.\n\nWhen the evening meal was eaten, and sentries had been set at every vantage point, and the men all sat about cleansing their beards and fingers the mullah sent for the hakim again. Only this time he sent twenty men to fetch him.\n\nThere was so nearly a fight that the skin all down King's back was gooseflesh, for a fight at that juncture would have ruined everything. At the least he would have been made a hopeless helpless prisoner. But in the end the mullah's men drew off snarling, and before they could have time to receive new orders or reinforcements, King's die was cast.\n\nThere came another order from the mullah. The women and children were to be left in camp next dawn, and to remain there until sent for. There was murmuring at that around the camp, and especially among King's contingent. But King laughed.\n\n\n\u201cIt is good!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhy? How so?\u201d they asked him.\n\n\u201cBid your women make for the Khyber soon after the mullah marches tomorrow. Bid them travel down the Khyber until we and they meet!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut--\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease yourselves, sahibs!\u201d The hakim's air was one of supremest indifference. \u201cAs for me, I leave no women behind me in the mountains. I am content.\u201d\n\nThey murmured a while, but they gave the orders to their women, and King watched the women nod. And all that while Ismail watched him with carefully disguised concern, but undisguised interest. And King understood. Enlightenment comes to a man swiftly, when it does come, as a rule.\n\nHe recalled that Yasmini had not done much to make his first entry into Khinjan easy. On the contrary, she had put him on his mettle and had set Rewa Gunga to the task of frightening him and had tested him and tried him before tempting him at last.\n\nShe must be watching him now, for even the East repeats itself. She had sent Ismail for that purpose. It might be Ismail's business to drive a knife in him at the first opportunity, but he doubted that. It was much more likely that, having failed in an attempt to have him murdered, she was superstitiously remorseful. Her course would depend on his. If he failed, she was done with him. If he succeeded in establishing a strong position of his own, she would yield.\n\nAll of which did not explain Ismail's whisperings and noddings and chin strokings with King's contingent. But it explained enough for King's present purpose, and he wasted no time on riders to the problem. With or without Ismail's aid, with or without his enmity, he must control his eighty men and give the slip to the mullah, and he went at once about the best way to do both.\n\n\n\u201cWe will go now,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThat sentry in yonder shadow has his back turned. He has over-eaten. We will rush him and put good running between us and the mullah.\u201d\n\nSurprised into obedience, and too delighted at the prospect of action to wonder why they should obey a hakim so, they slung on their bandoliers and made ready. Ismail brought up King's horse and he mounted. And then at King's word all eighty made a sudden swoop on the drowsy sentry and took him unawares. They tossed him over the cliff, too startled to scream an alarm; and though sentries on either hand heard them and shouted, they were gone into outer darkness like wind-blown ghosts of dead men before the mullah even knew what was happening.\n\nThey did not halt until not one of them could run another yard, King trusting to his horse to find a footing along the cliff-tops, and to the men to find the way.\n\n\n\u201cWhither?\u201d one whispered to him.\n\n\u201cTo Khinjan!\u201d he answered; and that was enough. Each whispered to the other, and they all became fired with curiosity more potent than money bribes.\n\nWhen he halted at last and dismounted and sat down and the stragglers caught up, panting, they held a council of war all together, with Ismail sitting at King's back and leaning a chin on his shoulder in order to hear better. Bone pressed on bone, and the place grew numb; King shook him off a dozen times; but each time Ismail set his chin back on the same spot, as a dog will that listens to his master. Yet he insisted he was her man, and not King's."

  "Robert Louis Stevenson -- Kidnapped": [
    "I will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in the month of June, the year of grace 1751, when I took the key for the last time out of the door of my father\u2019s house. The sun began to shine upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road; and by the time I had come as far as the manse, the blackbirds were whistling in the garden lilacs, and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of the dawn was beginning to arise and die away.\n\nMr. Campbell, the minister of Essendean, was waiting for me by the garden gate, good man! He asked me if I had breakfasted; and hearing that I lacked for nothing, he took my hand in both of his and clapped it kindly under his arm.\n\n\u201cWell, Davie, lad,\u201d said he, \u201cI will go with you as far as the ford, to set you on the way.\u201d And we began to walk forward in silence.\n\n\u201cAre ye sorry to leave Essendean?\u201d said he, after awhile.\n\n\u201cWhy, sir,\u201d said I, \u201cif I knew where I was going, or what was likely to become of me, I would tell you candidly. Essendean is a good place indeed, and I have been very happy there; but then I have never been anywhere else. My father and mother, since they are both dead, I shall be no nearer to in Essendean than in the Kingdom of Hungary, and, to speak truth, if I thought I had a chance to better myself where I was going I would go with a good will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy?\u201d said Mr. Campbell. \u201cVery well, Davie. Then it behoves me to tell your fortune; or so far as I may. When your mother was gone, and your father (the worthy, Christian man) began to sicken for his end, he gave me in charge a certain letter, which he said was your inheritance. \u2018So soon,\u2019 says he, \u2018as I am gone, and the house is redd up and the gear disposed of\u2019 (all which, Davie, hath been done), \u2018give my boy this letter into his hand, and start him off to the house of Shaws, not far from Cramond. That is the place I came from,\u2019 he said, \u2018and it\u2019s where it befits that my boy should return. He is a steady lad,\u2019 your father said, \u2018and a canny goer; and I doubt not he will come safe, and be well liked where he goes.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe house of Shaws!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhat had my poor father to do with the house of Shaws?\u201d\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d said Mr. Campbell, \u201cwho can tell that for a surety? But the name of that family, Davie, boy, is the name you bear--Balfours of Shaws: an ancient, honest, reputable house, peradventure in these latter days decayed. Your father, too, was a man of learning as befitted his position; no man more plausibly conducted school; nor had he the manner or the speech of a common dominie; but (as ye will yourself remember) I took aye a pleasure to have him to the manse to meet the gentry; and those of my own house, Campbell of Kilrennet, Campbell of Dunswire, Campbell of Minch, and others, all well-kenned gentlemen, had pleasure in his society. Lastly, to put all the elements of this affair before you, here is the testamentary letter itself, superscrived by the own hand of our departed brother.\u201d\n\nHe gave me the letter, which was addressed in these words: \u201cTo the hands of Ebenezer Balfour, Esquire, of Shaws, in his house of Shaws, these will be delivered by my son, David Balfour.\u201d My heart was beating hard at this great prospect now suddenly opening before a lad of seventeen years of age, the son of a poor country dominie in the Forest of Ettrick.\n\n\u201cMr. Campbell,\u201d I stammered, \u201cand if you were in my shoes, would you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf a surety,\u201d said the minister, \u201cthat would I, and without pause. A pretty lad like you should get to Cramond (which is near in by Edinburgh) in two days of walk. If the worst came to the worst, and your high relations (as I cannot but suppose them to be somewhat of your blood) should put you to the door, ye can but walk the two days back again and risp at the manse door. But I would rather hope that ye shall be well received, as your poor father forecast for you, and for anything that I ken come to be a great man in time. And here, Davie, laddie,\u201d he resumed, \u201cit lies near upon my conscience to improve this parting, and set you on the right guard against the dangers of the world.\u201d\n\nHere he cast about for a comfortable seat, lighted on a big boulder under a birch by the trackside, sate down upon it with a very long, serious upper lip, and the sun now shining in upon us between two peaks, put his pocket-handkerchief over his cocked hat to shelter him. There, then, with uplifted forefinger, he first put me on my guard against a considerable number of heresies, to which I had no temptation, and urged upon me to be instant in my prayers and reading of the Bible. That done, he drew a picture of the great house that I was bound to, and how I should conduct myself with its inhabitants.\n\n\u201cBe soople, Davie, in things immaterial,\u201d said he. \u201cBear ye this in mind, that, though gentle born, ye have had a country rearing. Dinnae shame us, Davie, dinnae shame us! In yon great, muckle house, with all these domestics, upper and under, show yourself as nice, as circumspect, as quick at the conception, and as slow of speech as any. As for the laird--remember he\u2019s the laird; I say no more: honour to whom honour. It\u2019s a pleasure to obey a laird; or should be, to the young.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d said I, \u201cit may be; and I\u2019ll promise you I\u2019ll try to make it so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, very well said,\u201d replied Mr. Campbell, heartily. \u201cAnd now to come to the material, or (to make a quibble) to the immaterial. I have here a little packet which contains four things.\u201d He tugged it, as he spoke, and with some great difficulty, from the skirt pocket of his coat. \u201cOf these four things, the first is your legal due: the little pickle money for your father\u2019s books and plenishing, which I have bought (as I have explained from the first) in the design of re-selling at a profit to the incoming dominie. The other three are gifties that Mrs. Campbell and myself would be blithe of your acceptance. The first, which is round, will likely please ye best at the first off-go; but, O Davie, laddie, it\u2019s but a drop of water in the sea; it\u2019ll help you but a step, and vanish like the morning. The second, which is flat and square and written upon, will stand by you through life, like a good staff for the road, and a good pillow to your head in sickness. And as for the last, which is cubical, that\u2019ll see you, it\u2019s my prayerful wish, into a better land.\u201d\n\nWith that he got upon his feet, took off his hat, and prayed a little while aloud, and in affecting terms, for a young man setting out into the world; then suddenly took me in his arms and embraced me very hard; then held me at arm\u2019s length, looking at me with his face all working with sorrow; and then whipped about, and crying good-bye to me, set off backward by the way that we had come at a sort of jogging run. It might have been laughable to another; but I was in no mind to laugh. I watched him as long as he was in sight; and he never stopped hurrying, nor once looked back. Then it came in upon my mind that this was all his sorrow at my departure; and my conscience smote me hard and fast, because I, for my part, was overjoyed to get away out of that quiet country-side, and go to a great, busy house, among rich and respected gentlefolk of my own name and blood.\n\n\u201cDavie, Davie,\u201d I thought, \u201cwas ever seen such black ingratitude? Can you forget old favours and old friends at the mere whistle of a name? Fie, fie; think shame.\u201d\n\nAnd I sat down on the boulder the good man had just left, and opened the parcel to see the nature of my gifts. That which he had called cubical, I had never had much doubt of; sure enough it was a little Bible, to carry in a plaid-neuk. That which he had called round, I found to be a shilling piece; and the third, which was to help me so wonderfully both in health and sickness all the days of my life, was a little piece of coarse yellow paper, written upon thus in red ink:\n\n\u201cTO MAKE LILLY OF THE VALLEY WATER.--Take the flowers of lilly of the valley and distil them in sack, and drink a spooneful or two as there is occasion. It restores speech to those that have the dumb palsey. It is good against the Gout; it comforts the heart and strengthens the memory; and the flowers, put into a Glasse, close stopt, and set into ane hill of ants for a month, then take it out, and you will find a liquor which comes from the flowers, which keep in a vial; it is good, ill or well, and whether man or woman.\u201d\n\n\nAnd then, in the minister\u2019s own hand, was added:\n\n\u201cLikewise for sprains, rub it in; and for the cholic, a great spooneful in the hour.\u201d\n\n\nTo be sure, I laughed over this; but it was rather tremulous laughter; and I was glad to get my bundle on my staff\u2019s end and set out over the ford and up the hill upon the farther side; till, just as I came on the green drove-road running wide through the heather, I took my last look of Kirk Essendean, the trees about the manse, and the big rowans in the kirkyard where my father and my mother lay.",
    "As soon as we came to the inn, Ransome led us up the stair to a small room, with a bed in it, and heated like an oven by a great fire of coal. At a table hard by the chimney, a tall, dark, sober-looking man sat writing. In spite of the heat of the room, he wore a thick sea-jacket, buttoned to the neck, and a tall hairy cap drawn down over his ears; yet I never saw any man, not even a judge upon the bench, look cooler, or more studious and self-possessed, than this ship-captain.\n\nHe got to his feet at once, and coming forward, offered his large hand to Ebenezer. \u201cI am proud to see you, Mr. Balfour,\u201d said he, in a fine deep voice, \u201cand glad that ye are here in time. The wind\u2019s fair, and the tide upon the turn; we\u2019ll see the old coal-bucket burning on the Isle of May before to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaptain Hoseason,\u201d returned my uncle, \u201cyou keep your room unco hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a habit I have, Mr. Balfour,\u201d said the skipper. \u201cI\u2019m a cold-rife man by my nature; I have a cold blood, sir. There\u2019s neither fur, nor flannel--no, sir, nor hot rum, will warm up what they call the temperature. Sir, it\u2019s the same with most men that have been carbonadoed, as they call it, in the tropic seas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, well, captain,\u201d replied my uncle, \u201cwe must all be the way we\u2019re made.\u201d\n\nBut it chanced that this fancy of the captain\u2019s had a great share in my misfortunes. For though I had promised myself not to let my kinsman out of sight, I was both so impatient for a nearer look of the sea, and so sickened by the closeness of the room, that when he told me to \u201crun down-stairs and play myself awhile,\u201d I was fool enough to take him at his word.\n\nAway I went, therefore, leaving the two men sitting down to a bottle and a great mass of papers; and crossing the road in front of the inn, walked down upon the beach. With the wind in that quarter, only little wavelets, not much bigger than I had seen upon a lake, beat upon the shore. But the weeds were new to me--some green, some brown and long, and some with little bladders that crackled between my fingers. Even so far up the firth, the smell of the sea-water was exceedingly salt and stirring; the _Covenant_, besides, was beginning to shake out her sails, which hung upon the yards in clusters; and the spirit of all that I beheld put me in thoughts of far voyages and foreign places.\n\nI looked, too, at the seamen with the skiff--big brown fellows, some in shirts, some with jackets, some with coloured handkerchiefs about their throats, one with a brace of pistols stuck into his pockets, two or three with knotty bludgeons, and all with their case-knives. I passed the time of day with one that looked less desperate than his fellows, and asked him of the sailing of the brig. He said they would get under way as soon as the ebb set, and expressed his gladness to be out of a port where there were no taverns and fiddlers; but all with such horrifying oaths, that I made haste to get away from him.\n\nThis threw me back on Ransome, who seemed the least wicked of that gang, and who soon came out of the inn and ran to me, crying for a bowl of punch. I told him I would give him no such thing, for neither he nor I was of an age for such indulgences. \u201cBut a glass of ale you may have, and welcome,\u201d said I. He mopped and mowed at me, and called me names; but he was glad to get the ale, for all that; and presently we were set down at a table in the front room of the inn, and both eating and drinking with a good appetite.\n\nHere it occurred to me that, as the landlord was a man of that county, I might do well to make a friend of him. I offered him a share, as was much the custom in those days; but he was far too great a man to sit with such poor customers as Ransome and myself, and he was leaving the room, when I called him back to ask if he knew Mr. Rankeillor.\n\n\u201cHoot, ay,\u201d says he, \u201cand a very honest man. And, O, by-the-by,\u201d says he, \u201cwas it you that came in with Ebenezer?\u201d And when I had told him yes, \u201cYe\u2019ll be no friend of his?\u201d he asked, meaning, in the Scottish way, that I would be no relative.\n\nI told him no, none.\n\n\u201cI thought not,\u201d said he, \u201cand yet ye have a kind of gliff of Mr. Alexander.\u201d\n\nI said it seemed that Ebenezer was ill-seen in the country.\n\n\u201cNae doubt,\u201d said the landlord. \u201cHe\u2019s a wicked auld man, and there\u2019s many would like to see him girning in the tow. Jennet Clouston and mony mair that he has harried out of house and hame. And yet he was ance a fine young fellow, too. But that was before the sough gaed abroad about Mr. Alexander, that was like the death of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what was it?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOu, just that he had killed him,\u201d said the landlord. \u201cDid ye never hear that?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what would he kill him for?\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cAnd what for, but just to get the place,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cThe place?\u201d said I. \u201cThe Shaws?\u201d\n\n\u201cNae other place that I ken,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cAy, man?\u201d said I. \u201cIs that so? Was my--was Alexander the eldest son?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Deed was he,\u201d said the landlord. \u201cWhat else would he have killed him for?\u201d\n\nAnd with that he went away, as he had been impatient to do from the beginning.\n\nOf course, I had guessed it a long while ago; but it is one thing to guess, another to know; and I sat stunned with my good fortune, and could scarce grow to believe that the same poor lad who had trudged in the dust from Ettrick Forest not two days ago, was now one of the rich of the earth, and had a house and broad lands, and might mount his horse tomorrow. All these pleasant things, and a thousand others, crowded into my mind, as I sat staring before me out of the inn window, and paying no heed to what I saw; only I remember that my eye lighted on Captain Hoseason down on the pier among his seamen, and speaking with some authority. And presently he came marching back towards the house, with no mark of a sailor\u2019s clumsiness, but carrying his fine, tall figure with a manly bearing, and still with the same sober, grave expression on his face. I wondered if it was possible that Ransome\u2019s stories could be true, and half disbelieved them; they fitted so ill with the man\u2019s looks. But indeed, he was neither so good as I supposed him, nor quite so bad as Ransome did; for, in fact, he was two men, and left the better one behind as soon as he set foot on board his vessel.\n\nThe next thing, I heard my uncle calling me, and found the pair in the road together. It was the captain who addressed me, and that with an air (very flattering to a young lad) of grave equality.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said he, \u201cMr. Balfour tells me great things of you; and for my own part, I like your looks. I wish I was for longer here, that we might make the better friends; but we\u2019ll make the most of what we have. Ye shall come on board my brig for half an hour, till the ebb sets, and drink a bowl with me.\u201d\n\nNow, I longed to see the inside of a ship more than words can tell; but I was not going to put myself in jeopardy, and I told him my uncle and I had an appointment with a lawyer.\n\n\u201cAy, ay,\u201d said he, \u201che passed me word of that. But, ye see, the boat\u2019ll set ye ashore at the town pier, and that\u2019s but a penny stonecast from Rankeillor\u2019s house.\u201d And here he suddenly leaned down and whispered in my ear: \u201cTake care of the old tod; he means mischief. Come aboard till I can get a word with ye.\u201d And then, passing his arm through mine, he continued aloud, as he set off towards his boat: \u201cBut, come, what can I bring ye from the Carolinas? Any friend of Mr. Balfour\u2019s can command. A roll of tobacco? Indian feather-work? a skin of a wild beast? a stone pipe? the mocking-bird that mews for all the world like a cat? the cardinal bird that is as red as blood?--take your pick and say your pleasure.\u201d\n\nBy this time we were at the boat-side, and he was handing me in. I did not dream of hanging back; I thought (the poor fool!) that I had found a good friend and helper, and I was rejoiced to see the ship. As soon as we were all set in our places, the boat was thrust off from the pier and began to move over the waters: and what with my pleasure in this new movement and my surprise at our low position, and the appearance of the shores, and the growing bigness of the brig as we drew near to it, I could hardly understand what the captain said, and must have answered him at random.\n\nAs soon as we were alongside (where I sat fairly gaping at the ship\u2019s height, the strong humming of the tide against its sides, and the pleasant cries of the seamen at their work) Hoseason, declaring that he and I must be the first aboard, ordered a tackle to be sent down from the main-yard. In this I was whipped into the air and set down again on the deck, where the captain stood ready waiting for me, and instantly slipped back his arm under mine. There I stood some while, a little dizzy with the unsteadiness of all around me, perhaps a little afraid, and yet vastly pleased with these strange sights; the captain meanwhile pointing out the strangest, and telling me their names and uses.\n\n\u201cBut where is my uncle?\u201d said I suddenly.\n\n\u201cAy,\u201d said Hoseason, with a sudden grimness, \u201cthat\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nI felt I was lost. With all my strength, I plucked myself clear of him and ran to the bulwarks. Sure enough, there was the boat pulling for the town, with my uncle sitting in the stern. I gave a piercing cry--\u201cHelp, help! Murder!\u201d--so that both sides of the anchorage rang with it, and my uncle turned round where he was sitting, and showed me a face full of cruelty and terror.\n\nIt was the last I saw. Already strong hands had been plucking me back from the ship\u2019s side; and now a thunderbolt seemed to strike me; I saw a great flash of fire, and fell senseless.",
    "One night, about eleven o\u2019clock, a man of Mr. Riach\u2019s watch (which was on deck) came below for his jacket; and instantly there began to go a whisper about the forecastle that \u201cShuan had done for him at last.\u201d There was no need of a name; we all knew who was meant; but we had scarce time to get the idea rightly in our heads, far less to speak of it, when the scuttle was again flung open, and Captain Hoseason came down the ladder. He looked sharply round the bunks in the tossing light of the lantern; and then, walking straight up to me, he addressed me, to my surprise, in tones of kindness.\n\n\u201cMy man,\u201d said he, \u201cwe want ye to serve in the round-house. You and Ransome are to change berths. Run away aft with ye.\u201d\n\nEven as he spoke, two seamen appeared in the scuttle, carrying Ransome in their arms; and the ship at that moment giving a great sheer into the sea, and the lantern swinging, the light fell direct on the boy\u2019s face. It was as white as wax, and had a look upon it like a dreadful smile. The blood in me ran cold, and I drew in my breath as if I had been struck.\n\n\u201cRun away aft; run away aft with ye!\u201d cried Hoseason.\n\nAnd at that I brushed by the sailors and the boy (who neither spoke nor moved), and ran up the ladder on deck.\n\nThe brig was sheering swiftly and giddily through a long, cresting swell. She was on the starboard tack, and on the left hand, under the arched foot of the foresail, I could see the sunset still quite bright. This, at such an hour of the night, surprised me greatly; but I was too ignorant to draw the true conclusion--that we were going north-about round Scotland, and were now on the high sea between the Orkney and Shetland Islands, having avoided the dangerous currents of the Pentland Firth. For my part, who had been so long shut in the dark and knew nothing of head-winds, I thought we might be half-way or more across the Atlantic. And indeed (beyond that I wondered a little at the lateness of the sunset light) I gave no heed to it, and pushed on across the decks, running between the seas, catching at ropes, and only saved from going overboard by one of the hands on deck, who had been always kind to me.\n\nThe round-house, for which I was bound, and where I was now to sleep and serve, stood some six feet above the decks, and considering the size of the brig, was of good dimensions. Inside were a fixed table and bench, and two berths, one for the captain and the other for the two mates, turn and turn about. It was all fitted with lockers from top to bottom, so as to stow away the officers\u2019 belongings and a part of the ship\u2019s stores; there was a second store-room underneath, which you entered by a hatchway in the middle of the deck; indeed, all the best of the meat and drink and the whole of the powder were collected in this place; and all the firearms, except the two pieces of brass ordnance, were set in a rack in the aftermost wall of the round-house. The most of the cutlasses were in another place.\n\nA small window with a shutter on each side, and a skylight in the roof, gave it light by day; and after dark there was a lamp always burning. It was burning when I entered, not brightly, but enough to show Mr. Shuan sitting at the table, with the brandy bottle and a tin pannikin in front of him. He was a tall man, strongly made and very black; and he stared before him on the table like one stupid.\n\nHe took no notice of my coming in; nor did he move when the captain followed and leant on the berth beside me, looking darkly at the mate. I stood in great fear of Hoseason, and had my reasons for it; but something told me I need not be afraid of him just then; and I whispered in his ear: \u201cHow is he?\u201d He shook his head like one that does not know and does not wish to think, and his face was very stern.\n\nPresently Mr. Riach came in. He gave the captain a glance that meant the boy was dead as plain as speaking, and took his place like the rest of us; so that we all three stood without a word, staring down at Mr. Shuan, and Mr. Shuan (on his side) sat without a word, looking hard upon the table.\n\nAll of a sudden he put out his hand to take the bottle; and at that Mr. Riach started forward and caught it away from him, rather by surprise than violence, crying out, with an oath, that there had been too much of this work altogether, and that a judgment would fall upon the ship. And as he spoke (the weather sliding-doors standing open) he tossed the bottle into the sea.\n\nMr. Shuan was on his feet in a trice; he still looked dazed, but he meant murder, ay, and would have done it, for the second time that night, had not the captain stepped in between him and his victim.\n\n\u201cSit down!\u201d roars the captain. \u201cYe sot and swine, do ye know what ye\u2019ve done? Ye\u2019ve murdered the boy!\u201d\n\nMr. Shuan seemed to understand; for he sat down again, and put up his hand to his brow.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201che brought me a dirty pannikin!\u201d\n\nAt that word, the captain and I and Mr. Riach all looked at each other for a second with a kind of frightened look; and then Hoseason walked up to his chief officer, took him by the shoulder, led him across to his bunk, and bade him lie down and go to sleep, as you might speak to a bad child. The murderer cried a little, but he took off his sea-boots and obeyed.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d cried Mr. Riach, with a dreadful voice, \u201cye should have interfered long syne. It\u2019s too late now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Riach,\u201d said the captain, \u201cthis night\u2019s work must never be kennt in Dysart. The boy went overboard, sir; that\u2019s what the story is; and I would give five pounds out of my pocket it was true!\u201d He turned to the table. \u201cWhat made ye throw the good bottle away?\u201d he added. \u201cThere was nae sense in that, sir. Here, David, draw me another. They\u2019re in the bottom locker;\u201d and he tossed me a key. \u201cYe\u2019ll need a glass yourself, sir,\u201d he added to Riach. \u201cYon was an ugly thing to see.\u201d\n\nSo the pair sat down and hob-a-nobbed; and while they did so, the murderer, who had been lying and whimpering in his berth, raised himself upon his elbow and looked at them and at me.",
    "But now our time of truce was come to an end. Those on deck had waited for my coming till they grew impatient; and scarce had Alan spoken, when the captain showed face in the open door. \u201cStand!\u201d cried Alan, and pointed his sword at him. The captain stood, indeed; but he neither winced nor drew back a foot. \u201cA naked sword?\u201d says he. \u201cThis is a strange return for hospitality.\u201d \u201cDo ye see me?\u201d said Alan. \u201cI am come of kings; I bear a king\u2019s name. My badge is the oak. Do ye see my sword? It has slashed the heads off mair Whigamores than you have toes upon your feet. Call up your vermin to your back, sir, and fall on! The sooner the clash begins, the sooner ye\u2019ll taste this steel throughout your vitals.\u201d The captain said nothing to Alan, but he looked over at me with an ugly look. \u201cDavid,\u201d said he, \u201cI\u2019ll mind this;\u201d and the sound of his voice went through me with a jar. Next moment he was gone. \u201cAnd now,\u201d said Alan, \u201clet your hand keep your head, for the grip is coming.\u201d\n\nAlan drew a dirk, which he held in his left hand in case they should run in under his sword. I, on my part, clambered up into the berth with an armful of pistols and something of a heavy heart, and set open the window where I was to watch. It was a small part of the deck that I could overlook, but enough for our purpose. The sea had gone down, and the wind was steady and kept the sails quiet; so that there was a great stillness in the ship, in which I made sure I heard the sound of muttering voices. A little after, and there came a clash of steel upon the deck, by which I knew they were dealing out the cutlasses and one had been let fall; and after that, silence again. I do not know if I was what you call afraid; but my heart beat like a bird\u2019s, both quick and little; and there was a dimness came before my eyes which I continually rubbed away, and which continually returned. As for hope, I had none; but only a darkness of despair and a sort of anger against all the world that made me long to sell my life as dear as I was able. I tried to pray, I remember, but that same hurry of my mind, like a man running, would not suffer me to think upon the words; and my chief wish was to have the thing begin and be done with it.\n\nIt came all of a sudden when it did, with a rush of feet and a roar, and then a shout from Alan, and a sound of blows and some one crying out as if hurt. I looked back over my shoulder, and saw Mr. Shuan in the doorway, crossing blades with Alan. \u201cThat\u2019s him that killed the boy!\u201d I cried. \u201cLook to your window!\u201d said Alan; and as I turned back to my place, I saw him pass his sword through the mate\u2019s body. It was none too soon for me to look to my own part; for my head was scarce back at the window, before five men, carrying a spare yard for a battering-ram, ran past me and took post to drive the door in. I had never fired with a pistol in my life, and not often with a gun; far less against a fellow-creature. But it was now or never; and just as they swung the yard, I cried out: \u201cTake that!\u201d and shot into their midst.\n\nI must have hit one of them, for he sang out and gave back a step, and the rest stopped as if a little disconcerted. Before they had time to recover, I sent another ball over their heads; and at my third shot (which went as wide as the second) the whole party threw down the yard and ran for it. Then I looked round again into the deck-house. The whole place was full of the smoke of my own firing, just as my ears seemed to be burst with the noise of the shots. But there was Alan, standing as before; only now his sword was running blood to the hilt, and himself so swelled with triumph and fallen into so fine an attitude, that he looked to be invincible. Right before him on the floor was Mr. Shuan, on his hands and knees; the blood was pouring from his mouth, and he was sinking slowly lower, with a terrible, white face; and just as I looked, some of those from behind caught hold of him by the heels and dragged him bodily out of the round-house. I believe he died as they were doing it. \u201cThere\u2019s one of your Whigs for ye!\u201d cried Alan; and then turning to me, he asked if I had done much execution.\n\nI told him I had winged one, and thought it was the captain. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve settled two,\u201d says he. \u201cNo, there\u2019s not enough blood let; they\u2019ll be back again. To your watch, David. This was but a dram before meat.\u201d I settled back to my place, re-charging the three pistols I had fired, and keeping watch with both eye and ear. Our enemies were disputing not far off upon the deck, and that so loudly that I could hear a word or two above the washing of the seas. \u201cIt was Shuan bauchled it,\u201d I heard one say. And another answered him with a \u201cWheesht, man! He\u2019s paid the piper.\u201d After that the voices fell again into the same muttering as before. Only now, one person spoke most of the time, as though laying down a plan, and first one and then another answered him briefly, like men taking orders. By this, I made sure they were coming on again, and told Alan. \u201cIt\u2019s what we have to pray for,\u201d said he. \u201cUnless we can give them a good distaste of us, and done with it, there\u2019ll be nae sleep for either you or me. But this time, mind, they\u2019ll be in earnest.\u201d\n\nBy this, my pistols were ready, and there was nothing to do but listen and wait. While the brush lasted, I had not the time to think if I was frighted; but now, when all was still again, my mind ran upon nothing else. The thought of the sharp swords and the cold steel was strong in me; and presently, when I began to hear stealthy steps and a brushing of men\u2019s clothes against the round-house wall, and knew they were taking their places in the dark, I could have found it in my mind to cry out aloud. All this was upon Alan\u2019s side; and I had begun to think my share of the fight was at an end, when I heard some one drop softly on the roof above me. Then there came a single call on the sea-pipe, and that was the signal. A knot of them made one rush of it, cutlass in hand, against the door; and at the same moment, the glass of the skylight was dashed in a thousand pieces, and a man leaped through and landed on the floor. Before he got his feet, I had clapped a pistol to his back, and might have shot him, too; only at the touch of him (and him alive) my whole flesh misgave me, and I could no more pull the trigger than I could have flown.\n\nHe had dropped his cutlass as he jumped, and when he felt the pistol, whipped straight round and laid hold of me, roaring out an oath; and at that either my courage came again, or I grew so much afraid as came to the same thing; for I gave a shriek and shot him in the midst of the body. He gave the most horrible, ugly groan and fell to the floor. The foot of a second fellow, whose legs were dangling through the skylight, struck me at the same time upon the head; and at that I snatched another pistol and shot this one through the thigh, so that he slipped through and tumbled in a lump on his companion\u2019s body. There was no talk of missing, any more than there was time to aim; I clapped the muzzle to the very place and fired. I might have stood and stared at them for long, but I heard Alan shout as if for help, and that brought me to my senses. He had kept the door so long; but one of the seamen, while he was engaged with others, had run in under his guard and caught him about the body. Alan was dirking him with his left hand, but the fellow clung like a leech. Another had broken in and had his cutlass raised. The door was thronged with their faces. I thought we were lost, and catching up my cutlass, fell on them in flank.\n\nBut I had not time to be of help. The wrestler dropped at last; and Alan, leaping back to get his distance, ran upon the others like a bull, roaring as he went. They broke before him like water, turning, and running, and falling one against another in their haste. The sword in his hands flashed like quicksilver into the huddle of our fleeing enemies; and at every flash there came the scream of a man hurt. I was still thinking we were lost, when lo! they were all gone, and Alan was driving them along the deck as a sheep-dog chases sheep. Yet he was no sooner out than he was back again, being as cautious as he was brave; and meanwhile the seamen continued running and crying out as if he was still behind them; and we heard them tumble one upon another into the forecastle, and clap-to the hatch upon the top. The round-house was like a shambles; three were dead inside, another lay in his death agony across the threshold; and there were Alan and I victorious and unhurt.",
    "\u201cWhat,\u201d cried I, \u201cwere you in the English army?\u201d \u201cThat was I,\u201d said Alan. \u201cBut I deserted to the right side at Preston Pans--and that\u2019s some comfort.\u201d I could scarcely share this view: holding desertion under arms for an unpardonable fault in honour. But for all I was so young, I was wiser than say my thought. \u201cDear, dear,\u201d says I, \u201cthe punishment is death.\u201d \u201cAy\u201d said he, \u201cif they got hands on me, it would be a short shrift and a lang tow for Alan! But I have the King of France\u2019s commission in my pocket, which would aye be some protection.\u201d \u201cI misdoubt it much,\u201d said I. \u201cI have doubts mysel\u2019,\u201d said Alan drily.\n\n\u201cAnd, good heaven, man,\u201d cried I, \u201cyou that are a condemned rebel, and a deserter, and a man of the French King\u2019s--what tempts ye back into this country? It\u2019s a braving of Providence.\u201d \u201cTut!\u201d says Alan, \u201cI have been back every year since forty-six!\u201d \u201cAnd what brings ye, man?\u201d cried I. \u201cWell, ye see, I weary for my friends and country,\u201d said he. \u201cFrance is a braw place, nae doubt; but I weary for the heather and the deer. And then I have bit things that I attend to. Whiles I pick up a few lads to serve the King of France: recruits, ye see; and that\u2019s aye a little money. But the heart of the matter is the business of my chief, Ardshiel.\u201d \u201cI thought they called your chief Appin,\u201d said I. \u201cAy, but Ardshiel is the captain of the clan,\u201d said he, which scarcely cleared my mind. \u201cYe see, David, he that was all his life so great a man, and come of the blood and bearing the name of kings, is now brought down to live in a French town like a poor and private person. He that had four hundred swords at his whistle, I have seen, with these eyes of mine, buying butter in the market-place, and taking it home in a kale-leaf. This is not only a pain but a disgrace to us of his family and clan. There are the bairns forby, the children and the hope of Appin, that must be learned their letters and how to hold a sword, in that far country. Now, the tenants of Appin have to pay a rent to King George; but their hearts are staunch, they are true to their chief; and what with love and a bit of pressure, and maybe a threat or two, the poor folk scrape up a second rent for Ardshiel. Well, David, I\u2019m the hand that carries it.\u201d And he struck the belt about his body, so that the guineas rang.\n\n\u201cDo they pay both?\u201d cried I. \u201cAy, David, both,\u201d says he. \u201cWhat! two rents?\u201d I repeated. \u201cAy, David,\u201d said he. \u201cI told a different tale to yon captain man; but this is the truth of it. And it\u2019s wonderful to me how little pressure is needed. But that\u2019s the handiwork of my good kinsman and my father\u2019s friend, James of the Glens: James Stewart, that is: Ardshiel\u2019s half-brother. He it is that gets the money in, and does the management.\u201d This was the first time I heard the name of that James Stewart, who was afterwards so famous at the time of his hanging. But I took little heed at the moment, for all my mind was occupied with the generosity of these poor Highlanders. \u201cI call it noble,\u201d I cried. \u201cI\u2019m a Whig, or little better; but I call it noble.\u201d \u201cAy\u201d said he, \u201cye\u2019re a Whig, but ye\u2019re a gentleman; and that\u2019s what does it. Now, if ye were one of the cursed race of Campbell, ye would gnash your teeth to hear tell of it. If ye were the Red Fox...\u201d And at that name, his teeth shut together, and he ceased speaking. I have seen many a grim face, but never a grimmer than Alan\u2019s when he had named the Red Fox.\n\n\u201cAnd who is the Red Fox?\u201d I asked, daunted, but still curious. \u201cWho is he?\u201d cried Alan. \u201cWell, and I\u2019ll tell you that. When the men of the clans were broken at Culloden, and the good cause went down, and the horses rode over the fetlocks in the best blood of the north, Ardshiel had to flee like a poor deer upon the mountains--he and his lady and his bairns. A sair job we had of it before we got him shipped; and while he still lay in the heather, the English rogues, that couldnae come at his life, were striking at his rights. They stripped him of his powers; they stripped him of his lands; they plucked the weapons from the hands of his clansmen, that had borne arms for thirty centuries; ay, and the very clothes off their backs--so that it\u2019s now a sin to wear a tartan plaid, and a man may be cast into a gaol if he has but a kilt about his legs. One thing they couldnae kill. That was the love the clansmen bore their chief. These guineas are the proof of it. And now, in there steps a man, a Campbell, red-headed Colin of Glenure----\u201d \u201cIs that him you call the Red Fox?\u201d said I. \u201cWill ye bring me his brush?\u201d cries Alan, fiercely. \u201cAy, that\u2019s the man. In he steps, and gets papers from King George, to be so-called King\u2019s factor on the lands of Appin. And at first he sings small, and is hail-fellow-well-met with Sheamus--that\u2019s James of the Glens, my chieftain\u2019s agent. But by-and-by, that came to his ears that I have just told you; how the poor commons of Appin, the farmers and the crofters and the boumen, were wringing their very plaids to get a second rent, and send it over-seas for Ardshiel and his poor bairns. What was it ye called it, when I told ye?\u201d\n\n\u201cI called it noble, Alan,\u201d said I. \u201cAnd you little better than a common Whig!\u201d cries Alan. \u201cBut when it came to Colin Roy, the black Campbell blood in him ran wild. He sat gnashing his teeth at the wine table. What! should a Stewart get a bite of bread, and him not be able to prevent it? Ah! Red Fox, if ever I hold you at a gun\u2019s end, the Lord have pity upon ye!\u201d (Alan stopped to swallow down his anger.) \u201cWell, David, what does he do? He declares all the farms to let. And, thinks he, in his black heart, \u2018I\u2019ll soon get other tenants that\u2019ll overbid these Stewarts, and Maccolls, and Macrobs\u2019 (for these are all names in my clan, David); \u2018and then,\u2019 thinks he, \u2018Ardshiel will have to hold his bonnet on a French roadside.\u2019\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cwhat followed?\u201d Alan laid down his pipe, which he had long since suffered to go out, and set his two hands upon his knees.",
    "With my stepping ashore I began the most unhappy part of my adventures. It was half-past twelve in the morning, and though the wind was broken by the land, it was a cold night. I dared not sit down (for I thought I should have frozen), but took off my shoes and walked to and fro upon the sand, bare-foot, and beating my breast with infinite weariness. There was no sound of man or cattle; not a cock crew, though it was about the hour of their first waking; only the surf broke outside in the distance, which put me in mind of my perils and those of my friend. To walk by the sea at that hour of the morning, and in a place so desert-like and lonesome, struck me with a kind of fear.\n\nAs soon as the day began to break I put on my shoes and climbed a hill--the ruggedest scramble I ever undertook--falling, the whole way, between big blocks of granite, or leaping from one to another. When I got to the top the dawn was come. There was no sign of the brig, which must have lifted from the reef and sunk. The boat, too, was nowhere to be seen. There was never a sail upon the ocean; and in what I could see of the land was neither house nor man. I was afraid to think what had befallen my shipmates, and afraid to look longer at so empty a scene. What with my wet clothes and weariness, and my belly that now began to ache with hunger, I had enough to trouble me without that. So I set off eastward along the south coast, hoping to find a house where I might warm myself, and perhaps get news of those I had lost. And at the worst, I considered the sun would soon rise and dry my clothes.\n\nAfter a little, my way was stopped by a creek or inlet of the sea, which seemed to run pretty deep into the land; and as I had no means to get across, I must needs change my direction to go about the end of it. It was still the roughest kind of walking; indeed the whole, not only of Earraid, but of the neighbouring part of Mull (which they call the Ross) is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among. At first the creek kept narrowing as I had looked to see; but presently to my surprise it began to widen out again. At this I scratched my head, but had still no notion of the truth: until at last I came to a rising ground, and it burst upon me all in a moment that I was cast upon a little barren isle, and cut off on every side by the salt seas.\n\nInstead of the sun rising to dry me, it came on to rain, with a thick mist; so that my case was lamentable. I stood in the rain, and shivered, and wondered what to do, till it occurred to me that perhaps the creek was fordable. Back I went to the narrowest point and waded in. But not three yards from shore, I plumped in head over ears; and if ever I was heard of more, it was rather by God\u2019s grace than my own prudence. I was no wetter (for that could hardly be), but I was all the colder for this mishap; and having lost another hope was the more unhappy. And now, all at once, the yard came in my head. What had carried me through the roost would surely serve me to cross this little quiet creek in safety. With that I set off, undaunted, across the top of the isle, to fetch and carry it back. It was a weary tramp in all ways, and if hope had not buoyed me up, I must have cast myself down and given up. Whether with the sea salt, or because I was growing fevered, I was distressed with thirst, and had to stop, as I went, and drink the peaty water out of the hags.\n\nI came to the bay at last, more dead than alive; and at the first glance, I thought the yard was something farther out than when I left it. In I went, for the third time, into the sea. The sand was smooth and firm, and shelved gradually down, so that I could wade out till the water was almost to my neck and the little waves splashed into my face. But at that depth my feet began to leave me, and I durst venture in no farther. As for the yard, I saw it bobbing very quietly some twenty feet beyond. I had borne up well until this last disappointment; but at that I came ashore, and flung myself down upon the sands and wept.\n\nThe time I spent upon the island is still so horrible a thought to me, that I must pass it lightly over. In all the books I have read of people cast away, they had either their pockets full of tools, or a chest of things would be thrown upon the beach along with them, as if on purpose. My case was very different. I had nothing in my pockets but money and Alan\u2019s silver button; and being inland bred, I was as much short of knowledge as of means. I knew indeed that shell-fish were counted good to eat; and among the rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets, which at first I could scarcely strike from their places, not knowing quickness to be needful. There were, besides, some of the little shells that we call buckies; I think periwinkle is the English name. Of these two I made my whole diet, devouring them cold and raw as I found them; and so hungry was I, that at first they seemed to me delicious. Perhaps they were out of season, or perhaps there was something wrong in the sea about my island. But at least I had no sooner eaten my first meal than I was seized with giddiness and retching, and lay for a long time no better than dead. A second trial of the same food (indeed I had no other) did better with me, and revived my strength. But as long as I was on the island, I never knew what to expect when I had eaten; sometimes all was well, and sometimes I was thrown into a miserable sickness; nor could I ever distinguish what particular fish it was that hurt me.\n\nAll day it streamed rain; the island ran like a sop, there was no dry spot to be found; and when I lay down that night, between two boulders that made a kind of roof, my feet were in a bog. The second day I crossed the island to all sides. There was no one part of it better than another; it was all desolate and rocky; nothing living on it but game birds which I lacked the means to kill, and the gulls which haunted the outlying rocks in a prodigious number. But the creek, or strait, that cut off the isle from the main-land of the Ross, opened out on the north into a bay, and the bay again opened into the Sound of Iona; and it was the neighbourhood of this place that I chose to be my home; though if I had thought upon the very name of home in such a spot, I must have burst out weeping.",
    "I asked my boatman what it should be, and he answered he supposed it was some of the red soldiers coming from Fort William into Appin, against the poor tenantry of the country. Well, it was a sad sight to me; and whether it was because of my thoughts of Alan, or from something prophetic in my bosom, although this was but the second time I had seen King George\u2019s troops, I had no good will to them.\n\nAt last we came so near the point of land at the entering in of Loch Leven that I begged to be set on shore. My boatman (who was an honest fellow and mindful of his promise to the catechist) would fain have carried me on to Balachulish; but as this was to take me farther from my secret destination, I insisted, and was set on shore at last under the wood of Lettermore (or Lettervore, for I have heard it both ways) in Alan\u2019s country of Appin.\n\nThis was a wood of birches, growing on a steep, craggy side of a mountain that overhung the loch. It had many openings and ferny howes; and a road or bridle track ran north and south through the midst of it, by the edge of which, where was a spring, I sat down to eat some oat-bread of Mr. Henderland\u2019s and think upon my situation.\n\nHere I was not only troubled by a cloud of stinging midges, but far more by the doubts of my mind. What I ought to do, why I was going to join myself with an outlaw and a would-be murderer like Alan, whether I should not be acting more like a man of sense to tramp back to the south country direct, by my own guidance and at my own charges, and what Mr. Campbell or even Mr. Henderland would think of me if they should ever learn my folly and presumption: these were the doubts that now began to come in on me stronger than ever.\n\nAs I was so sitting and thinking, a sound of men and horses came to me through the wood; and presently after, at a turning of the road, I saw four travellers come into view. The way was in this part so rough and narrow that they came single and led their horses by the reins. The first was a great, red-headed gentleman, of an imperious and flushed face, who carried his hat in his hand and fanned himself, for he was in a breathing heat. The second, by his decent black garb and white wig, I correctly took to be a lawyer. The third was a servant, and wore some part of his clothes in tartan, which showed that his master was of a Highland family, and either an outlaw or else in singular good odour with the Government, since the wearing of tartan was against the Act. If I had been better versed in these things, I would have known the tartan to be of the Argyle (or Campbell) colours. This servant had a good-sized portmanteau strapped on his horse, and a net of lemons (to brew punch with) hanging at the saddle-bow; as was often enough the custom with luxurious travellers in that part of the country.\n\nAs for the fourth, who brought up the tail, I had seen his like before, and knew him at once to be a sheriff\u2019s officer.\n\nI had no sooner seen these people coming than I made up my mind (for no reason that I can tell) to go through with my adventure; and when the first came alongside of me, I rose up from the bracken and asked him the way to Aucharn.\n\nHe stopped and looked at me, as I thought, a little oddly; and then, turning to the lawyer, \u201cMungo,\u201d said he, \u201cthere\u2019s many a man would think this more of a warning than two pyats. Here am I on my road to Duror on the job ye ken; and here is a young lad starts up out of the bracken, and speers if I am on the way to Aucharn.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlenure,\u201d said the other, \u201cthis is an ill subject for jesting.\u201d\n\nThese two had now drawn close up and were gazing at me, while the two followers had halted about a stone-cast in the rear.\n\n\u201cAnd what seek ye in Aucharn?\u201d said Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure, him they called the Red Fox; for he it was that I had stopped.\n\n\u201cThe man that lives there,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cJames of the Glens,\u201d says Glenure, musingly; and then to the lawyer: \u201cIs he gathering his people, think ye?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d says the lawyer, \u201cwe shall do better to bide where we are, and let the soldiers rally us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are concerned for me,\u201d said I, \u201cI am neither of his people nor yours, but an honest subject of King George, owing no man and fearing no man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, very well said,\u201d replies the Factor. \u201cBut if I may make so bold as ask, what does this honest man so far from his country? and why does he come seeking the brother of Ardshiel? I have power here, I must tell you. I am King\u2019s Factor upon several of these estates, and have twelve files of soldiers at my back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard a waif word in the country,\u201d said I, a little nettled, \u201cthat you were a hard man to drive.\u201d\n\nHe still kept looking at me, as if in doubt.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said he, at last, \u201cyour tongue is bold; but I am no unfriend to plainness. If ye had asked me the way to the door of James Stewart on any other day but this, I would have set ye right and bidden ye God speed. But to-day--eh, Mungo?\u201d And he turned again to look at the lawyer.\n\nBut just as he turned there came the shot of a firelock from higher up the hill; and with the very sound of it Glenure fell upon the road.\n\n\u201cO, I am dead!\u201d he cried, several times over.\n\nThe lawyer had caught him up and held him in his arms, the servant standing over and clasping his hands. And now the wounded man looked from one to another with scared eyes, and there was a change in his voice, that went to the heart.\n\n\u201cTake care of yourselves,\u201d says he. \u201cI am dead.\u201d\n\nHe tried to open his clothes as if to look for the wound, but his fingers slipped on the buttons. With that he gave a great sigh, his head rolled on his shoulder, and he passed away.\n\nThe lawyer said never a word, but his face was as sharp as a pen and as white as the dead man\u2019s; the servant broke out into a great noise of crying and weeping, like a child; and I, on my side, stood staring at them in a kind of horror. The sheriff\u2019s officer had run back at the first sound of the shot, to hasten the coming of the soldiers.\n\nAt last the lawyer laid down the dead man in his blood upon the road, and got to his own feet with a kind of stagger.\n\nI believe it was his movement that brought me to my senses; for he had no sooner done so than I began to scramble up the hill, crying out, \u201cThe murderer! the murderer!\u201d\n\nSo little a time had elapsed, that when I got to the top of the first steepness, and could see some part of the open mountain, the murderer was still moving away at no great distance. He was a big man, in a black coat, with metal buttons, and carried a long fowling-piece.\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d I cried. \u201cI see him!\u201d\n\nAt that the murderer gave a little, quick look over his shoulder, and began to run. The next moment he was lost in a fringe of birches; then he came out again on the upper side, where I could see him climbing like a jackanapes, for that part was again very steep; and then he dipped behind a shoulder, and I saw him no more.\n\nAll this time I had been running on my side, and had got a good way up, when a voice cried upon me to stand.\n\nI was at the edge of the upper wood, and so now, when I halted and looked back, I saw all the open part of the hill below me.\n\nThe lawyer and the sheriff\u2019s officer were standing just above the road, crying and waving on me to come back; and on their left, the red-coats, musket in hand, were beginning to struggle singly out of the lower wood.\n\n\u201cWhy should I come back?\u201d I cried. \u201cCome you on!\u201d\n\n\u201cTen pounds if ye take that lad!\u201d cried the lawyer. \u201cHe\u2019s an accomplice. He was posted here to hold us in talk.\u201d\n\nAt that word (which I could hear quite plainly, though it was to the soldiers and not to me that he was crying it) my heart came in my mouth with quite a new kind of terror. Indeed, it is one thing to stand the danger of your life, and quite another to run the peril of both life and character. The thing, besides, had come so suddenly, like thunder out of a clear sky, that I was all amazed and helpless.\n\nThe soldiers began to spread, some of them to run, and others to put up their pieces and cover me; and still I stood.\n\n\u201cJouk in here among the trees,\u201d said a voice close by.\n\nIndeed, I scarce knew what I was doing, but I obeyed; and as I did so, I heard the firelocks bang and the balls whistle in the birches.",
    "Sometimes we walked, sometimes ran; and as it drew on to morning, walked ever the less and ran the more. Though, upon its face, that country appeared to be a desert, yet there were huts and houses of the people, of which we must have passed more than twenty, hidden in quiet places of the hills. When we came to one of these, Alan would leave me in the way, and go himself and rap upon the side of the house and speak awhile at the window with some sleeper awakened. This was to pass the news; which, in that country, was so much of a duty that Alan must pause to attend to it even while fleeing for his life; and so well attended to by others, that in more than half of the houses where we called they had heard already of the murder. In the others, as well as I could make out (standing back at a distance and hearing a strange tongue), the news was received with more of consternation than surprise.\n\nFor all our hurry, day began to come in while we were still far from any shelter. It found us in a prodigious valley, strewn with rocks and where ran a foaming river. Wild mountains stood around it; there grew there neither grass nor trees; and I have sometimes thought since then, that it may have been the valley called Glencoe, where the massacre was in the time of King William. But for the details of our itinerary, I am all to seek; our way lying now by short cuts, now by great detours; our pace being so hurried, our time of journeying usually by night; and the names of such places as I asked and heard being in the Gaelic tongue and the more easily forgotten.\n\nThe first peep of morning, then, showed us this horrible place, and I could see Alan knit his brow.\n\n\u201cThis is no fit place for you and me,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a place they\u2019re bound to watch.\u201d\n\nAnd with that he ran harder than ever down to the water-side, in a part where the river was split in two among three rocks. It went through with a horrid thundering that made my belly quake; and there hung over the lynn a little mist of spray. Alan looked neither to the right nor to the left, but jumped clean upon the middle rock and fell there on his hands and knees to check himself, for that rock was small and he might have pitched over on the far side. I had scarce time to measure the distance or to understand the peril before I had followed him, and he had caught and stopped me.\n\nSo there we stood, side by side upon a small rock slippery with spray, a far broader leap in front of us, and the river dinning upon all sides. When I saw where I was, there came on me a deadly sickness of fear, and I put my hand over my eyes. Alan took me and shook me; I saw he was speaking, but the roaring of the falls and the trouble of my mind prevented me from hearing; only I saw his face was red with anger, and that he stamped upon the rock. The same look showed me the water raging by, and the mist hanging in the air: and with that I covered my eyes again and shuddered.\n\nThe next minute Alan had set the brandy bottle to my lips, and forced me to drink about a gill, which sent the blood into my head again. Then, putting his hands to his mouth, and his mouth to my ear, he shouted, \u201cHang or drown!\u201d and turning his back upon me, leaped over the farther branch of the stream, and landed safe.\n\nI was now alone upon the rock, which gave me the more room; the brandy was singing in my ears; I had this good example fresh before me, and just wit enough to see that if I did not leap at once, I should never leap at all. I bent low on my knees and flung myself forth, with that kind of anger of despair that has sometimes stood me in stead of courage. Sure enough, it was but my hands that reached the full length; these slipped, caught again, slipped again; and I was sliddering back into the lynn, when Alan seized me, first by the hair, then by the collar, and with a great strain dragged me into safety.\n\nNever a word he said, but set off running again for his life, and I must stagger to my feet and run after him. I had been weary before, but now I was sick and bruised, and partly drunken with the brandy; I kept stumbling as I ran, I had a stitch that came near to overmaster me; and when at last Alan paused under a great rock that stood there among a number of others, it was none too soon for David Balfour.\n\nA great rock I have said; but by rights it was two rocks leaning together at the top, both some twenty feet high, and at the first sight inaccessible. Even Alan (though you may say he had as good as four hands) failed twice in an attempt to climb them; and it was only at the third trial, and then by standing on my shoulders and leaping up with such force as I thought must have broken my collar-bone, that he secured a lodgment. Once there, he let down his leathern girdle; and with the aid of that and a pair of shallow footholds in the rock, I scrambled up beside him.\n\nThen I saw why we had come there; for the two rocks, being both somewhat hollow on the top and sloping one to the other, made a kind of dish or saucer, where as many as three or four men might have lain hidden.\n\nAll this while Alan had not said a word, and had run and climbed with such a savage, silent frenzy of hurry, that I knew that he was in mortal fear of some miscarriage. Even now we were on the rock he said nothing, nor so much as relaxed the frowning look upon his face; but clapped flat down, and keeping only one eye above the edge of our place of shelter scouted all round the compass. The dawn had come quite clear; we could see the stony sides of the valley, and its bottom, which was bestrewed with rocks, and the river, which went from one side to another, and made white falls; but nowhere the smoke of a house, nor any living creature but some eagles screaming round a cliff.\n\nThen at last Alan smiled.\n\n\u201cAy,\u201d said he, \u201cnow we have a chance;\u201d and then looking at me with some amusement, \u201cYe\u2019re no very gleg at the jumping,\u201d said he.\n\nAt this I suppose I coloured with mortification, for he added at once, \u201cHoots! small blame to ye! To be feared of a thing and yet to do it, is what makes the prettiest kind of a man. And then there was water there, and water\u2019s a thing that dauntons even me. No, no,\u201d said Alan, \u201cit\u2019s no you that\u2019s to blame, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nI asked him why.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said he, \u201cI have proved myself a gomeral this night. For first of all I take a wrong road, and that in my own country of Appin; so that the day has caught us where we should never have been; and thanks to that, we lie here in some danger and mair discomfort. And next (which is the worst of the two, for a man that has been so much among the heather as myself) I have come wanting a water-bottle, and here we lie for a long summer\u2019s day with naething but neat spirit. Ye may think that a small matter; but before it comes night, David, ye\u2019ll give me news of it.\u201d",
    "We came at last to the foot of an exceeding steep wood, which scrambled up a craggy hillside, and was crowned by a naked precipice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d said one of the guides, and we struck up hill.\n\nThe trees clung upon the slope, like sailors on the shrouds of a ship, and their trunks were like the rounds of a ladder, by which we mounted.\n\nQuite at the top, and just before the rocky face of the cliff sprang above the foliage, we found that strange house which was known in the country as \u201cCluny\u2019s Cage.\u201d The trunks of several trees had been wattled across, the intervals strengthened with stakes, and the ground behind this barricade levelled up with earth to make the floor. A tree, which grew out from the hillside, was the living centre-beam of the roof. The walls were of wattle and covered with moss. The whole house had something of an egg shape; and it half hung, half stood in that steep, hillside thicket, like a wasp\u2019s nest in a green hawthorn.\n\nWithin, it was large enough to shelter five or six persons with some comfort. A projection of the cliff had been cunningly employed to be the fireplace; and the smoke rising against the face of the rock, and being not dissimilar in colour, readily escaped notice from below.\n\nThis was but one of Cluny\u2019s hiding-places; he had caves, besides, and underground chambers in several parts of his country; and following the reports of his scouts, he moved from one to another as the soldiers drew near or moved away. By this manner of living, and thanks to the affection of his clan, he had not only stayed all this time in safety, while so many others had fled or been taken and slain: but stayed four or five years longer, and only went to France at last by the express command of his master. There he soon died; and it is strange to reflect that he may have regretted his Cage upon Ben Alder.\n\nWhen we came to the door he was seated by his rock chimney, watching a gillie about some cookery. He was mighty plainly habited, with a knitted nightcap drawn over his ears, and smoked a foul cutty pipe. For all that he had the manners of a king, and it was quite a sight to see him rise out of his place to welcome us.\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. Stewart, come awa\u2019, sir!\u201d said he, \u201cand bring in your friend that as yet I dinna ken the name of.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how is yourself, Cluny?\u201d said Alan. \u201cI hope ye do brawly, sir. And I am proud to see ye, and to present to ye my friend the Laird of Shaws, Mr. David Balfour.\u201d\n\nAlan never referred to my estate without a touch of a sneer, when we were alone; but with strangers, he rang the words out like a herald.\n\n\u201cStep in by, the both of ye, gentlemen,\u201d says Cluny. \u201cI make ye welcome to my house, which is a queer, rude place for certain, but one where I have entertained a royal personage, Mr. Stewart--ye doubtless ken the personage I have in my eye. We\u2019ll take a dram for luck, and as soon as this handless man of mine has the collops ready, we\u2019ll dine and take a hand at the cartes as gentlemen should. My life is a bit driegh,\u201d says he, pouring out the brandy; \u201cI see little company, and sit and twirl my thumbs, and mind upon a great day that is gone by, and weary for another great day that we all hope will be upon the road. And so here\u2019s a toast to ye: The Restoration!\u201d\n\nThereupon we all touched glasses and drank. I am sure I wished no ill to King George; and if he had been there himself in proper person, it\u2019s like he would have done as I did. No sooner had I taken out the drain than I felt hugely better, and could look on and listen, still a little mistily perhaps, but no longer with the same groundless horror and distress of mind.\n\nIt was certainly a strange place, and we had a strange host. In his long hiding, Cluny had grown to have all manner of precise habits, like those of an old maid. He had a particular place, where no one else must sit; the Cage was arranged in a particular way, which none must disturb; cookery was one of his chief fancies, and even while he was greeting us in, he kept an eye to the collops.\n\nIt appears, he sometimes visited or received visits from his wife and one or two of his nearest friends, under the cover of night; but for the more part lived quite alone, and communicated only with his sentinels and the gillies that waited on him in the Cage. The first thing in the morning, one of them, who was a barber, came and shaved him, and gave him the news of the country, of which he was immoderately greedy. There was no end to his questions; he put them as earnestly as a child; and at some of the answers, laughed out of all bounds of reason, and would break out again laughing at the mere memory, hours after the barber was gone.\n\nTo be sure, there might have been a purpose in his questions; for though he was thus sequestered, and like the other landed gentlemen of Scotland, stripped by the late Act of Parliament of legal powers, he still exercised a patriarchal justice in his clan. Disputes were brought to him in his hiding-hole to be decided; and the men of his country, who would have snapped their fingers at the Court of Session, laid aside revenge and paid down money at the bare word of this forfeited and hunted outlaw. When he was angered, which was often enough, he gave his commands and breathed threats of punishment like any king; and his gillies trembled and crouched away from him like children before a hasty father. With each of them, as he entered, he ceremoniously shook hands, both parties touching their bonnets at the same time in a military manner. Altogether, I had a fair chance to see some of the inner workings of a Highland clan; and this with a proscribed, fugitive chief; his country conquered; the troops riding upon all sides in quest of him, sometimes within a mile of where he lay; and when the least of the ragged fellows whom he rated and threatened, could have made a fortune by betraying him.\n\nOn that first day, as soon as the collops were ready, Cluny gave them with his own hand a squeeze of a lemon (for he was well supplied with luxuries) and bade us draw in to our meal.\n\n\u201cThey,\u201d said he, meaning the collops, \u201care such as I gave his Royal Highness in this very house; bating the lemon juice, for at that time we were glad to get the meat and never fashed for kitchen. Indeed, there were mair dragoons than lemons in my country in the year forty-six.\u201d\n\nI do not know if the collops were truly very good, but my heart rose against the sight of them, and I could eat but little. All the while Cluny entertained us with stories of Prince Charlie\u2019s stay in the Cage, giving us the very words of the speakers, and rising from his place to show us where they stood. By these, I gathered the Prince was a gracious, spirited boy, like the son of a race of polite kings, but not so wise as Solomon. I gathered, too, that while he was in the Cage, he was often drunk; so the fault that has since, by all accounts, made such a wreck of him, had even then begun to show itself.",
    "The third night we were to pass through the western end of the country of Balquhidder. It came clear and cold, with a touch in the air like frost, and a northerly wind that blew the clouds away and made the stars bright. The streams were full, of course, and still made a great noise among the hills; but I observed that Alan thought no more upon the Kelpie, and was in high good spirits. As for me, the change of weather came too late; I had lain in the mire so long that (as the Bible has it) my very clothes \u201cabhorred me.\u201d I was dead weary, deadly sick and full of pains and shiverings; the chill of the wind went through me, and the sound of it confused my ears. In this poor state I had to bear from my companion something in the nature of a persecution. He spoke a good deal, and never without a taunt. \u201cWhig\u201d was the best name he had to give me. \u201cHere,\u201d he would say, \u201chere\u2019s a dub for ye to jump, my Whiggie! I ken you\u2019re a fine jumper!\u201d And so on; all the time with a gibing voice and face.\n\nI knew it was my own doing, and no one else\u2019s; but I was too miserable to repent. I felt I could drag myself but little farther; pretty soon, I must lie down and die on these wet mountains like a sheep or a fox, and my bones must whiten there like the bones of a beast. My head was light perhaps; but I began to love the prospect, I began to glory in the thought of such a death, alone in the desert, with the wild eagles besieging my last moments. Alan would repent then, I thought; he would remember, when I was dead, how much he owed me, and the remembrance would be torture. So I went like a sick, silly, and bad-hearted schoolboy, feeding my anger against a fellow-man, when I would have been better on my knees, crying on God for mercy. And at each of Alan\u2019s taunts, I hugged myself. \u201cAh!\u201d thinks I to myself, \u201cI have a better taunt in readiness; when I lie down and die, you will feel it like a buffet in your face; ah, what a revenge! ah, how you will regret your ingratitude and cruelty!\u201d\n\nAll the while, I was growing worse and worse. Once I had fallen, my leg simply doubling under me, and this had struck Alan for the moment; but I was afoot so briskly, and set off again with such a natural manner, that he soon forgot the incident. Flushes of heat went over me, and then spasms of shuddering. The stitch in my side was hardly bearable. At last I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther: and with that, there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with Alan, let my anger blaze, and be done with my life in a more sudden manner. He had just called me \u201cWhig.\u201d I stopped.\n\n\u201cMr. Stewart,\u201d said I, in a voice that quivered like a fiddle-string, \u201cyou are older than I am, and should know your manners. Do you think it either very wise or very witty to cast my politics in my teeth? I thought, where folk differed, it was the part of gentlemen to differ civilly; and if I did not, I may tell you I could find a better taunt than some of yours.\u201d\n\nAlan had stopped opposite to me, his hat cocked, his hands in his breeches pockets, his head a little on one side. He listened, smiling evilly, as I could see by the starlight; and when I had done he began to whistle a Jacobite air. It was the air made in mockery of General Cope\u2019s defeat at Preston Pans:\n\n     \u201cHey, Johnnie Cope, are ye waukin\u2019 yet?\n     And are your drums a-beatin\u2019 yet?\u201d\n\nAnd it came in my mind that Alan, on the day of that battle, had been engaged upon the royal side.\n\n\u201cWhy do ye take that air, Mr. Stewart?\u201d said I. \u201cIs that to remind me you have been beaten on both sides?\u201d\n\nThe air stopped on Alan\u2019s lips. \u201cDavid!\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s time these manners ceased,\u201d I continued; \u201cand I mean you shall henceforth speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a Stewart--\u201d began Alan.\n\n\u201cO!\u201d says I, \u201cI ken ye bear a king\u2019s name. But you are to remember, since I have been in the Highlands, I have seen a good many of those that bear it; and the best I can say of them is this, that they would be none the worse of washing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know that you insult me?\u201d said Alan, very low.\n\n\u201cI am sorry for that,\u201d said I, \u201cfor I am not done; and if you distaste the sermon, I doubt the pirliecue will please you as little. You have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy. Both the Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you; you have run before them like a hare. It behoves you to speak of them as of your betters.\u201d\n\nAlan stood quite still, the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him in the wind.\n\n\u201cThis is a pity,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThere are things said that cannot be passed over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never asked you to,\u201d said I. \u201cI am as ready as yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cReady,\u201d I repeated. \u201cI am no blower and boaster like some that I could name. Come on!\u201d And drawing my sword, I fell on guard as Alan himself had taught me.\n\n\u201cDavid!\u201d he cried. \u201cAre ye daft? I cannae draw upon ye, David. It\u2019s fair murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was your look-out when you insulted me,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth!\u201d cried Alan, and he stood for a moment, wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity. \u201cIt\u2019s the bare truth,\u201d he said, and drew his sword. But before I could touch his blade with mine, he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground. \u201cNa, na,\u201d he kept saying, \u201cna, na--I cannae, I cannae.\u201d\n\nAt this the last of my anger oozed all out of me; and I found myself only sick, and sorry, and blank, and wondering at myself. I would have given the world to take back what I had said; but a word once spoken, who can recapture it? I minded me of all Alan\u2019s kindness and courage in the past, how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days; and then recalled my own insults, and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend. At the same time, the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble, and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness. I thought I must have swooned where I stood.\n\nThis it was that gave me a thought. No apology could blot out what I had said; it was needless to think of one, none could cover the offence; but where an apology was vain, a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side. I put my pride away from me. \u201cAlan!\u201d I said; \u201cif ye cannae help me, I must just die here.\u201d\n\nHe started up sitting, and looked at me.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d said I. \u201cI\u2019m by with it. O, let me get into the bield of a house--I\u2019ll can die there easier.\u201d I had no need to pretend; whether I chose or not, I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone.\n\n\u201cCan ye walk?\u201d asked Alan.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said I, \u201cnot without help. This last hour my legs have been fainting under me; I\u2019ve a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron; I cannae breathe right. If I die, ye\u2019ll can forgive me, Alan? In my heart, I liked ye fine--even when I was the angriest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWheesht, wheesht!\u201d cried Alan. \u201cDinna say that! David man, ye ken--\u201d He shut his mouth upon a sob. \u201cLet me get my arm about ye,\u201d he continued; \u201cthat\u2019s the way! Now lean upon me hard. Gude kens where there\u2019s a house! We\u2019re in Balwhidder, too; there should be no want of houses, no, nor friends\u2019 houses here. Do ye gang easier so, Davie?\u201d\n\n\u201cAy,\u201d said I, \u201cI can be doing this way;\u201d and I pressed his arm with my hand.\n\nAgain he came near sobbing. \u201cDavie,\u201d said he, \u201cI\u2019m no a right man at all; I have neither sense nor kindness; I could nae remember ye were just a bairn, I couldnae see ye were dying on your feet; Davie, ye\u2019ll have to try and forgive me.\u201d\n\n\u201cO man, let\u2019s say no more about it!\u201d said I. \u201cWe\u2019re neither one of us to mend the other--that\u2019s the truth! We must just bear and forbear, man Alan. O, but my stitch is sore! Is there nae house?\u201d",
    "In Limekilns we entered a small change-house, which we only knew to be a public by the wand over the door, and bought some bread and cheese from a good-looking lass that was the servant. This we carried with us in a bundle, meaning to sit and eat it in a bush of wood on the sea-shore, that we saw some third part of a mile in front. As we went, I kept looking across the water and sighing to myself; and though I took no heed of it, Alan had fallen into a muse. At last he stopped in the way.\n\n\u201cDid ye take heed of the lass we bought this of?\u201d says he, tapping on the bread and cheese.\n\n\u201cTo be sure,\u201d said I, \u201cand a bonny lass she was.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe thought that?\u201d cries he. \u201cMan, David, that\u2019s good news.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the name of all that\u2019s wonderful, why so?\u201d says I. \u201cWhat good can that do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Alan, with one of his droll looks, \u201cI was rather in hopes it would maybe get us that boat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it were the other way about, it would be liker it,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all that you ken, ye see,\u201d said Alan. \u201cI don\u2019t want the lass to fall in love with ye, I want her to be sorry for ye, David; to which end there is no manner of need that she should take you for a beauty. Let me see (looking me curiously over). I wish ye were a wee thing paler; but apart from that ye\u2019ll do fine for my purpose--ye have a fine, hang-dog, rag-and-tatter, clappermaclaw kind of a look to ye, as if ye had stolen the coat from a potato-bogle. Come; right about, and back to the change-house for that boat of ours.\u201d\n\nI followed him, laughing.\n\n\u201cDavid Balfour,\u201d said he, \u201cye\u2019re a very funny gentleman by your way of it, and this is a very funny employ for ye, no doubt. For all that, if ye have any affection for my neck (to say nothing of your own) ye will perhaps be kind enough to take this matter responsibly. I am going to do a bit of play-acting, the bottom ground of which is just exactly as serious as the gallows for the pair of us. So bear it, if ye please, in mind, and conduct yourself according.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said I, \u201chave it as you will.\u201d\n\nAs we got near the clachan, he made me take his arm and hang upon it like one almost helpless with weariness; and by the time he pushed open the change-house door, he seemed to be half carrying me. The maid appeared surprised (as well she might be) at our speedy return; but Alan had no words to spare for her in explanation, helped me to a chair, called for a tass of brandy with which he fed me in little sips, and then breaking up the bread and cheese helped me to eat it like a nursery-lass; the whole with that grave, concerned, affectionate countenance, that might have imposed upon a judge. It was small wonder if the maid were taken with the picture we presented, of a poor, sick, overwrought lad and his most tender comrade. She drew quite near, and stood leaning with her back on the next table.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s like wrong with him?\u201d said she at last.\n\nAlan turned upon her, to my great wonder, with a kind of fury. \u201cWrong?\u201d cries he. \u201cHe\u2019s walked more hundreds of miles than he has hairs upon his chin, and slept oftener in wet heather than dry sheets. Wrong, quo\u2019 she! Wrong enough, I would think! Wrong, indeed!\u201d and he kept grumbling to himself as he fed me, like a man ill-pleased.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s young for the like of that,\u201d said the maid.\n\n\u201cOwer young,\u201d said Alan, with his back to her.\n\n\u201cHe would be better riding,\u201d says she.\n\n\u201cAnd where could I get a horse to him?\u201d cried Alan, turning on her with the same appearance of fury. \u201cWould ye have me steal?\u201d\n\nI thought this roughness would have sent her off in dudgeon, as indeed it closed her mouth for the time. But my companion knew very well what he was doing; and for as simple as he was in some things of life, had a great fund of roguishness in such affairs as these.\n\n\u201cYe neednae tell me,\u201d she said at last--\u201cye\u2019re gentry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Alan, softened a little (I believe against his will) by this artless comment, \u201cand suppose we were? Did ever you hear that gentrice put money in folk\u2019s pockets?\u201d\n\nShe sighed at this, as if she were herself some disinherited great lady. \u201cNo,\u201d says she, \u201cthat\u2019s true indeed.\u201d\n\nI was all this while chafing at the part I played, and sitting tongue-tied between shame and merriment; but somehow at this I could hold in no longer, and bade Alan let me be, for I was better already. My voice stuck in my throat, for I ever hated to take part in lies; but my very embarrassment helped on the plot, for the lass no doubt set down my husky voice to sickness and fatigue.\n\n\u201cHas he nae friends?\u201d said she, in a tearful voice.\n\n\u201cThat has he so!\u201d cried Alan, \u201cif we could but win to them!--friends and rich friends, beds to lie in, food to eat, doctors to see to him--and here he must tramp in the dubs and sleep in the heather like a beggarman.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why that?\u201d says the lass.\n\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Alan, \u201cI cannae very safely say; but I\u2019ll tell ye what I\u2019ll do instead,\u201d says he, \u201cI\u2019ll whistle ye a bit tune.\u201d And with that he leaned pretty far over the table, and in a mere breath of a whistle, but with a wonderful pretty sentiment, gave her a few bars of \u201cCharlie is my darling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWheesht,\u201d says she, and looked over her shoulder to the door.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said Alan.\n\n\u201cAnd him so young!\u201d cries the lass.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s old enough to----\u201d and Alan struck his forefinger on the back part of his neck, meaning that I was old enough to lose my head.\n\n\u201cIt would be a black shame,\u201d she cried, flushing high.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what will be, though,\u201d said Alan, \u201cunless we manage the better.\u201d\n\nAt this the lass turned and ran out of that part of the house, leaving us alone together. Alan in high good humour at the furthering of his schemes, and I in bitter dudgeon at being called a Jacobite and treated like a child.\n\n\u201cAlan,\u201d I cried, \u201cI can stand no more of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe\u2019ll have to sit it then, Davie,\u201d said he. \u201cFor if ye upset the pot now, ye may scrape your own life out of the fire, but Alan Breck is a dead man.\u201d\n\nThis was so true that I could only groan; and even my groan served Alan\u2019s purpose, for it was overheard by the lass as she came flying in again with a dish of white puddings and a bottle of strong ale.",
    "Having made what change I could in my appearance; and blithe was I to look in the glass and find the beggarman a thing of the past, and David Balfour come to life again. And yet I was ashamed of the change too, and, above all, of the borrowed clothes. When I had done, Mr. Rankeillor caught me on the stair, made me his compliments, and had me again into the cabinet.\n\n\u201cSit ye down, Mr. David,\u201d said he, \u201cand now that you are looking a little more like yourself, let me see if I can find you any news. You will be wondering, no doubt, about your father and your uncle? To be sure it is a singular tale; and the explanation is one that I blush to have to offer you. For,\u201d says he, really with embarrassment, \u201cthe matter hinges on a love affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruly,\u201d said I, \u201cI cannot very well join that notion with my uncle.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut your uncle, Mr. David, was not always old,\u201d replied the lawyer, \u201cand what may perhaps surprise you more, not always ugly. He had a fine, gallant air; people stood in their doors to look after him, as he went by upon a mettle horse. I have seen it with these eyes, and I ingenuously confess, not altogether without envy; for I was a plain lad myself and a plain man\u2019s son; and in those days it was a case of _Odi te, qui bellus es, Sabelle_.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like a dream,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cAy, ay,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cthat is how it is with youth and age. Nor was that all, but he had a spirit of his own that seemed to promise great things in the future. In 1715, what must he do but run away to join the rebels? It was your father that pursued him, found him in a ditch, and brought him back _multum gementem;_ to the mirth of the whole country. However, _majora canamus_--the two lads fell in love, and that with the same lady. Mr. Ebenezer, who was the admired and the beloved, and the spoiled one, made, no doubt, mighty certain of the victory; and when he found he had deceived himself, screamed like a peacock. The whole country heard of it; now he lay sick at home, with his silly family standing round the bed in tears; now he rode from public-house to public-house, and shouted his sorrows into the lug of Tom, Dick, and Harry. Your father, Mr. David, was a kind gentleman; but he was weak, dolefully weak; took all this folly with a long countenance; and one day--by your leave!--resigned the lady. She was no such fool, however; it\u2019s from her you must inherit your excellent good sense; and she refused to be bandied from one to another. Both got upon their knees to her; and the upshot of the matter for that while was that she showed both of them the door. That was in August; dear me! the same year I came from college. The scene must have been highly farcical.\u201d\n\nI thought myself it was a silly business, but I could not forget my father had a hand in it. \u201cSurely, sir, it had some note of tragedy,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cWhy, no, sir, not at all,\u201d returned the lawyer. \u201cFor tragedy implies some ponderable matter in dispute, some _dignus vindice nodus;_ and this piece of work was all about the petulance of a young ass that had been spoiled, and wanted nothing so much as to be tied up and soundly belted. However, that was not your father\u2019s view; and the end of it was, that from concession to concession on your father\u2019s part, and from one height to another of squalling, sentimental selfishness upon your uncle\u2019s, they came at last to drive a sort of bargain, from whose ill results you have recently been smarting. The one man took the lady, the other the estate. Now, Mr. David, they talk a great deal of charity and generosity; but in this disputable state of life, I often think the happiest consequences seem to flow when a gentleman consults his lawyer, and takes all the law allows him. Anyhow, this piece of Quixotry on your father\u2019s part, as it was unjust in itself, has brought forth a monstrous family of injustices. Your father and mother lived and died poor folk; you were poorly reared; and in the meanwhile, what a time it has been for the tenants on the estate of Shaws! And I might add (if it was a matter I cared much about) what a time for Mr. Ebenezer!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet that is certainly the strangest part of all,\u201d said I, \u201cthat a man\u2019s nature should thus change.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Mr. Rankeillor. \u201cAnd yet I imagine it was natural enough. He could not think that he had played a handsome part. Those who knew the story gave him the cold shoulder; those who knew it not, seeing one brother disappear, and the other succeed in the estate, raised a cry of murder; so that upon all sides he found himself evited. Money was all he got by his bargain; well, he came to think the more of money. He was selfish when he was young, he is selfish now that he is old; and the latter end of all these pretty manners and fine feelings you have seen for yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d said I, \u201cand in all this, what is my position?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe estate is yours beyond a doubt,\u201d replied the lawyer. \u201cIt matters nothing what your father signed, you are the heir of entail. But your uncle is a man to fight the indefensible; and it would be likely your identity that he would call in question. A lawsuit is always expensive, and a family lawsuit always scandalous; besides which, if any of your doings with your friend Mr. Thomson were to come out, we might find that we had burned our fingers. The kidnapping, to be sure, would be a court card upon our side, if we could only prove it. But it may be difficult to prove; and my advice (upon the whole) is to make a very easy bargain with your uncle, perhaps even leaving him at Shaws where he has taken root for a quarter of a century, and contenting yourself in the meanwhile with a fair provision.\u201d\n\nI told him I was very willing to be easy, and that to carry family concerns before the public was a step from which I was naturally much averse. In the meantime (thinking to myself) I began to see the outlines of that scheme on which we afterwards acted.\n\n\u201cThe great affair,\u201d I asked, \u201cis to bring home to him the kidnapping?\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely,\u201d said Mr. Rankeillor, \u201cand if possible, out of court. For mark you here, Mr. David: we could no doubt find some men of the _Covenant_ who would swear to your reclusion; but once they were in the box, we could no longer check their testimony, and some word of your friend Mr. Thomson must certainly crop out. Which (from what you have let fall) I cannot think to be desirable.\u201d"

  "Alexandre Dumas -- The Man in the Iron Mask": [
    "Since Aramis\u2019s singular transformation into a confessor of the order, Baisemeaux was no longer the same man. Up to that period, the place which Aramis had held in the worthy governor\u2019s estimation was that of a prelate whom he respected and a friend to whom he owed a debt of gratitude; but now he felt himself an inferior, and that Aramis was his master. He himself lighted a lantern, summoned a turnkey, and said, returning to Aramis, \u201cI am at your orders, monseigneur.\u201d Aramis merely nodded his head, as much as to say, \u201cVery good\u201d; and signed to him with his hand to lead the way. Baisemeaux advanced, and Aramis followed him. It was a calm and lovely starlit night; the steps of three men resounded on the flags of the terraces, and the clinking of the keys hanging from the jailer\u2019s girdle made itself heard up to the stories of the towers, as if to remind the prisoners that the liberty of earth was a luxury beyond their reach. It might have been said that the alteration effected in Baisemeaux extended even to the prisoners. The turnkey, the same who, on Aramis\u2019s first arrival had shown himself so inquisitive and curious, was now not only silent, but impassible. He held his head down, and seemed afraid to keep his ears open. In this wise they reached the basement of the Bertaudiere, the two first stories of which were mounted silently and somewhat slowly; for Baisemeaux, though far from disobeying, was far from exhibiting any eagerness to obey. On arriving at the door, Baisemeaux showed a disposition to enter the prisoner\u2019s chamber; but Aramis, stopping him on the threshold, said, \u201cThe rules do not allow the governor to hear the prisoner\u2019s confession.\u201d\n\nBaisemeaux bowed, and made way for Aramis, who took the lantern and entered; and then signed to them to close the door behind him. For an instant he remained standing, listening whether Baisemeaux and the turnkey had retired; but as soon as he was assured by the sound of their descending footsteps that they had left the tower, he put the lantern on the table and gazed around. On a bed of green serge, similar in all respect to the other beds in the Bastile, save that it was newer, and under curtains half-drawn, reposed a young man, to whom we have already once before introduced Aramis. According to custom, the prisoner was without a light. At the hour of curfew, he was bound to extinguish his lamp, and we perceive how much he was favored, in being allowed to keep it burning even till then. Near the bed a large leathern armchair, with twisted legs, sustained his clothes. A little table--without pens, books, paper, or ink--stood neglected in sadness near the window; while several plates, still unemptied, showed that the prisoner had scarcely touched his evening meal. Aramis saw that the young man was stretched upon his bed, his face half concealed by his arms. The arrival of a visitor did not caused any change of position; either he was waiting in expectation, or was asleep. Aramis lighted the candle from the lantern, pushed back the armchair, and approached the bed with an evident mixture of interest and respect. The young man raised his head. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cYou desired a confessor?\u201d replied Aramis.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you were ill?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery ill?\u201d\n\nThe young man gave Aramis a piercing glance, and answered, \u201cI thank you.\u201d After a moment\u2019s silence, \u201cI have seen you before,\u201d he continued. Aramis bowed.\n\nDoubtless the scrutiny the prisoner had just made of the cold, crafty, and imperious character stamped upon the features of the bishop of Vannes was little reassuring to one in his situation, for he added, \u201cI am better.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so?\u201d said Aramis.\n\n\u201cWhy, then--being better, I have no longer the same need of a confessor, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even of the hair-cloth, which the note you found in your bread informed you of?\u201d\n\nThe young man started; but before he had either assented or denied, Aramis continued, \u201cNot even of the ecclesiastic from whom you were to hear an important revelation?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it be so,\u201d said the young man, sinking again on his pillow, \u201cit is different; I am listening.\u201d\n\nAramis then looked at him more closely, and was struck with the easy majesty of his mien, one which can never be acquired unless Heaven has implanted it in the blood or heart. \u201cSit down, monsieur,\u201d said the prisoner.\n\nAramis bowed and obeyed. \u201cHow does the Bastile agree with you?\u201d asked the bishop.\n\n\u201cVery well.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not suffer?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have nothing to regret?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even your liberty?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you call liberty, monsieur?\u201d asked the prisoner, with the tone of a man who is preparing for a struggle.\n\n\u201cI call liberty, the flowers, the air, light, the stars, the happiness of going whithersoever the sinewy limbs of one-and-twenty chance to wish to carry you.\u201d\n\nThe young man smiled, whether in resignation or contempt, it was difficult to tell. \u201cLook,\u201d said he, \u201cI have in that Japanese vase two roses gathered yesterday evening in the bud from the governor\u2019s garden; this morning they have blown and spread their vermilion chalice beneath my gaze; with every opening petal they unfold the treasures of their perfumes, filling my chamber with a fragrance that embalms it. Look now on these two roses; even among roses these are beautiful, and the rose is the most beautiful of flowers. Why, then, do you bid me desire other flowers when I possess the loveliest of all?\u201d\n\nAramis gazed at the young man in surprise.\n\n\u201cIf _flowers_ constitute liberty,\u201d sadly resumed the captive, \u201cI am free, for I possess them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the air!\u201d cried Aramis; \u201cair is so necessary to life!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, monsieur,\u201d returned the prisoner; \u201cdraw near to the window; it is open. Between high heaven and earth the wind whirls on its waftages of hail and lightning, exhales its torrid mist or breathes in gentle breezes. It caresses my face. When mounted on the back of this armchair, with my arm around the bars of the window to sustain myself, I fancy I am swimming the wide expanse before me.\u201d The countenance of Aramis darkened as the young man continued: \u201cLight I have! what is better than light? I have the sun, a friend who comes to visit me every day without the permission of the governor or the jailer\u2019s company. He comes in at the window, and traces in my room a square the shape of the window, which lights up the hangings of my bed and floods the very floor. This luminous square increases from ten o\u2019clock till midday, and decreases from one till three slowly, as if, having hastened to my presence, it sorrowed at bidding me farewell. When its last ray disappears I have enjoyed its presence for five hours. Is not that sufficient? I have been told that there are unhappy beings who dig in quarries, and laborers who toil in mines, who never behold it at all.\u201d Aramis wiped the drops from his brow. \u201cAs to the stars which are so delightful to view,\u201d continued the young man, \u201cthey all resemble each other save in size and brilliancy. I am a favored mortal, for if you had not lighted that candle you would have been able to see the beautiful stars which I was gazing at from my couch before your arrival, whose silvery rays were stealing through my brain.\u201d",
    "Since the departure of Athos for Blois, Porthos and D\u2019Artagnan were seldom together. One was occupied with harassing duties for the king, the other had been making many purchases of furniture which he intended to forward to his estate, and by aid of which he hoped to establish in his various residences something of the courtly luxury he had witnessed in all its dazzling brightness in his majesty\u2019s society. D\u2019Artagnan, ever faithful, one morning during an interval of service thought about Porthos, and being uneasy at not having heard anything of him for a fortnight, directed his steps towards his hotel, and pounced upon him just as he was getting up. The worthy baron had a pensive--nay, more than pensive--melancholy air. He was sitting on his bed, only half-dressed, and with legs dangling over the edge, contemplating a host of garments, which with their fringes, lace, embroidery, and slashes of ill-assorted hues, were strewed all over the floor. Porthos, sad and reflective as La Fontaine\u2019s hare, did not observe D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s entrance, which was, moreover, screened at this moment by M. Mouston, whose personal corpulency, quite enough at any time to hide one man from another, was effectually doubled by a scarlet coat which the intendant was holding up for his master\u2019s inspection, by the sleeves, that he might the better see it all over. D\u2019Artagnan stopped at the threshold and looked in at the pensive Porthos and then, as the sight of the innumerable garments strewing the floor caused mighty sighs to heave the bosom of that excellent gentleman, D\u2019Artagnan thought it time to put an end to these dismal reflections, and coughed by way of announcing himself.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d exclaimed Porthos, whose countenance brightened with joy; \u201cah! ah! Here is D\u2019Artagnan. I shall then get hold of an idea!\u201d\n\nAt these words Mouston, doubting what was going on behind him, got out of the way, smiling kindly at the friend of his master, who thus found himself freed from the material obstacle which had prevented his reaching D\u2019Artagnan. Porthos made his sturdy knees crack again in rising, and crossing the room in two strides, found himself face to face with his friend, whom he folded to his breast with a force of affection that seemed to increase with every day. \u201cAh!\u201d he repeated, \u201cyou are always welcome, dear friend; but just now you are more welcome than ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you seem to have the megrims here!\u201d exclaimed D\u2019Artagnan.\n\nPorthos replied by a look expressive of dejection. \u201cWell, then, tell me all about it, Porthos, my friend, unless it is a secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the first place,\u201d returned Porthos, \u201cyou know I have no secrets from you. This, then, is what saddens me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute, Porthos; let me first get rid of all this litter of satin and velvet!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, never mind,\u201d said Porthos, contemptuously; \u201cit is all trash.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrash, Porthos! Cloth at twenty-five livres an ell! gorgeous satin! regal velvet!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you think these clothes are--\u201d\n\n\u201cSplendid, Porthos, splendid! I\u2019ll wager that you alone in France have so many; and suppose you never had any more made, and were to live to be a hundred years of age, which wouldn\u2019t astonish me in the very least, you could still wear a new dress the day of your death, without being obliged to see the nose of a single tailor from now till then.\u201d\n\nPorthos shook his head.\n\n\u201cCome, my friend,\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthis unnatural melancholy in you frightens me. My dear Porthos, pray get it out, then. And the sooner the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my friend, so I will: if, indeed, it is possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you have received bad news from Bracieux?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo: they have felled the wood, and it has yielded a third more than the estimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen there has been a falling-off in the pools of Pierrefonds?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, my friend: they have been fished, and there is enough left to stock all the pools in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps your estate at Vallon has been destroyed by an earthquake?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, my friend; on the contrary, the ground was struck with lightning a hundred paces from the chateau, and a fountain sprung up in a place entirely destitute of water.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in the world _is_ the matter, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is, I have received an invitation for the _fete_ at Vaux,\u201d said Porthos, with a lugubrious expression.\n\n\u201cWell! do you complain of that? The king has caused a hundred mortal heart-burnings among the courtiers by refusing invitations. And so, my dear friend, you are really going to Vaux?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed I am!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will see a magnificent sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlas! I doubt it, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything that is grand in France will be brought together there!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d cried Porthos, tearing out a lock of hair in his despair.\n\n\u201cEh! good heavens, are you ill?\u201d cried D\u2019Artagnan.\n\n\u201cI am as firm as the Pont-Neuf! It isn\u2019t that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what is it, then?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Tis that I have no clothes!\u201d\n\nD\u2019Artagnan stood petrified. \u201cNo clothes! Porthos, no clothes!\u201d he cried, \u201cwhen I see at least fifty suits on the floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty, truly; but not one which fits me!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? not one that fits you? But are you not measured, then, when you give an order?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be sure he is,\u201d answered Mouston; \u201cbut unfortunately _I_ have gotten stouter!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! _you_ stouter!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo much so that I am now bigger than the baron. Would you believe it, monsieur?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Parbleu!_ it seems to me that is quite evident.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you see, stupid?\u201d said Porthos, \u201cthat is quite evident!\u201d\n\n\u201cBe still, my dear Porthos,\u201d resumed D\u2019Artagnan, becoming slightly impatient, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why your clothes should not fit you, because Mouston has grown stouter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going to explain it,\u201d said Porthos. \u201cYou remember having related to me the story of the Roman general Antony, who had always seven wild boars kept roasting, each cooked up to a different point; so that he might be able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask for it. Well, then, I resolved, as at any time I might be invited to court to spend a week, I resolved to have always seven suits ready for the occasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cCapitally reasoned, Porthos--only a man must have a fortune like yours to gratify such whims. Without counting the time lost in being measured, the fashions are always changing.\u201d",
    "Aramis was the first to descend from the carriage; he held the door open for the young man. He saw him place his foot on the mossy ground with a trembling of the whole body, and walk round the carriage with an unsteady and almost tottering step. It seemed as if the poor prisoner was unaccustomed to walk on God\u2019s earth. It was the 15th of August, about eleven o\u2019clock at night; thick clouds, portending a tempest, overspread the heavens, and shrouded every light and prospect underneath their heavy folds. The extremities of the avenues were imperceptibly detached from the copse, by a lighter shadow of opaque gray, which, upon closer examination, became visible in the midst of the obscurity. But the fragrance which ascended from the grass, fresher and more penetrating than that which exhaled from the trees around him; the warm and balmy air which enveloped him for the first time for many years past; the ineffable enjoyment of liberty in an open country, spoke to the prince in so seductive a language, that notwithstanding the preternatural caution, we would almost say dissimulation of his character, of which we have tried to give an idea, he could not restrain his emotion, and breathed a sigh of ecstasy. Then, by degrees, he raised his aching head and inhaled the softly scented air, as it was wafted in gentle gusts to his uplifted face. Crossing his arms on his chest, as if to control this new sensation of delight, he drank in delicious draughts of that mysterious air which interpenetrates at night the loftiest forests. The sky he was contemplating, the murmuring waters, the universal freshness--was not all this reality? Was not Aramis a madman to suppose that he had aught else to dream of in this world? Those exciting pictures of country life, so free from fears and troubles, the ocean of happy days that glitters incessantly before all young imaginations, are real allurements wherewith to fascinate a poor, unhappy prisoner, worn out by prison cares, emaciated by the stifling air of the Bastile. It was the picture, it will be remembered, drawn by Aramis, when he offered the thousand pistoles he had with him in the carriage to the prince, and the enchanted Eden which the deserts of Bas-Poitou hid from the eyes of the world. Such were the reflections of Aramis as he watched, with an anxiety impossible to describe, the silent progress of the emotions of Philippe, whom he perceived gradually becoming more and more absorbed in his meditations. The young prince was offering up an inward prayer to Heaven, to be divinely guided in this trying moment, upon which his life or death depended. It was an anxious time for the bishop of Vannes, who had never before been so perplexed. His iron will, accustomed to overcome all obstacles, never finding itself inferior or vanquished on any occasion, to be foiled in so vast a project from not having foreseen the influence which a view of nature in all its luxuriance would have on the human mind! Aramis, overwhelmed by anxiety, contemplated with emotion the painful struggle that was taking place in Philippe\u2019s mind. This suspense lasted the whole ten minutes which the young man had requested. During this space of time, which appeared an eternity, Philippe continued gazing with an imploring and sorrowful look towards the heavens; Aramis did not remove the piercing glance he had fixed on Philippe. Suddenly the young man bowed his head. His thought returned to the earth, his looks perceptibly hardened, his brow contracted, his mouth assuming an expression of undaunted courage; again his looks became fixed, but this time they wore a worldly expression, hardened by covetousness, pride, and strong desire. Aramis\u2019s look immediately became as soft as it had before been gloomy. Philippe, seizing his hand in a quick, agitated manner, exclaimed:\n\n\u201cLead me to where the crown of France is to be found.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this your decision, monseigneur?\u201d asked Aramis.\n\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIrrevocably so?\u201d\n\nPhilippe did not even deign to reply. He gazed earnestly at the bishop, as if to ask him if it were possible for a man to waver after having once made up his mind.\n\n\u201cSuch looks are flashes of the hidden fire that betrays men\u2019s character,\u201d said Aramis, bowing over Philippe\u2019s hand; \u201cyou will be great, monseigneur, I will answer for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us resume our conversation. I wished to discuss two points with you; in the first place the dangers, or the obstacles we may meet with. That point is decided. The other is the conditions you intend imposing on me. It is your turn to speak, M. d\u2019Herblay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conditions, monseigneur?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoubtless. You will not allow so mere a trifle to stop me, and you will not do me the injustice to suppose that I think you have no interest in this affair. Therefore, without subterfuge or hesitation, tell me the truth--\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do so, monseigneur. Once a king--\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen will that be?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo-morrow evening--I mean in the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cExplain yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I shall have asked your highness a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sent to your highness a man in my confidence with instructions to deliver some closely written notes, carefully drawn up, which will thoroughly acquaint your highness with the different persons who compose and will compose your court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI perused those notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttentively?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know them by heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd understand them? Pardon me, but I may venture to ask that question of a poor, abandoned captive of the Bastile? In a week\u2019s time it will not be requisite to further question a mind like yours. You will then be in full possession of liberty and power.\u201d\n\n\u201cInterrogate me, then, and I will be a scholar representing his lesson to his master.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will begin with your family, monseigneur.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother, Anne of Austria! all her sorrows, her painful malady. Oh! I know her--I know her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour second brother?\u201d asked Aramis, bowing.\n\n\u201cTo these notes,\u201d replied the prince, \u201cyou have added portraits so faithfully painted, that I am able to recognize the persons whose characters, manners, and history you have so carefully portrayed. Monsieur, my brother, is a fine, dark young man, with a pale face; he does not love his wife, Henrietta, whom I, Louis XIV., loved a little, and still flirt with, even although she made me weep on the day she wished to dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valliere from her service in disgrace.\u201d",
    "\u201cM. d\u2019Artagnan entertains a great many suspicions, it seems,\u201d he said. \u201cAh!--you recognized M. d\u2019Artagnan, then?\u201d \u201cBefore you called him by his name, even.\u201d \u201cHe is your captain of musketeers.\u201d \u201cHe is very devoted to _me_,\u201d replied Philippe, laying a stress upon the personal pronoun. \u201cAs faithful as a dog; but he bites sometimes. If D\u2019Artagnan does not recognize you before _the other_ has disappeared, rely upon D\u2019Artagnan to the end of the world; for in that case, if he has seen nothing, he will keep his fidelity. If he sees, when it is too late, he is a Gascon, and will never admit that he has been deceived.\u201d \u201cI thought so. What are we to do, now?\u201d \u201cSit in this folding-chair. I am going to push aside a portion of the flooring; you will look through the opening, which answers to one of the false windows made in the dome of the king\u2019s apartment. Can you see?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Philippe, starting as at the sight of an enemy; \u201cI see the king!\u201d \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d \u201cHe seems to wish some man to sit down close to him.\u201d \u201cM. Fouquet?\u201d \u201cNo, no; wait a moment--\u201d \u201cLook at the notes and the portraits, my prince.\u201d \u201cThe man whom the king wishes to sit down in his presence is M. Colbert.\u201d \u201cColbert sit down in the king\u2019s presence!\u201d exclaimed Aramis. \u201cIt is impossible.\u201d \u201cLook.\u201d Aramis looked through the opening in the flooring. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cColbert himself. Oh, monseigneur! what can we be going to hear--and what can result from this intimacy?\u201d \u201cNothing good for M. Fouquet, at all events.\u201d The prince did not deceive himself. We have seen that Louis XIV. had sent for Colbert, and Colbert had arrived. The conversation began between them by the king according to him one of the highest favors that he had ever done; it was true the king was alone with his subject. \u201cColbert,\u201d said he, \u201csit down.\u201d The intendant, overcome with delight, for he feared he was about to be dismissed, refused this unprecedented honor. \u201cDoes he accept?\u201d said Aramis. \u201cNo, he remains standing.\u201d \u201cLet us listen, then.\u201d And the future king and the future pope listened eagerly to the simple mortals they held under their feet, ready to crush them when they liked. \u201cColbert,\u201d said the king, \u201cyou have annoyed me exceedingly to-day.\u201d \u201cI know it, sire.\u201d \u201cVery good; I like that answer. Yes, you knew it, and there was courage in the doing of it.\u201d \u201cI ran the risk of displeasing your majesty, but I risked, also, the concealment of your best interests.\u201d \u201cWhat! you were afraid of something on _my_ account?\u201d \u201cI was, sire, even if it were nothing more than an indigestion,\u201d said Colbert; \u201cfor people do not give their sovereigns such banquets as the one of to-day, unless it be to stifle them beneath the burden of good living.\u201d Colbert awaited the effect this coarse jest would produce upon the king; and Louis XIV., who was the vainest and the most fastidiously delicate man in his kingdom, forgave Colbert the joke. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d he said, \u201cthat M. Fouquet has given me too good a meal. Tell me, Colbert, where does he get all the money required for this enormous expenditure,--can you tell?\u201d \u201cYes, I do know, sire.\u201d \u201cWill you be able to prove it with tolerable certainty?\u201d \u201cEasily; and to the utmost farthing.\u201d \u201cI know you are very exact.\u201d \u201cExactitude is the principal qualification required in an intendant of finances.\u201d \u201cBut all are not so.\u201d \u201cI thank you majesty for so flattering a compliment from your own lips.\u201d \u201cM. Fouquet, therefore, is rich--very rich, and I suppose every man knows he is so.\u201d \u201cEvery one, sire; the living as well as the dead.\u201d \u201cWhat does that mean, Monsieur Colbert?\u201d \u201cThe living are witnesses of M. Fouquet\u2019s wealth,--they admire and applaud the result produced; but the dead, wiser and better informed than we are, know how that wealth was obtained--and they rise up in accusation.\u201d \u201cSo that M. Fouquet owes his wealth to some cause or other.\u201d \u201cThe occupation of an intendant very often favors those who practice it.\u201d \u201cYou have something to say to me more confidentially, I perceive; do not be afraid, we are quite alone.\u201d \u201cI am never afraid of anything under the shelter of my own conscience, and under the protection of your majesty,\u201d said Colbert, bowing. \u201cIf the dead, therefore, were to speak--\u201d \u201cThey do speak sometimes, sire,--read.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d murmured Aramis, in the prince\u2019s ear, who, close beside him, listened without losing a syllable, \u201csince you are placed here, monseigneur, in order to learn your vocation of a king, listen to a piece of infamy--of a nature truly royal. You are about to be a witness of one of those scenes which the foul fiend alone conceives and executes. Listen attentively,--you will find your advantage in it.\u201d The prince redoubled his attention, and saw Louis XIV. take from Colbert\u2019s hands a letter the latter held out to him. \u201cThe late cardinal\u2019s handwriting,\u201d said the king. \u201cYour majesty has an excellent memory,\u201d replied Colbert, bowing; \u201cit is an immense advantage for a king who is destined for hard work to recognize handwritings at the first glance.\u201d The king read Mazarin\u2019s letter, and, as its contents are already known to the reader, in consequence of the misunderstanding between Madame de Chevreuse and Aramis, nothing further would be learned if we stated them here again. \u201cI do not quite understand,\u201d said the king, greatly interested. \u201cYour majesty has not acquired the utilitarian habit of checking the public accounts.\u201d \u201cI see that it refers to money that had been given to M. Fouquet.\u201d \u201cThirteen millions. A tolerably good sum.\u201d \u201cYes. Well, these thirteen millions are wanting to balance the total of the account. That is what I do not very well understand. How was this deficit possible?\u201d \u201cPossible I do not say; but there is no doubt about fact that it is really so.\u201d \u201cYou say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the accounts?\u201d \u201cI do not say so, but the registry does.\u201d \u201cAnd this letter of M. Mazarin indicates the employment of that sum and the name of the person with whom it was deposited?\u201d \u201cAs your majesty can judge for yourself.\u201d \u201cYes; and the result is, then, that M. Fouquet has not yet restored the thirteen millions.\u201d \u201cThat results from the accounts, certainly, sire.\u201d \u201cWell, and, consequently--\u201d \u201cWell, sire, in that case, inasmuch as M. Fouquet has not yet given back the thirteen millions, he must have appropriated them to his own purpose; and with those thirteen millions one could incur four times and a little more as much expense, and make four times as great a display, as your majesty was able to do at Fontainebleau, where we only spent three millions altogether, if you remember.\u201d For a blunderer, the _souvenir_ he had evoked was a rather skillfully contrived piece of baseness; for by the remembrance of his own _fete_ he, for the first time, perceived its inferiority compared with that of Fouquet. Colbert received back again at Vaux what Fouquet had given him at Fontainebleau, and, as a good financier, returned it with the best possible interest. Having once disposed the king\u2019s mind in this artful way, Colbert had nothing of much importance to detain him. He felt that such was the case, for the king, too, had again sunk into a dull and gloomy state. Colbert awaited the first words from the king\u2019s lips with as much impatience as Philippe and Aramis did from their place of observation.",
    "Pain, anguish, and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the strength with which a man is endowed. We will not pretend to say that Heaven always apportions to a man\u2019s capability of endurance the anguish with which he afflicts him; for that, indeed, would not be true, since Heaven permits the existence of death, which is, sometimes, the only refuge open to those who are too closely pressed--too bitterly afflicted, as far as the body is concerned. Suffering is in proportion to the strength which has been accorded; in other words, the weak suffer more, where the trial is the same, than the strong. And what are the elementary principles, we may ask, that compose human strength? Is it not--more than anything else--exercise, habit, experience? We shall not even take the trouble to demonstrate this, for it is an axiom in morals, as in physics. When the young king, stupefied and crushed in every sense and feeling, found himself led to a cell in the Bastile, he fancied death itself is but a sleep; that it, too, has its dreams as well; that the bed had broken through the flooring of his room at Vaux; that death had resulted from the occurrence; and that, still carrying out his dream, the king, Louis XIV., now no longer living, was dreaming one of those horrors, impossible to realize in life, which is termed dethronement, imprisonment, and insult towards a sovereign who formerly wielded unlimited power. To be present at--an actual witness, too--of this bitterness of death; to float, indecisively, in an incomprehensible mystery, between resemblance and reality; to hear everything, to see everything, without interfering in a single detail of agonizing suffering, was--so the king thought within himself--a torture far more terrible, since it might last forever. \u201cIs this what is termed eternity--hell?\u201d he murmured, at the moment the door was closed upon him, which we remember Baisemeaux had shut with his own hands. He did not even look round him; and in the room, leaning with his back against the wall, he allowed himself to be carried away by the terrible supposition that he was already dead, as he closed his eyes, in order to avoid looking upon something even worse still. \u201cHow can I have died?\u201d he said to himself, sick with terror. \u201cThe bed might have been let down by some artificial means? But no! I do not remember to have felt a bruise, nor any shock either. Would they not rather have poisoned me at my meals, or with the fumes of wax, as they did my ancestress, Jeanne d\u2019Albret?\u201d Suddenly, the chill of the dungeons seemed to fall like a wet cloak upon Louis\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI have seen,\u201d he said, \u201cmy father lying dead upon his funeral couch, in his regal robes. That pale face, so calm and worn; those hands, once so skillful, lying nerveless by his side; those limbs stiffened by the icy grasp of death; nothing there betokened a sleep that was disturbed by dreams. And yet, how numerous were the dreams which Heaven might have sent that royal corpse--him whom so many others had preceded, hurried away by him into eternal death! No, that king was still the king: he was enthroned still upon that funeral couch, as upon a velvet armchair; he had not abdicated one title of his majesty. God, who had not punished him, cannot, will not punish me, who have done nothing.\u201d A strange sound attracted the young man\u2019s attention. He looked round him, and saw on the mantel-shelf, just below an enormous crucifix, coarsely painted in fresco on the wall, a rat of enormous size engaged in nibbling a piece of dry bread, but fixing all the time, an intelligent and inquiring look upon the new occupant of the cell. The king could not resist a sudden impulse of fear and disgust: he moved back towards the door, uttering a loud cry; and as if he but needed this cry, which escaped from his breast almost unconsciously, to recognize himself, Louis knew that he was alive and in full possession of his natural senses. \u201cA prisoner!\u201d he cried. \u201cI--I, a prisoner!\u201d He looked round him for a bell to summon some one to him. \u201cThere are no bells in the Bastile,\u201d he said, \u201cand it is in the Bastile I am imprisoned. In what way can I have been made a prisoner? It must have been owing to a conspiracy of M. Fouquet. I have been drawn to Vaux, as to a snare. M. Fouquet cannot be acting alone in this affair. His agent--That voice that I but just now heard was M. d\u2019Herblay\u2019s; I recognized it. Colbert was right, then. But what is Fouquet\u2019s object? To reign in my place and stead?--Impossible. Yet who knows!\u201d thought the king, relapsing into gloom again. \u201cPerhaps my brother, the Duc d\u2019Orleans, is doing that which my uncle wished to do during the whole of his life against my father. But the queen?--My mother, too? And La Valliere? Oh! La Valliere, she will have been abandoned to Madame. Dear, dear girl! Yes, it is--it must be so. They have shut her up as they have me. We are separated forever!\u201d And at this idea of separation the poor lover burst into a flood of tears and sobs and groans. \u201cThere is a governor in this place,\u201d the king continued, in a fury of passion; \u201cI will speak to him, I will summon him to me.\u201d He called--no voice replied to his. He seized hold of his chair, and hurled it against the massive oaken door. The wood resounded against the door, and awakened many a mournful echo in the profound depths of the staircase; but from a human creature, none. This was a fresh proof for the king of the slight regard in which he was held at the Bastile. Therefore, when his first fit of anger had passed away, having remarked a barred window through which there passed a stream of light, lozenge-shaped, which must be, he knew, the bright orb of approaching day, Louis began to call out, at first gently enough, then louder and louder still; but no one replied. Twenty other attempts which he made, one after another, obtained no other or better success. His blood began to boil within him, and mount to his head. His nature was such, that, accustomed to command, he trembled at the idea of disobedience. The prisoner broke the chair, which was too heavy for him to lift, and made use of it as a battering ram to strike against the door. He struck so loudly, and so repeatedly, that the perspiration soon began to pour down his face. The sound became tremendous and continuous; certain stifled, smothered cries replied in different directions. This sound produced a strange effect upon the king. He paused to listen; it was the voice of the prisoners, formerly his victims, now his companions. The voices ascended like vapors through the thick ceilings and the massive walls, and rose in accusations against the author of this noise, as doubtless their sighs and tears accused, in whispered tones, the author of their captivity. After having deprived so many people of their liberty, the king came among them to rob them of their rest. This idea almost drove him mad; it redoubled his strength, or rather his will, bent upon obtaining some information, or a conclusion to the affair. With a portion of the broken chair he recommenced the noise. At the end of an hour, Louis heard something in the corridor, behind the door of his cell, and a violent blow, which was returned upon the door itself, made him cease his own. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d said a rude, brutal voice. \u201cWhat is the matter with you this morning?\u201d \u201cThis morning!\u201d thought the king; but he said aloud, politely, \u201cMonsieur, are you the governor of the Bastile?\u201d \u201cMy good fellow, your head is out of sorts,\u201d replied the voice; \u201cbut that is no reason why you should make such a terrible disturbance. Be quiet; _mordioux!_\u201d \u201cAre you the governor?\u201d the king inquired again. He heard a door on the corridor close; the jailer had just left, not condescending to reply a single word. When the king had assured himself of his departure, his fury knew no longer any bounds. As agile as a tiger, he leaped from the table to the window, and struck the iron bars with all his might. He broke a pane of glass, the pieces of which fell clanking into the courtyard below. He shouted with increasing hoarseness, \u201cThe governor, the governor!\u201d This excess lasted fully an hour, during which time he was in a burning fever. With his hair in disorder and matted on his forehead, his dress torn and covered with dust and plaster, his linen in shreds, the king never rested until his strength was utterly exhausted, and it was not until then that he clearly understood the pitiless thickness of the walls, the impenetrable nature of the cement, invincible to every influence but that of time, and that he possessed no other weapon but despair.",
    "Fouquet was waiting with anxiety; he had already sent away many of his servants and friends, who, anticipating the usual hour of his ordinary receptions, had called at his door to inquire after him. Preserving the utmost silence respecting the danger which hung suspended by a hair above his head, he only asked them, as he did every one, indeed, who came to the door, where Aramis was. When he saw D\u2019Artagnan return, and when he perceived the bishop of Vannes behind him, he could hardly restrain his delight; it was fully equal to his previous uneasiness. The mere sight of Aramis was a complete compensation to the surintendant for the unhappiness he had undergone in his arrest. The prelate was silent and grave; D\u2019Artagnan completely bewildered by such an accumulation of events. \u201cWell, captain, so you have brought M. d\u2019Herblay to me.\u201d \u201cAnd something better still, monseigneur.\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d \u201cLiberty.\u201d \u201cI am free!\u201d \u201cYes; by the king\u2019s order.\u201d Fouquet resumed his usual serenity, that he might interrogate Aramis with a look. \u201cOh! yes, you can thank M. l\u2019eveque de Vannes,\u201d pursued D\u2019Artagnan, \u201cfor it is indeed to him that you owe the change that has taken place in the king.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Fouquet, more humiliated at the service than grateful at its success. \u201cBut you,\u201d continued D\u2019Artagnan, addressing Aramis--\u201cyou, who have become M. Fouquet\u2019s protector and patron, can you not do something for me?\u201d \u201cAnything in the wide world you like, my friend,\u201d replied the bishop, in his calmest tones. \u201cOne thing only, then, and I shall be perfectly satisfied. How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life?\u201d \u201cFrom a friend such as you are,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cI cannot conceal anything.\u201d \u201cAh! very good, tell me, then.\u201d \u201cVery well. You think that I have seen the king only twice, whilst the fact is I have seen him more than a hundred times; only we have kept it very secret, that is all.\u201d And without trying to remove the color which at this revelation made D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s face flush scarlet, Aramis turned towards M. Fouquet, who was as much surprised as the musketeer. \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d he resumed, \u201cthe king desires me to inform you that he is more than ever your friend, and that your beautiful _fete_, so generously offered by you on his behalf, has touched him to the very heart.\u201d And thereupon he saluted M. Fouquet with so much reverence of manner, that the latter, incapable of understanding a man whose diplomacy was of so prodigious a character, remained incapable of uttering a single syllable, and equally incapable of thought or movement. D\u2019Artagnan fancied he perceived that these two men had something to say to each other, and he was about to yield to that feeling of instinctive politeness which in such a case hurries a man towards the door, when he feels his presence is an inconvenience for others; but his eager curiosity, spurred on by so many mysteries, counseled him to remain. Aramis thereupon turned towards him, and said, in a quiet tone, \u201cYou will not forget, my friend, the king\u2019s order respecting those whom he intends to receive this morning on rising.\u201d These words were clear enough, and the musketeer understood them; he therefore bowed to Fouquet, and then to Aramis,--to the latter with a slight admixture of ironical respect,--and disappeared. No sooner had he left, than Fouquet, whose impatience had hardly been able to wait for that moment, darted towards the door to close it, and then returning to the bishop, he said, \u201cMy dear D\u2019Herblay, I think it now high time you should explain all that has passed, for, in plain and honest truth, I do not understand anything.\u201d \u201cWe will explain all that to you,\u201d said Aramis, sitting down, and making Fouquet sit down also. \u201cWhere shall I begin?\u201d \u201cWith this first of all. Why does the king set me at liberty?\u201d \u201cYou ought rather to ask me what his reason was for having you arrested.\u201d \u201cSince my arrest, I have had time to think over it, and my idea is that it arises out of some slight feeling of jealousy. My _fete_ put M. Colbert out of temper, and M. Colbert discovered some cause of complaint against me; Belle-Isle, for instance.\u201d \u201cNo; there is no question at all just now of Belle-Isle.\u201d \u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d \u201cDo you remember those receipts for thirteen millions which M. de Mazarin contrived to steal from you?\u201d \u201cYes, of course!\u201d \u201cWell, you are pronounced a public robber.\u201d \u201cGood heavens!\u201d \u201cOh! that is not all. Do you also remember that letter you wrote to La Valliere?\u201d \u201cAlas! yes.\u201d \u201cAnd that proclaims you a traitor and a suborner.\u201d \u201cWhy should he have pardoned me, then?\u201d \u201cWe have not yet arrived at that part of our argument. I wish you to be quite convinced of the fact itself. Observe this well: the king knows you to be guilty of an appropriation of public funds. Oh! of course _I_ know that you have done nothing of the kind; but, at all events, the king has seen the receipts, and he can do no other than believe you are incriminated.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, I do not see--\u201d \u201cYou will see presently, though. The king, moreover, having read your love-letter to La Valliere, and the offers you there made her, cannot retain any doubt of your intentions with regard to that young lady; you will admit that, I suppose?\u201d \u201cCertainly. Pray conclude.\u201d \u201cIn the fewest words. The king, we may henceforth assume, is your powerful, implacable, and eternal enemy.\u201d \u201cAgreed. But am I, then, so powerful, that he has not dared to sacrifice me, notwithstanding his hatred, with all the means which my weakness, or my misfortunes, may have given him as a hold upon me?\u201d \u201cIt is clear, beyond all doubt,\u201d pursued Aramis, coldly, \u201cthat the king has quarreled with you--irreconcilably.\u201d \u201cBut, since he has absolved me--\u201d \u201cDo you believe it likely?\u201d asked the bishop, with a searching look. \u201cWithout believing in his sincerity, I believe it in the accomplished fact.\u201d Aramis slightly shrugged his shoulders. \u201cBut why, then, should Louis XIV. have commissioned you to tell me what you have just stated?\u201d \u201cThe king charged me with no message for you.\u201d \u201cWith nothing!\u201d said the superintendent, stupefied. \u201cBut, that order--\u201d \u201cOh! yes. You are quite right. There _is_ an order, certainly;\u201d and these words were pronounced by Aramis in so strange a tone, that Fouquet could not resist starting. \u201cYou are concealing something from me, I see. What is it?\u201d Aramis softly rubbed his white fingers over his chin, but said nothing.",
    "We are come to learn of you--But in what confusion do I find you! You are as white as a miller; where have you been rummaging?\u201d\n\u201cAh, _diable!_ take care, monsieur; don\u2019t come near me till I have well shaken myself.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for? Flour or dust only whiten.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no; what you see on my arms is arsenic.\u201d\n\u201cArsenic?\u201d\n\u201cYes; I am taking my precautions against rats.\u201d\n\u201cAy, I suppose in an establishment like this, rats play a conspicuous part.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not with this establishment I concern myself, monsieur le comte. The rats have robbed me of more here than they will ever rob me of again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, you may have observed, monsieur, my inventory is being taken.\u201d\n\u201cAre you leaving trade, then?\u201d\n\u201cEh! _mon Dieu!_ yes. I have disposed of my business to one of my young men.\u201d\n\u201cBah! you are rich, then, I suppose?\u201d\n\u201cMonsieur, I have taken a dislike to the city; I don\u2019t know whether it is because I am growing old, and as M. d\u2019Artagnan one day said, when we grow old we more often think of the adventures of our youth; but for some time past I have felt myself attracted towards the country and gardening. I was a countryman formerly.\u201d And Planchet marked this confession with a rather pretentious laugh for a man making profession of humility.\n\nAthos made a gesture of approval, and then added: \u201cYou are going to buy an estate, then?\u201d\n\u201cI have bought one, monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cAh! that is still better.\u201d\n\u201cA little house at Fontainebleau, with something like twenty acres of land round it.\u201d\n\u201cVery well, Planchet! Accept my compliments on your acquisition.\u201d\n\u201cBut, monsieur, we are not comfortable here; the cursed dust makes you cough. _Corbleu!_ I do not wish to poison the most worthy gentleman in the kingdom.\u201d\nAthos did not smile at this little pleasantry which Planchet had aimed at him, in order to try his strength in mundane facetiousness.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Athos, \u201clet us have a little talk by ourselves--in your own room, for example. You have a room, have you not?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, monsieur le comte.\u201d\n\u201cUpstairs, perhaps?\u201d And Athos, seeing Planchet a little embarrassed, wished to relieve him by going first.\n\u201cIt is--but--\u201d said Planchet, hesitating.\n\nAthos was mistaken in the cause of this hesitation, and, attributing it to a fear the grocer might have of offering humble hospitality, \u201cNever mind, never mind,\u201d said he, still going up, \u201cthe dwelling of a tradesman in this quarter is not expected to be a palace. Come on.\u201d\nRaoul nimbly preceded him, and entered first. Two cries were heard simultaneously--we may say three. One of these cries dominated the others; it emanated from a woman. Another proceeded from the mouth of Raoul; it was an exclamation of surprise. He had no sooner uttered it than he shut the door sharply. The third was from fright; it came from Planchet.\n\u201cI ask your pardon!\u201d added he; \u201cmadame is dressing.\u201d\nRaoul had, no doubt, seen that what Planchet said was true, for he turned round to go downstairs again.\n\u201cMadame--\u201d said Athos. \u201cOh! pardon me, Planchet, I did not know that you had upstairs--\u201d\n\u201cIt is Truchen,\u201d added Planchet, blushing a little.\n\u201cIt is whoever you please, my good Planchet; but pardon my rudeness.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no; go up now, gentlemen.\u201d\n\u201cWe will do no such thing,\u201d said Athos.\n\u201cOh! madame, having notice, has had time--\u201d\n\u201cNo, Planchet; farewell!\u201d\n\u201cEh, gentlemen! you would not disoblige me by thus standing on the staircase, or by going away without having sat down.\u201d\n\u201cIf we had known you had a lady upstairs,\u201d replied Athos, with his customary coolness, \u201cwe would have asked permission to pay our respects to her.\u201d\n\nPlanchet was so disconcerted by this little extravagance, that he forced the passage, and himself opened the door to admit the comte and his son. Truchen was quite dressed: in the costume of the shopkeeper\u2019s wife, rich yet coquettish; German eyes attacking French eyes. She left the apartment after two courtesies, and went down into the shop--but not without having listened at the door, to know what Planchet\u2019s gentlemen visitors would say of her. Athos suspected that, and therefore turned the conversation accordingly. Planchet, on his part, was burning to give explanations, which Athos avoided. But, as certain tenacities are stronger than others, Athos was forced to hear Planchet recite his idyls of felicity, translated into a language more chaste than that of Longus. So Planchet related how Truchen had charmed the years of his advancing age, and brought good luck to his business, as Ruth did to Boaz.\n\u201cYou want nothing now, then, but heirs to your property.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had one he would have three hundred thousand livres,\u201d said Planchet.\n\u201cHumph! you must have one, then,\u201d said Athos, phlegmatically, \u201cif only to prevent your little fortune being lost.\u201d\n\nThis word _little fortune_ placed Planchet in his rank, like the voice of the sergeant when Planchet was but a _piqueur_ in the regiment of Piedmont, in which Rochefort had placed him. Athos perceived that the grocer would marry Truchen, and, in spite of fate, establish a family. This appeared the more evident to him when he learned that the young man to whom Planchet was selling the business was her cousin. Having heard all that was necessary of the happy prospects of the retiring grocer, \u201cWhat is M. d\u2019Artagnan about?\u201d said he; \u201che is not at the Louvre.\u201d\n\u201cAh! monsieur le comte, Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan has disappeared.\u201d\n\u201cDisappeared!\u201d said Athos, in surprise.\n\u201cOh! monsieur, we know what that means.\u201d\n\u201cBut _I_ do not know.\u201d\n\u201cWhenever M. d\u2019Artagnan disappears it is always for some mission or some great affair.\u201d\n\u201cHas he said anything to you about it?\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cYou were acquainted with his departure for England formerly, were you not?\u201d\n\u201cOn account of the speculation.\u201d said Planchet, heedlessly.\n\u201cThe speculation!\u201d\n\u201cI mean--\u201d interrupted Planchet, quite confused.\n\u201cWell, well; neither your affairs nor those of your master are in question; the interest we take in him alone has induced me to apply to you. Since the captain of the musketeers is not here, and as we cannot learn from you where we are likely to find M. d\u2019Artagnan, we will take our leave of you. _Au revoir_, Planchet, _au revoir_. Let us be gone, Raoul.\u201d\n\u201cMonsieur le comte, I wish I were able to tell you--\u201d\n\u201cOh, not at all; I am not the man to reproach a servant with discretion.\u201d",
    "The same day they set out for Sainte-Marguerite\u2019s, on board a _chasse-maree_ come from Toulon under orders. The impression they experienced on landing was a singularly pleasing one. The island seemed loaded with flowers and fruits. In its cultivated part it served as a garden for the governor. Orange, pomegranate, and fig trees bent beneath the weight of their golden or purple fruits. All round this garden, in the uncultivated parts, red partridges ran about in conveys among the brambles and tufts of junipers, and at every step of the comte and Raoul a terrified rabbit quitted his thyme and heath to scuttle away to the burrow. In fact, this fortunate isle was uninhabited. Flat, offering nothing but a tiny bay for the convenience of embarkation, and under the protection of the governor, who went shares with them, smugglers made use of it as a provisional _entrepot_, at the expense of not killing the game or devastating the garden. With this compromise, the governor was in a situation to be satisfied with a garrison of eight men to guard his fortress, in which twelve cannons accumulated coats of moldy green. The governor was a sort of happy farmer, harvesting wines, figs, oil, and oranges, preserving his citrons and _cedrates_ in the sun of his casemates. The fortress, encircled by a deep ditch, its only guardian, arose like three heads upon turrets connected with each other by terraces covered with moss.\n\nAthos and Raoul wandered for some time round the fences of the garden without finding any one to introduce them to the governor. They ended by making their own way into the garden. It was at the hottest time of the day. Each living thing sought its shelter under grass or stone. The heavens spread their fiery veils as if to stifle all noises, to envelop all existences; the rabbit under the broom, the fly under the leaf, slept as the wave did beneath the heavens. Athos saw nothing living but a soldier, upon the terrace beneath the second and third court, who was carrying a basket of provisions on his head. This man returned almost immediately without his basket, and disappeared in the shade of his sentry-box. Athos supposed he must have been carrying dinner to some one, and, after having done so, returned to dine himself. All at once they heard some one call out, and raising their heads, perceived in the frame of the bars of the window something of a white color, like a hand that was waved backwards and forwards--something shining, like a polished weapon struck by the rays of the sun. And before they were able to ascertain what it was, a luminous train, accompanied by a hissing sound in the air, called their attention from the donjon to the ground. A second dull noise was heard from the ditch, and Raoul ran to pick up a silver plate which was rolling along the dry sand. The hand that had thrown this plate made a sign to the two gentlemen, and then disappeared. Athos and Raoul, approaching each other, commenced an attentive examination of the dusty plate, and they discovered, in characters traced upon the bottom of it with the point of a knife, this inscription:\n\n\u201c_I am the brother of the king of France--a prisoner to-day--a madman to-morrow. French gentlemen and Christians, pray to God for the soul and the reason of the son of your old rulers_.\u201d\n\nThe plate fell from the hands of Athos whilst Raoul was endeavoring to make out the meaning of these dismal words. At the same moment they heard a cry from the top of the donjon. Quick as lightning Raoul bent down his head, and forced down that of his father likewise. A musket-barrel glittered from the crest of the wall. A white smoke floated like a plume from the mouth of the musket, and a ball was flattened against a stone within six inches of the two gentlemen.\n\u201c_Cordieu!_\u201d cried Athos. \u201cWhat, are people assassinated here? Come down, cowards as you are!\u201d\n\u201cYes, come down!\u201d cried Raoul, furiously shaking his fist at the castle.\n\nOne of the assailants--he who was about to fire--replied to these cries by an exclamation of surprise; and, as his companion, who wished to continue the attack, had re-seized his loaded musket, he who had cried out threw up the weapon, and the ball flew into the air. Athos and Raoul, seeing them disappear from the platform, expected they would come down to them, and waited with a firm demeanor. Five minutes had not elapsed, when a stroke upon a drum called the eight soldiers of the garrison to arms, and they showed themselves on the other side of the ditch with their muskets in hand. At the head of these men was an officer, whom Athos and Raoul recognized as the one who had fired the first musket. The man ordered the soldiers to \u201cmake ready.\u201d\n\u201cWe are going to be shot!\u201d cried Raoul; \u201cbut, sword in hand, at least, let us leap the ditch! We shall kill at least two of these scoundrels, when their muskets are empty.\u201d And, suiting the action to the word, Raoul was springing forward, followed by Athos, when a well-known voice resounded behind them, \u201cAthos! Raoul!\u201d\n\u201cD\u2019Artagnan!\u201d replied the two gentlemen.\n\u201cRecover arms! _Mordioux!_\u201d cried the captain to the soldiers. \u201cI was sure I could not be mistaken!\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d asked Athos. \u201cWhat! were we to be shot without warning?\u201d\n\u201cIt was I who was going to shoot you, and if the governor missed you, I should not have missed you, my dear friends. How fortunate it is that I am accustomed to take a long aim, instead of firing at the instant I raise my weapon! I thought I recognized you. Ah! my dear friends, how fortunate!\u201d And D\u2019Artagnan wiped his brow, for he had run fast, and emotion with him was not feigned.",
    "D\u2019Artagnan had set off; Fouquet likewise was gone, and with a rapidity which doubled the tender interest of his friends. The first moments of this journey, or better say, this flight, were troubled by a ceaseless dread of every horse and carriage to be seen behind the fugitive. It was not natural, in fact, if Louis XIV. was determined to seize this prey, that he should allow it to escape; the young lion was already accustomed to the chase, and he had bloodhounds sufficiently clever to be trusted. But insensibly all fears were dispersed; the surintendant, by hard traveling, placed such a distance between himself and his persecutors, that no one of them could reasonably be expected to overtake him. As to his position, his friends had made it excellent for him. Was he not traveling to join the king at Nantes, and what did the rapidity prove but his zeal to obey? He arrived, fatigued, but reassured, at Orleans, where he found, thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him, a handsome lighter of eight oars. These lighters, in the shape of gondolas, somewhat wide and heavy, containing a small chamber, covered by the deck, and a chamber in the poop, formed by a tent, then acted as passage-boats from Orleans to Nantes, by the Loire, and this passage, a long one in our days, appeared then more easy and convenient than the high-road, with its post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages. Fouquet went on board this lighter, which set out immediately. The rowers, knowing they had the honor of conveying the surintendant of the finances, pulled with all their strength, and that magic word, the _finances_, promised them a liberal gratification, of which they wished to prove themselves worthy. The lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire. Magnificent weather, a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape, displayed the river in all its limpid serenity. The current and the rowers carried Fouquet along as wings carry a bird, and he arrived before Beaugency without the slightest accident having signalized the voyage. Fouquet hoped to be the first to arrive at Nantes; there he would see the notables and gain support among the principal members of the States; he would make himself a necessity, a thing very easy for a man of his merit, and would delay the catastrophe, if he did not succeed in avoiding it entirely. \u201cBesides,\u201d said Gourville to him, \u201cat Nantes, you will make out, or we will make out, the intentions of your enemies; we will have horses always ready to convey you to Poitou, a bark in which to gain the sea, and when once upon the open sea, Belle-Isle is your inviolable port. You see, besides, that no one is watching you, no one is following.\u201d He had scarcely finished when they discovered at a distance, behind an elbow formed by the river, the masts of a huge lighter coming down. The rowers of Fouquet\u2019s boat uttered a cry of surprise on seeing this galley.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d asked Fouquet.\n\u201cThe matter is, monseigneur,\u201d replied the patron of the bark, \u201cthat it is a truly remarkable thing--that lighter comes along like a hurricane.\u201d\n\nGourville started, and mounted to the deck, in order to obtain a better view.\nFouquet did not go up with him, but said to Gourville, with restrained mistrust: \u201cSee what it is, dear friend.\u201d\n\nThe lighter had just passed the elbow. It came on so fast, that behind it might be plainly seen the white wake illumined with the fires of the day.\n\u201cHow they go,\u201d repeated the skipper, \u201chow they go! They must be well paid! I did not think,\u201d he added, \u201cthat oars of wood could behave better than ours, but yonder oarsmen prove the contrary.\u201d\n\u201cWell they may,\u201d said one of the rowers, \u201cthey are twelve, and we but eight.\u201d\n\u201cTwelve rowers!\u201d replied Gourville, \u201ctwelve! impossible.\u201d\n\nThe number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded, even for the king. This honor had been paid to monsieur le surintendant, more for the sake of haste than of respect.\n\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d said Gourville, endeavoring to distinguish beneath the tent, which was already apparent, travelers which the most piercing eye could not yet have succeeded in discovering.\n\u201cThey must be in a hurry, for it is not the king,\u201d said the patron.\nFouquet shuddered.\n\u201cBy what sign do you know that it is not the king?\u201d said Gourville.\n\u201cIn the first place, because there is no white flag with fleurs-de-lis, which the royal lighter always carries.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d said Fouquet, \u201cbecause it is impossible it should be the king, Gourville, as the king was still in Paris yesterday.\u201d\nGourville replied to the surintendant by a look which said: \u201cYou were there yourself yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cAnd by what sign do you make out they are in such haste?\u201d added he, for the sake of gaining time.\n\u201cBy this, monsieur,\u201d said the patron; \u201cthese people must have set out a long while after us, and they have already nearly overtaken us.\u201d\n\u201cBah!\u201d said Gourville, \u201cwho told you that they do not come from Beaugency or from Moit even?\u201d\n\u201cWe have seen no lighter of that shape, except at Orleans. It comes from Orleans, monsieur, and makes great haste.\u201d\n\nFouquet and Gourville exchanged a glance. The captain remarked their uneasiness, and, to mislead him, Gourville immediately said:\n\u201cSome friend, who has laid a wager he would catch us; let us win the wager, and not allow him to come up with us.\u201d\n\nThe patron opened his mouth to say that it was quite impossible, but Fouquet said with much _hauteur_,--\u201cIf it is any one who wishes to overtake us, let him come.\u201d\n\u201cWe can try, monseigneur,\u201d said the man, timidly. \u201cCome, you fellows, put out your strength; row, row!\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Fouquet, \u201con the contrary; stop short.\u201d\n\u201cMonseigneur! what folly!\u201d interrupted Gourville, stooping towards his ear.\n\u201cPull up!\u201d repeated Fouquet. The eight oars stopped, and resisting the water, created a retrograde motion. It stopped. The twelve rowers in the other did not, at first, perceive this maneuver, for they continued to urge on their boat so vigorously that it arrived quickly within musket-shot. Fouquet was short-sighted, Gourville was annoyed by the sun, now full in his eyes; the skipper alone, with that habit and clearness which are acquired by a constant struggle with the elements, perceived distinctly the travelers in the neighboring lighter.\n\u201cI can see them!\u201d cried he; \u201cthere are two.\u201d\n\u201cI can see nothing,\u201d said Gourville.\n\u201cYou will not be long before you distinguish them; in twenty strokes of their oars they will be within ten paces of us.\u201d\n\nBut what the patron announced was not realized; the lighter imitated the movement commanded by Fouquet, and instead of coming to join its pretended friends, it stopped short in the middle of the river.\n\u201cI cannot comprehend this,\u201d said the captain.\n\u201cNor I,\u201d cried Gourville.\n\u201cYou who can see so plainly the people in that lighter,\u201d resumed Fouquet, \u201ctry to describe them to us, before we are too far off.\u201d\n\u201cI thought I saw two,\u201d replied the boatman. \u201cI can only see one now, under the tent.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sort of man is he?\u201d\n\u201cHe is a dark man, broad-shouldered, bull-necked.\u201d\nA little cloud at that moment passed across the azure, darkening the sun. Gourville, who was still looking, with one hand over his eyes, became able to see what he sought, and all at once, jumping from the deck into the chamber where Fouquet awaited him: \u201cColbert!\u201d said he, in a voice broken by emotion.\n\u201cColbert!\u201d repeated Fouquet. \u201cToo strange! but no, it is impossible!\u201d\n\u201cI tell you I recognized him, and he, at the same time, so plainly recognized me, that he is just gone into the chamber on the poop. Perhaps the king has sent him on our track.\u201d",
    "The cavern of Locmaria was sufficiently distant from the mole to render it necessary for our friends to husband their strength in order to reach it. Besides, night was advancing; midnight had struck at the fort. Porthos and Aramis were loaded with money and arms. They walked, then, across the heath, which stretched between the mole and the cavern, listening to every noise, in order better to avoid an ambush. From time to time, on the road which they had carefully left on their left, passed fugitives coming from the interior, at the news of the landing of the royal troops. Aramis and Porthos, concealed behind some projecting mass of rock, collected the words that escaped from the poor people, who fled, trembling, carrying with them their most valuable effects, and tried, whilst listening to their complaints, to gather something from them for their own interest. At length, after a rapid race, frequently interrupted by prudent stoppages, they reached the deep grottoes, in which the prophetic bishop of Vannes had taken care to have secreted a bark capable of keeping the sea at this fine season.\n\n\u201cMy good friend,\u201d said Porthos, panting vigorously, \u201cwe have arrived, it seems. But I thought you spoke of three men, three servants, who were to accompany us. I don\u2019t see them--where are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should you see them, Porthos?\u201d replied Aramis. \u201cThey are certainly waiting for us in the cavern, and, no doubt, are resting, having accomplished their rough and difficult task.\u201d\n\nAramis stopped Porthos, who was preparing to enter the cavern. \u201cWill you allow me, my friend,\u201d said he to the giant, \u201cto pass in first? I know the signal I have given to these men; who, not hearing it, would be very likely to fire upon you or slash away with their knives in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on, then, Aramis; go on--go first; you impersonate wisdom and foresight; go. Ah! there is that fatigue again, of which I spoke to you. It has just seized me afresh.\u201d\n\nAramis left Porthos sitting at the entrance of the grotto, and bowing his head, he penetrated into the interior of the cavern, imitating the cry of the owl. A little plaintive cooing, a scarcely distinct echo, replied from the depths of the cave. Aramis pursued his way cautiously, and soon was stopped by the same kind of cry as he had first uttered, within ten paces of him.\n\n\u201cAre you there, Yves?\u201d said the bishop.\n\n\u201cYes, monseigneur; Goenne is here likewise. His son accompanies us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is well. Are all things ready?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, monseigneur.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to the entrance of the grottoes, my good Yves, and you will there find the Seigneur de Pierrefonds, who is resting after the fatigue of our journey. And if he should happen not to be able to walk, lift him up, and bring him hither to me.\u201d\n\nThe three men obeyed. But the recommendation given to his servants was superfluous. Porthos, refreshed, had already commenced the descent, and his heavy step resounded amongst the cavities, formed and supported by columns of porphyry and granite. As soon as the Seigneur de Bracieux had rejoined the bishop, the Bretons lighted a lantern with which they were furnished, and Porthos assured his friend that he felt as strong again as ever.\n\n\u201cLet us inspect the boat,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cand satisfy ourselves at once what it will hold.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not go too near with the light,\u201d said the patron Yves; \u201cfor as you desired me, monseigneur, I have placed under the bench of the poop, in the coffer you know of, the barrel of powder, and the musket-charges that you sent me from the fort.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Aramis; and, taking the lantern himself, he examined minutely all parts of the canoe, with the precautions of a man who is neither timid nor ignorant in the face of danger. The canoe was long, light, drawing little water, thin of keel; in short, one of those that have always been so aptly built at Belle-Isle; a little high in its sides, solid upon the water, very manageable, furnished with planks which, in uncertain weather, formed a sort of deck over which the waves might glide, so as to protect the rowers. In two well-closed coffers, placed beneath the benches of the prow and the poop, Aramis found bread, biscuit, dried fruits, a quarter of bacon, a good provision of water in leathern bottles; the whole forming rations sufficient for people who did not mean to quit the coast, and would be able to revictual, if necessity commanded. The arms, eight muskets, and as many horse-pistols, were in good condition, and all loaded. There were additional oars, in case of accident, and that little sail called _trinquet_, which assists the speed of the canoe at the same time the boatmen row, and is so useful when the breeze is slack. When Aramis had seen to all these things, and appeared satisfied with the result of his inspection, \u201cLet us consult Porthos,\u201d said he, \u201cto know if we must endeavor to get the boat out by the unknown extremity of the grotto, following the descent and the shade of the cavern, or whether it be better, in the open air, to make it slide upon its rollers through the bushes, leveling the road of the little beach, which is but twenty feet high, and gives, at high tide, three or four fathoms of good water upon a sound bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be as you please, monseigneur,\u201d replied the skipper Yves, respectfully; \u201cbut I don\u2019t believe that by the slope of the cavern, and in the dark in which we shall be obliged to maneuver our boat, the road will be so convenient as the open air. I know the beach well, and can certify that it is as smooth as a grass-plot in a garden; the interior of the grotto, on the contrary, is rough; without reckoning, monseigneur, that at its extremity we shall come to the trench which leads into the sea, and perhaps the canoe will not pass down it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have made my calculation,\u201d said the bishop, \u201cand I am certain it will pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo be it; I wish it may, monseigneur,\u201d continued Yves; \u201cbut your highness knows very well that to make it reach the extremity of the trench, there is an enormous stone to be lifted--that under which the fox always passes, and which closes the trench like a door.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be raised,\u201d said Porthos; \u201cthat is nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! I know that monseigneur has the strength of ten men,\u201d replied Yves; \u201cbut that is giving him a great deal of trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the skipper may be right,\u201d said Aramis; \u201clet us try the open-air passage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more so, monseigneur,\u201d continued the fisherman, \u201cthat we should not be able to embark before day, it will require so much labor, and that as soon as daylight appears, a good _vedette_ placed outside the grotto would be necessary, indispensable even, to watch the maneuvers of the lighters or cruisers that are on the look-out for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, Yves, your reasons are good; we will go by the beach.\u201d",
    "The explosion thundered, earth gaped, the smoke which hurled through the clefts obscured the sky; the sea flowed back as though driven by the blast of flame which darted from the grotto as if from the jaws of some gigantic fiery chimera; the reflux took the bark out twenty _toises_; the solid rocks cracked to their base, and separated like blocks beneath the operation of the wedge; a portion of the vault was carried up towards heaven, as if it had been built of cardboard; the green and blue and topaz conflagration and black lava of liquefactions clashed and combated an instant beneath a majestic dome of smoke; then oscillated, declined, and fell successively the mighty monoliths of rock which the violence of the explosion had not been able to uproot from the bed of ages; they bowed to each other like grave and stiff old men, then prostrating themselves, lay down forever in their dusty tomb.\n\nThis frightful shock seemed to restore Porthos the strength that he had lost; he arose, a giant among granite giants. But at the moment he was flying between the double hedge of granite phantoms, these latter, which were no longer supported by the corresponding links, began to roll and totter round our Titan, who looked as if precipitated from heaven amidst rocks which he had just been launching. Porthos felt the very earth beneath his feet becoming jelly-tremulous. He stretched both hands to repulse the falling rocks. A gigantic block was held back by each of his extended arms. He bent his head, and a third granite mass sank between his shoulders. For an instant the power of Porthos seemed about to fail him, but this new Hercules united all his force, and the two walls of the prison in which he was buried fell back slowly and gave him place. For an instant he appeared, in this frame of granite, like the angel of chaos, but in pushing back the lateral rocks, he lost his point of support, for the monolith which weighed upon his shoulders, and the boulder, pressing upon him with all its weight, brought the giant down upon his knees. The lateral rocks, for an instant pushed back, drew together again, and added their weight to the ponderous mass which would have been sufficient to crush ten men. The hero fell without a groan--he fell while answering Aramis with words of encouragement and hope, for, thanks to the powerful arch of his hands, for an instant he believed that, like Enceladus, he would succeed in shaking off the triple load. But by degrees Aramis beheld the block sink; the hands, strung for an instant, the arms stiffened for a last effort, gave way, the extended shoulders sank, wounded and torn, and the rocks continued to gradually collapse.\n\n\u201cPorthos! Porthos!\u201d cried Aramis, tearing his hair. \u201cPorthos! where are you? Speak!\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, here,\u201d murmured Porthos, with a voice growing evidently weaker, \u201cpatience! patience!\u201d\n\nScarcely had he pronounced these words, when the impulse of the fall augmented the weight; the enormous rock sank down, pressed by those others which sank in from the sides, and, as it were, swallowed up Porthos in a sepulcher of badly jointed stones. On hearing the dying voice of his friend, Aramis had sprung to land. Two of the Bretons followed him, with each a lever in his hand--one being sufficient to take care of the bark. The dying rattle of the valiant gladiator guided them amidst the ruins. Aramis, animated, active and young as at twenty, sprang towards the triple mass, and with his hands, delicate as those of a woman, raised by a miracle of strength the corner-stone of this great granite grave. Then he caught a glimpse, through the darkness of that charnel-house, of the still brilliant eye of his friend, to whom the momentary lifting of the mass restored a momentary respiration. The two men came rushing up, grasped their iron levers, united their triple strength, not merely to raise it, but sustain it. All was useless. They gave way with cries of grief, and the rough voice of Porthos, seeing them exhaust themselves in a useless struggle, murmured in an almost cheerful tone those supreme words which came to his lips with the last respiration, \u201cToo heavy!\u201d\n\nAfter which his eyes darkened and closed, his face grew ashy pale, the hands whitened, and the colossus sank quite down, breathing his last sigh. With him sank the rock, which, even in his dying agony he had still held up. The three men dropped the levers, which rolled upon the tumulary stone. Then, breathless, pale, his brow covered with sweat, Aramis listened, his breast oppressed, his heart ready to break.\n\nNothing more. The giant slept the eternal sleep, in the sepulcher which God had built about him to his measure.",
    "The office of the dead being celebrated, the last adieux paid to the noble departed, the assembly dispersed, talking, along the roads, of the virtues and mild death of the father, of the hopes the son had given, and of his melancholy end upon the arid coast of Africa.\n\nLittle by little, all noises were extinguished, like the lamps illuminating the humble nave. The minister bowed for the last time to the altar and the still fresh graves; then, followed by his assistant, he slowly took the road back to the presbytery. D\u2019Artagnan, left alone, perceived that night was coming on. He had forgotten the hour, thinking only of the dead. He arose from the oaken bench on which he was seated in the chapel, and wished, as the priest had done, to go and bid a last adieu to the double grave which contained his two lost friends.\n\nA woman was praying, kneeling on the moist earth. D\u2019Artagnan stopped at the door of the chapel, to avoid disturbing her, and also to endeavor to find out who was the pious friend who performed this sacred duty with so much zeal and perseverance. The unknown had hidden her face in her hands, which were white as alabaster. From the noble simplicity of her costume, she must be a woman of distinction. Outside the inclosure were several horses mounted by servants; a travelling carriage was in waiting for this lady. D\u2019Artagnan in vain sought to make out what caused her delay. She continued praying, and frequently pressed her handkerchief to her face, by which D\u2019Artagnan perceived she was weeping. He beheld her strike her breast with the compunction of a Christian woman. He heard her several times exclaim as from a wounded heart: \u201cPardon! pardon!\u201d And as she appeared to abandon herself entirely to her grief, as she threw herself down, almost fainting, exhausted by complaints and prayers, D\u2019Artagnan, touched by this love for his so much regretted friends, made a few steps towards the grave, in order to interrupt the melancholy colloquy of the penitent with the dead. But as soon as his step sounded on the gravel, the unknown raised her head, revealing to D\u2019Artagnan a face aflood with tears, a well-known face. It was Mademoiselle de la Valliere!\n\n\u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d murmured she.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d replied the captain, in a stern voice, \u201cyou here!--oh! madame, I should better have liked to see you decked with flowers in the mansion of the Comte de la Fere. You would have wept less--and they too--and I!\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsieur!\u201d said she, sobbing.\n\n\u201cFor it was you,\u201d added this pitiless friend of the dead,--\u201cit was you who sped these two men to the grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! spare me!\u201d\n\n\u201cGod forbid, madame, that I should offend a woman, or that I should make her weep in vain; but I must say that the place of the murderer is not upon the grave of her victims.\u201d\n\nShe wished to reply.\n\n\u201cWhat I now tell you,\u201d added he, coldly, \u201cI have already told the king.\u201d\n\nShe clasped her hands. \u201cI know,\u201d said she, \u201cI have caused the death of the Vicomte de Bragelonne.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! you know it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe news arrived at court yesterday. I have traveled during the night forty leagues to come and ask pardon of the comte, whom I supposed to be still living, and to pray God, on the tomb of Raoul, that he would send me all the misfortunes I have merited, except a single one. Now, monsieur, I know that the death of the son has killed the father; I have two crimes to reproach myself with; I have two punishments to expect from Heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will repeat to you, mademoiselle,\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan, \u201cwhat M. de Bragelonne said of you, at Antibes, when he already meditated death: \u2018If pride and coquetry have misled her, I pardon her while despising her. If love has produced her error, I pardon her, but I swear that no one could have loved her as I have done.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d interrupted Louise, \u201cthat of my love I was about to sacrifice myself; you know whether I suffered when you met me lost, dying, abandoned. Well! never have I suffered so much as now; because then I hoped, desired,--now I have no longer anything to wish for; because this death drags all my joy into the tomb; because I can no longer dare to love without remorse, and I feel that he whom I love--oh! it is but just!--will repay me with the tortures I have made others undergo.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Artagnan made no reply; he was too well convinced that she was not mistaken."

  "Baroness Emmuska Orczy Orczy -- The Elusive Pimpernel": [
    "There was not even a reaction. On! ever on! in that wild, surging torrent; sowing the wind of anarchy, of terrorism, of lust of blood and hate, and reaping a hurricane of destruction and of horror. On! ever on! France, with Paris and all her children still rushes blindly, madly on; defies the powerful coalition,--Austria, England, Spain, Prussia, all joined together to stem the flow of carnage,--defies the Universe and defies God!\n\nParis this September 1793!--or shall we call it Vendemiaire, Year I. of the Republic?--call it what we will! Paris! a city of bloodshed, of humanity in its lowest, most degraded aspect. France herself a gigantic self-devouring monster, her fairest cities destroyed, Lyons razed to the ground, Toulon, Marseilles, masses of blackened ruins, her bravest sons turned to lustful brutes or to abject cowards seeking safety at the cost of any humiliation.\n\nThat is thy reward, oh mighty, holy Revolution! apotheosis of equality and fraternity! grand rival of decadent Christianity.\n\nFive weeks now since Marat, the bloodthirsty Friend of the People, succumbed beneath the sheath-knife of a virgin patriot, a month since his murderess walked proudly, even enthusiastically, to the guillotine! There has been no reaction--only a great sigh!... Not of content or satisfied lust, but a sigh such as the man-eating tiger might heave after his first taste of long-coveted blood.\n\nA sigh for more!\n\nA king on the scaffold; a queen degraded and abased, awaiting death, which lingers on the threshold of her infamous prison; eight hundred scions of ancient houses that have made the history of France; brave generals, Custine, Blanchelande, Houchard, Beauharnais; worthy patriots, noble-hearted women, misguided enthusiasts, all by the score and by the hundred, up the few wooden steps which lead to the guillotine.\n\nAn achievement of truth!\n\nAnd still that sigh for more!\n\nBut for the moment,--a few seconds only,--Paris looked round her mighty self, and thought things over! The man-eating tiger for the space of a sigh licked his powerful jaws and pondered!\n\nSomething new!--something wonderful!\n\nWe have had a new Constitution, a new Justice, new Laws, a new Almanack!\n\nWhat next?\n\nWhy, obviously!--How comes it that great, intellectual, aesthetic Paris never thought of such a wonderful thing before?\n\nA new religion!\n\nChristianity is old and obsolete, priests are aristocrats, wealthy oppressors of the People, the Church but another form of wanton tyranny.\n\nLet us by all means have a new religion.\n\nAlready something has been done to destroy the old! To destroy! always to destroy! Churches have been ransacked, altars spoliated, tombs desecrated, priests and curates murdered; but that is not enough.\n\nThere must be a new religion; and to attain that there must be a new God.\n\n\"Man is a born idol-worshipper.\"\n\nVery well then! let the People have a new religion and a new God.\n\nStay!--Not a God this time!--for God means Majesty, Power, Kingship! everything in fact which the mighty hand of the people of France has struggled and fought to destroy.\n\nNot a God, but a goddess.\n\nA goddess! an idol! a toy! since even the man-eating tiger must play sometimes.\n\nParis wanted a new religion, and a new toy, and grave men, ardent patriots, mad enthusiasts, sat in the Assembly of the Convention and seriously discussed the means of providing her with both these things which she asked for.\n\nChaumette, I think it was, who first solved the difficulty:--Procureur Chaumette, head of the Paris Municipality, he who had ordered that the cart which bore the dethroned queen to the squalid prison of the Conciergerie should be led slowly past her own late palace of the Tuileries, and should be stopped there just long enough for her to see and to feel in one grand mental vision all that she had been when she dwelt there, and all that she now was by the will of the People.\n\nChaumette, as you see, was refined, artistic;--the torture of the fallen Queen's heart meant more to him than a blow of the guillotine on her neck.\n\nNo wonder, therefore, that it was Procureur Chaumette who first discovered exactly what type of new religion Paris wanted just now.\n\n\"Let us have a Goddess of Reason,\" he said, \"typified if you will by the most beautiful woman in Paris. Let us have a feast of the Goddess of Reason, let there be a pyre of all the gew-gaws which for centuries have been flaunted by overbearing priests before the eyes of starving multitudes, let the People rejoice and dance around that funeral pile, and above it all let the new Goddess tower smiling and triumphant. The Goddess of Reason! the only deity our new and regenerate France shall acknowledge throughout the centuries which are to come!\"\n\nLoud applause greeted the impassioned speech.\n\n\"A new goddess, by all means!\" shouted the grave gentlemen of the National Assembly, \"the Goddess of Reason!\"\n\nThey were all eager that the People should have this toy; something to play with and to tease, round which to dance the mad Carmagnole and sing the ever-recurring \"Ca ira.\" Something to distract the minds of the populace from the consequences of its own deeds, and the helplessness of its legislators.\n\nProcureur Chaumette enlarged upon his original idea; like a true artist who sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then fills in the minute details, he was already busy elaborating his scheme.\n\n\"The goddess must be beautiful... not too young... Reason can only go hand in hand with the riper age of second youth... she must be decked out in classical draperies, severe yet suggestive... she must be rouged and painted... for she is a mere idol... easily to be appeased with incense, music and laughter.\"\n\nHe was getting deeply interested in his subject, seeking minutiae of detail, with which to render his theme more and more attractive.\n\nBut patience was never the characteristic of the Revolutionary Government of France. The National Assembly soon tired of Chaumette's dithyrambic utterances. Up aloft on the Mountain, Danton was yawning like a gigantic leopard.\n\nSoon Henriot was on his feet. He had a far finer scheme than that of the Procureur to place before his colleagues. A grand National fete, semi-religious in character, but of the new religion which destroyed and desecrated and never knelt in worship.\n\nCitizen Chaumette's Goddess of Reason by all means--Henriot conceded that the idea was a good one--but the goddess merely as a figure-head: around her a procession of unfrocked and apostate priests, typifying the destruction of ancient hierarchy, mules carrying loads of sacred vessels, the spoils of ten thousand churches of France, and ballet girls in bacchanalian robes, dancing the Carmagnole around the new deity.\n\nPublic Prosecutor Foucquier Tinville thought all these schemes very tame. Why should the People of France be led to think that the era of a new religion would mean an era of milk and water, of pageants and of fireworks? Let every man, woman, and child know that this was an era of blood and again of blood.\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed in passionate accents, \"would that all the traitors in France had but one head, that it might be cut off with one blow of the guillotine!\"\n\nHe approved of the National fete, but he desired an apotheosis of the guillotine; he undertook to find ten thousand traitors to be beheaded on one grand and glorious day: ten thousand heads to adorn the Place de la Revolution on a great, never-to-be-forgotten evening, after the guillotine had accomplished this record work.\n\nBut Collot d'Herbois would also have his say. Collot lately hailed from the South, with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled throughout the whole of this horrible decade. He would not be outdone by Tinville's bloodthirsty schemes.\n\nHe was the inventor of the \"Noyades,\" which had been so successful at Lyons and Marseilles. \"Why not give the inhabitants of Paris one of these exhilarating spectacles?\" he asked with a coarse, brutal laugh.\n\nThen he explained his invention, of which he was inordinately proud. Some two or three hundred traitors, men, women, and children, tied securely together with ropes in great, human bundles and thrown upon a barge in the middle of the river: the barge with a hole in her bottom! not too large! only sufficient to cause her to sink slowly, very slowly, in sight of the crowd of delighted spectators.\n\nThe cries of the women and children, and even of the men, as they felt the waters rising and gradually enveloping them, as they felt themselves powerless even for a fruitless struggle, had proved most exhilarating, so Citizen Collot declared, to the hearts of the true patriots of Lyons.",
    "Robespierre had quietly waited the while. He was in no hurry: being a night-bird of very pronounced tastes, he was quite ready to sit here until the small hours of the morning watching Citizen Chauvelin mentally writhing in the throes of recollections of the past few months. There was nothing that delighted the sea-green Incorruptible quite so much as the aspect of a man struggling with a hopeless situation and feeling a net of intrigue drawing gradually tighter and tighter around him. Even now, when he saw Chauvelin's smooth forehead wrinkled into an anxious frown, and his thin hand nervously clutched upon the table, Robespierre heaved a pleasurable sigh, leaned back in his chair, and said with an amiable smile:\n\n\"You do agree with me, then, Citizen, that the situation has become intolerable?\"\n\nThen as Chauvelin did not reply, he continued, speaking more sharply:\n\n\"And how terribly galling it all is, when we could have had that man under the guillotine by now, if you had not blundered so terribly last year.\"\n\nHis voice had become hard and trenchant like that knife to which he was so ready to make constant allusion. But Chauvelin still remained silent. There was really nothing that he could say.\n\n\"Citizen Chauvelin, how you must hate that man!\" exclaimed Robespierre at last.\n\nThen only did Chauvelin break the silence which up to now he had appeared to have forced himself to keep.\n\n\"I do!\" he said with unmistakable fervour.\n\n\"Then why do you not make an effort to retrieve the blunders of last year?\" queried Robespierre blandly. \"The Republic has been unusually patient and long-suffering with you, Citizen Chauvelin. She has taken your many services and well-known patriotism into consideration. But you know,\" he added significantly, \"that she has no use for worthless tools.\"\n\nThen as Chauvelin seemed to have relapsed into sullen silence, he continued with his original ill-omened blandness:\n\n\"Ma foi! Citizen Chauvelin, were I standing in your buckled shoes, I would not lose another hour in trying to avenge mine own humiliation!\"\n\n\"Have I ever had a chance?\" burst out Chauvelin with ill-suppressed vehemence. \"What can I do single-handed? Since war has been declared I cannot go to England unless the Government will find some official reason for my doing so. There is much grumbling and wrath over here, and when that damned Scarlet Pimpernel League has been at work, when a score or so of valuable prizes have been snatched from under the very knife of the guillotine, then, there is much gnashing of teeth and useless cursings, but nothing serious or definite is done to smother those accursed English flies which come buzzing about our ears.\"\n\n\"Nay! you forget, Citizen Chauvelin,\" retorted Robespierre, \"that we of the Committee of Public Safety are far more helpless than you. You know the language of these people, we don't. You know their manners and customs, their ways of thought, the methods they are likely to employ: we know none of these things. You have seen and spoken to men in England who are members of that damned League. You have seen the man who is its leader. We have not.\"\n\nHe leant forward on the table and looked more searchingly at the thin, pallid face before him.\n\n\"If you named that leader to me now, if you described him, we could go to work more easily. You could name him, and you would, Citizen Chauvelin.\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" retorted Chauvelin doggedly.\n\n\"Ah! but I think you could. But there! I do not blame your silence. You would wish to reap the reward of your own victory, to be the instrument of your own revenge. Passions! I think it natural! But in the name of your own safety, Citizen, do not be too greedy with your secret. If the man is known to you, find him again, find him, lure him to France! We want him--the people want him! And if the people do not get what they want, they will turn on those who have withheld their prey.\"\n\n\"I understand, Citizen, that your own safety and that of your government is involved in this renewed attempt to capture the Scarlet Pimpernel,\" retorted Chauvelin drily.\n\n\"And your head, Citizen Chauvelin,\" concluded Robespierre.\n\n\"Nay! I know that well enough, and you may believe me, and you will, Citizen, when I say that I care but little about that. The question is, if I am to lure that man to France what will you and your government do to help me?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" replied Robespierre, \"provided you have a definite plan and a definite purpose.\"\n\n\"I have both. But I must go to England in, at least, a semi-official capacity. I can do nothing if I am to hide in disguise in out-of-the-way corners.\"\n\n\"That is easily done. There has been some talk with the British authorities anent the security and welfare of peaceful French subjects settled in England. After a good deal of correspondence they have suggested our sending a semi-official representative over there to look after the interests of our own people commercially and financially. We can easily send you over in that capacity if it would suit your purpose.\"\n\n\"Admirably. I have only need of a cloak. That one will do as well as another.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Not quite. I have several plans in my head, and I must know that I am fully trusted. Above all, I must have power--decisive, absolute, illimitable power.\"\n\nThere was nothing of the weakling about this small, sable-clad man, who looked the redoubtable Jacobin leader straight in the face and brought a firm fist resolutely down upon the table before him. Robespierre paused a while ere he replied; he was eying the other man keenly, trying to read if behind that earnest, frowning brow there did not lurk some selfish, ulterior motive along with that demand for absolute power. But Chauvelin did not flinch beneath that gaze which could make every cheek in France blanch with unnamed terror, and after that slight moment of hesitation Robespierre said quietly:\n\n\"You shall have the complete power of a military dictator in every town or borough of France which you may visit. The Revolutionary Government shall create you, before you start for England, Supreme Head of all the Sub-Committees of Public Safety. This will mean that in the name of the safety of the Republic every order given by you, of whatsoever nature it might be, must be obeyed implicitly under pain of an arraignment for treason.\"\n\nChauvelin sighed a quick, sharp sigh of intense satisfaction, which he did not even attempt to disguise before Robespierre.\n\n\"I shall want agents,\" he said, \"or shall we say spies? and, of course, money.\"\n\n\"You shall have both. We keep a very efficient secret service in England and they do a great deal of good over there. There is much dissatisfaction in their Midland counties--you remember the Birmingham riots? They were chiefly the work of our own spies. Then you know Candeille, the actress? She had found her way among some of those circles in London who have what they call liberal tendencies. I believe they are called Whigs. Funny name, isn't it? It means perruque, I think. Candeille has given charity performances in aid of our Paris poor, in one or two of these Whig clubs, and incidentally she has been very useful to us.\"\n\n\"A woman is always useful in such cases. I shall seek out the Citizeness Candeille.\"\n\n\"And if she renders you useful assistance, I think I can offer her what should prove a tempting prize. Women are so vain!\" he added, contemplating with rapt attention the enamel-like polish on his finger-nails. \"There is a vacancy in the Maison Moliere. Or--what might prove more attractive still--in connection with the proposed National fete, and the new religion for the people, we have not yet chosen a Goddess of Reason. That should appeal to any feminine mind. The impersonation of a goddess, with processions, pageants, and the rest... Great importance and prominence given to one personality.... What say you, Citizen? If you really have need of a woman for the furtherance of your plans, you have that at your disposal which may enhance her zeal.\"",
    "It was perhaps the most brilliant September ever known in England, where the last days of dying summer are nearly always golden and beautiful. Strange that in this country, where that same season is so peculiarly radiant with a glory all its own, there should be no special expression in the language with which to accurately name it. So we needs must call it \"fin d'ete\": the ending of the summer; not the absolute end, nor yet the ultimate departure, but the tender lingering of a friend obliged to leave us anon, yet who fain would steal a day here and there, a week or so in which to stay with us: who would make that last pathetic farewell of his endure a little while longer still, and brings forth in gorgeous array for our final gaze all that he has which is most luxuriant, most desirable, most worthy of regret.\n\nAnd in this year of grace 1793, departing summer had lavished the treasures of her palette upon woodland and river banks; had tinged the once crude green of larch and elm with a tender hue of gold, had brushed the oaks with tones of warm russet, and put patches of sienna and crimson on the beech. In the gardens the roses were still in bloom, not the delicate blush or lemon ones of June, nor yet the pale Banksias and climbers, but the full-blooded red roses of late summer, and deep-coloured apricot ones, with crinkled outside leaves faintly kissed by the frosty dew. In sheltered spots the purple clematis still lingered, whilst the dahlias, brilliant of hue, seemed overbearing in their gorgeous insolence, flaunting their crudely colored petals against sober backgrounds of mellow leaves, or the dull, mossy tones of ancient, encircling walls.\n\nThe Gala had always been held about the end of September. The weather, on the riverside, was most dependable then, and there was always sufficient sunshine as an excuse for bringing out Madam's last new muslin gown, or her pale-coloured quilted petticoat. Then the ground was dry and hard, good alike for walking and for setting up tents and booths. And of these there was of a truth a most goodly array this year: mountebanks and jugglers from every corner of the world, so it seemed, for there was a man with a face as black as my lord's tricorne, and another with such flat yellow cheeks as made one think of batter pudding, and spring aconite, of eggs and other very yellow things. There was a tent wherein dogs--all sorts of dogs, big, little, black, white or tan--did things which no Christian with respect for his own backbone would have dared to perform, and another where a weird-faced old man made bean-stalks and walking sticks, coins of the realm and lace kerchiefs vanish into thin air.\n\nAnd as it was nice and hot one could sit out upon the green and listen to the strains of the band, which discoursed sweet music, and watch the young people tread a measure on the sward.\n\nThe quality had not yet arrived: for humbler folk had partaken of very early dinner so as to get plenty of fun, and long hours of delight for the sixpenny toll demanded at the gates. There was so much to see and so much to do: games of bowls on the green, and a beautiful Aunt Sally, there was a skittle alley, and two merry-go-rounds: there were performing monkeys and dancing bears, a woman so fat that three men with arms outstretched could not get round her, and a man so thin that he could put a lady's bracelet round his neck and her garter around his waist. There were some funny little dwarfs with pinched faces and a knowing manner, and a giant come all the way from Russia--so 'twas said.\n\nThe mechanical toys too were a great attraction. You dropped a penny into a little slit in a box and a doll would begin to dance and play the fiddle: and there was the Magic Mill, where for another modest copper a row of tiny figures, wrinkled and old and dressed in the shabbiest of rags, marched in weary procession up a flight of steps into the Mill, only to emerge again the next moment at a further door of this wonderful building looking young and gay, dressed in gorgeous finery and tripping a dance measure as they descended some steps and were finally lost to view.\n\nBut what was most wonderful of all and collected the goodliest crowd of gazers and the largest amount of coins, was a miniature representation of what was going on in France even at this very moment. And you could not help but be convinced of the truth of it all, so cleverly was it done. There was a background of houses and a very red-looking sky. \"Too red!\" some people said, but were immediately quashed by the dictum of the wise, that the sky represented a sunset, as anyone who looked could see. Then there were a number of little figures, no taller than your hand, but with little wooden faces and arms and legs, just beautifully made little dolls, and these were dressed in kirtles and breeches--all rags mostly--and little coats and wooden shoes. They were massed together in groups with their arms all turned upwards.\n\nAnd in the center of this little stage on an elevated platform there were miniature wooden posts close together, and with a long flat board at right angles at the foot of the posts, and all painted a bright red. At the further end of the boards was a miniature basket, and between the two posts, at the top, was a miniature knife which ran up and down in a groove and was drawn by a miniature pulley. Folk who knew said that this was a model of a guillotine.\n\nAnd lo behold! when you dropped a penny into a slot just below the wooden stage, the crowd of little figures started waving their arms up and down, and another little doll would ascend the elevated platform and lie down on the red board at the foot of the wooden posts. Then a figure dressed in brilliant scarlet put out an arm presumably to touch the pulley, and the tiny knife would rattle down on to the poor little reclining doll's neck, and its head would roll off into the basket beyond. Then there was a loud whirr of wheels, a buzz of internal mechanism, and all the little figures would stop dead with arms outstretched, whilst the beheaded doll rolled off the board and was lost to view, no doubt preparatory to going through the same gruesome pantomime again.\n\nIt was very thrilling, and very terrible: a certain air of hushed awe reigned in the booth where this mechanical wonder was displayed. The booth itself stood in a secluded portion of the grounds, far from the toll gates, and the band stand and the noise of the merry-go-round, and there were great texts, written in red letters on a black ground, pinned all along the walls.\n\n\"Please spare a copper for the starving poor of Paris.\"\n\nA lady, dressed in grey quilted petticoat and pretty grey and black striped paniers, could be seen walking in the booth from time to time, then disappearing through a partition beyond. She would emerge again presently carrying an embroidered reticule, and would wander round among the crowd, holding out the bag by its chain, and repeating in tones of somewhat monotonous appeal: \"For the starving poor of Paris, if you please!\"  She had fine, dark eyes, rather narrow and tending upwards at the outer corners, which gave her face a not altogether pleasant expression. Still, they were fine eyes, and when she went round soliciting alms, most of the men put a hand into their breeches pocket and dropped a coin into her embroidered reticule. She said the word \"poor\" in rather a funny way, rolling the \"r\" at the end, and she also said \"please\" as if it were spelt with a long line of \"e's,\" and so it was concluded that she was French and was begging for her poorer sisters. At stated intervals during the day, the mechanical toy was rolled into a corner, and the lady in grey stood up on a platform and sang queer little songs, the words of which nobody could understand.\n\n\"Il etait une bergere et ron et petit pataplon....\"\n\nBut it all left an impression of sadness and of suppressed awe upon the minds and susceptibilities of the worthy Richmond yokels come with their wives or sweethearts to enjoy the fun of the fair, and gladly did everyone emerge out of that melancholy booth into the sunshine, the brightness and the noise.",
    "But before Marguerite had time to utter a reply, she felt her arm nervously clutched by a hot and trembling hand. \"Who... who is this woman?\" murmured Juliette Marny close to her ear. The young girl looked pale and very agitated, and her large eyes were fixed in unmistakable wrath upon the French actress before her. A little startled, not understanding Juliette's attitude, Marguerite tried to reply lightly: \"This is Mademoiselle Candeille, Juliette dear,\" she said, affecting the usual formal introduction, \"of the Varietes Theatre of Paris--Mademoiselle Desiree Candeille, who will sing some charming French ditties for us to-night.\" While she spoke she kept a restraining hand on Juliette's quivering arm. Already, with the keen intuition which had been on the qui-vive the whole evening, she scented some mystery in this sudden outburst on the part of her young protegee.\n\nBut Juliette did not heed her: she felt surging up in her young, overburdened heart all the wrath and the contempt of the persecuted, fugitive aristocrat against the triumphant usurper. She had suffered so much from that particular class of the risen kitchen-wench of which the woman before her was so typical and example: years of sorrow, of poverty were behind her: loss of fortune, of kindred, of friends--she, even now a pauper, living on the bounty of strangers. And all this through no fault of her own: the fault of her class mayhap! but not hers!\n\nShe had suffered much, and was still overwrought and nerve-strung: for some reason she could not afterwards have explained, she felt spiteful and uncontrolled, goaded into stupid fury by the look of insolence and of triumph with which Candeille calmly regarded her. Afterwards she would willingly have bitten out her tongue for her vehemence, but for the moment she was absolutely incapable of checking the torrent of her own emotions.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Candeille, indeed?\" she said in wrathful scorn, \"Desiree Candeille, you mean, Lady Blakeney! my mother's kitchen-maid, flaunting shamelessly my dear mother's jewels which she has stolen mayhap...\"\n\nThe young girl was trembling from head to foot, tears of anger obscured her eyes; her voice, which fortunately remained low--not much above a whisper--was thick and husky.\n\n\"Juliette! Juliette! I entreat you,\" admonished Marguerite, \"you must control yourself, you must, indeed you must. Mademoiselle Candeille, I beg of you to retire....\"\n\nBut Candeille--well-schooled in the part she had to play--had no intention of quitting the field of battle. The more wrathful and excited Mademoiselle de Marny became the more insolent and triumphant waxed the young actress' whole attitude. An ironical smile played round the corners of her mouth, her almond-shaped eyes were half-closed, regarding through dropping lashed the trembling figure of the young impoverished aristocrat. Her head was thrown well back, in obvious defiance of the social conventions, which should have forbidden a fracas in Lady Blakeney's hospitable house, and her fingers provocatively toyed with the diamond necklace which glittered and sparkled round her throat.\n\nShe had no need to repeat the words of a well-learnt part: her own wit, her own emotions and feelings helped her to act just as her employer would have wished her to do. Her native vulgarity helped her to assume the very bearing which he would have desired. In fact, at this moment Desiree Candeille had forgotten everything save the immediate present: a more than contemptuous snub from one of those penniless aristocrats, who had rendered her own sojourn in London so unpleasant and unsuccessful.\n\nShe had suffered from these snubs before, but had never had the chance of forcing an esclandre, as a result of her own humiliation. That spirit of hatred for the rich and idle classes, which was so characteristic of revolutionary France, was alive and hot within her: she had never had an opportunity--she, the humble fugitive actress from a minor Paris theatre--to retort with forcible taunts to the ironical remarks made at and before her by the various poverty-stricken but haughty emigres who swarmed in those very same circles of London society into which she herself had vainly striven to penetrate.\n\nNow at last, one of this same hated class, provoked beyond self-control, was allowing childish and unreasoning fury to outstrip the usual calm irony of aristocratic rebuffs.\n\nJuliette had paused awhile, in order to check the wrathful tears which, much against her will, were choking the words in her throat and blinding her eyes.\n\n\"Hoity! toity!\" laughed Candeille, \"hark at the young baggage!\"\n\nBut Juliette had turned to Marguerite and began explaining volubly: \"My mother's jewels!\" she said in the midst of her tears, \"ask her how she came by them. When I was obliged to leave the home of my fathers,--stolen from me by the Revolutionary Government--I contrived to retain my mother's jewels... you remember, I told you just now.... The Abbe Foucquet--dear old man! Saved them for me... that and a little money which I had... he took charge of them... he said he would place them in safety with the ornaments of his church, and now I see them round that woman's neck... I know that he would not have parted with them save with his life.\"\n\nAll the while that the young girl spoke in a voice half-choked with sobs, Marguerite tried with all the physical and mental will at her command to drag her out of the room and thus to put a summary ending to this unpleasant scene. She ought to have felt angry with Juliette for this childish and senseless outburst, were it not for the fact that somehow she knew within her innermost heart that all this had been arranged and preordained: not by Fate--not by a Higher Hand, but by the most skilful intriguer present-day France had ever known.\n\nAnd even now, as she was half succeeding in turning Juliette away from the sight of Candeille, she was not the least surprised or startled at seeing Chauvelin standing in the very doorway through which she had hoped to pass. One glance at his face had made her fears tangible and real: there was a look of satisfaction and triumph in his pale, narrow eyes, a flash in them of approbation directed at the insolent attitude of the French actress: he looked like the stage-manager of a play, content with the effect his own well-arranged scenes were producing.",
    "\"Place first, Monsieur?\" suggested Sir Percy.\n\n\"As you will, sir,\" assented Chauvelin.\n\nHe took up a dice-box which one of the gentlemen handed to him and the two men threw.\n\n\"'Tis mine, Monsieur,\" said Blakeney carelessly, \"mine to name the place where shall occur this historic encounter, 'twixt the busiest man in France and the most idle fop that e'er disgraced these three kingdoms.... Just for the sake of argument, sir, what place would you suggest?\"\n\n\"Oh! the exact spot is immaterial, Sir Percy,\" replied Chauvelin coldly, \"the whole of France stands at your disposal.\"\n\n\"Aye! I thought as much, but could not be quite sure of such boundless hospitality,\" retorted Blakeney imperturbably. \"Do you care for the woods around Paris, sir?\"\n\n\"Too far from the coast, sir. I might be sea-sick crossing over the Channel, and glad to get the business over as soon as possible.... No, not Paris, sir--rather let us say Boulogne.... Pretty little place, Boulogne... do you not think so...?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, Sir Percy.\"\n\n\"Then Boulogne it is.. the ramparts, an you will, on the south side of the town.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" rejoined Chauvelin drily. \"Shall we throw again?\"\n\nA murmur of merriment had accompanied this brief colloquy between the adversaries, and Blakeney's bland sallies were received with shouts of laughter. Now the dice rattled again and once more the two men threw.\n\n\"'Tis yours this time, Monsieur Chauvelin,\" said Blakeney, after a rapid glance at the dice. \"See how evenly Chance favours us both. Mine, the choice of place... admirably done you'll confess.... Now yours the choice of time. I wait upon your pleasure, sir.... The southern ramparts at Boulogne--when?\"\n\n\"The fourth day from this, sir, at the hour when the Cathedral bell chimes the evening Angelus,\" came Chauvelin's ready reply.\n\n\"Nay! but methought that your demmed government had abolished Cathedrals, and bells and chimes.... The people of France have now to go to hell their own way... for the way to heaven has been barred by the National Convention.... Is that not so?... Methought the Angelus was forbidden to be rung.\"\n\n\"Not at Boulogne, I think, Sir Percy,\" retorted Chauvelin drily, \"and I'll pledge you my word that the evening Angelus shall be rung that night.\"\n\n\"At what hour is that, sir?\"\n\n\"One hour after sundown.\"\n\n\"But why four days after this? Why not two or three?\"\n\n\"I might have asked, why the southern ramparts, Sir Percy; why not the western? I chose the fourth day--does it not suit you?\" asked Chauvelin ironically.\n\n\"Suit me! Why, sir, nothing could suit me better,\" rejoined Blakeney with his pleasant laugh. \"Zounds! but I call it marvellous... demmed marvellous... I wonder now,\" he added blandly, \"what made you think of the Angelus?\"\n\nEveryone laughed at this, a little irrelevantly perhaps.\n\n\"Ah!\" continued Blakeney gaily, \"I remember now.... Faith! to think that I was nigh forgetting that when last you and I met, sir, you had just taken or were about to take Holy Orders.... Ah! how well the thought of the Angelus fits in with your clerical garb.... I recollect that the latter was mightily becoming to you, sir...\"\n\n\"Shall we proceed to settle the conditions of the fight, Sir Percy?\" said Chauvelin, interrupting the flow of his antagonist's gibes, and trying to disguise his irritation beneath a mask of impassive reserve.\n\n\"The choice of weapons you mean,\" here interposed His Royal Highness, \"but I thought that swords had already been decided on.\"\n\n\"Quite so, your Highness,\" assented Blakeney, \"but there are various little matters in connection with this momentous encounter which are of vast importance.... Am I not right, Monsieur?... Gentlemen, I appeal to you.... Faith! one never knows... my engaging opponent here might desire that I should fight him in green socks, and I that he should wear a scarlet flower in his coat.\"\n\n\"The Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy?\"\n\n\"Why not, Monsieur? It would look so well in your buttonhole, against the black of the clerical coat, which I understand you sometime affect in France... and when it is withered and quite dead you would find that it would leave an overpowering odour in your nostrils, far stronger than that of incense.\"\n\nThere was general laughter after this. The hatred which every member of the French revolutionary government--including, of course, ex-Ambassador Chauvelin--bore to the national hero was well known.\n\n\"The conditions then, Sir Percy,\" said Chauvelin, without seeming to notice the taunt conveyed in Blakeney's last words. \"Shall we throw again?\"\n\n\"After you, sir,\" acquiesced Sir Percy.",
    "As she neared the terrace, she became conscious of several forms moving about at the foot of the steps, some few feet below where she was standing. Soon she saw the glimmer of lanthorns, heard whispering voices, and the lapping of the water against the side of a boat. Anon a figure, laden with cloaks and sundry packages, passed down the steps close beside her. Even in the darkness Marguerite recognized Benyon, her husband's confidential valet. Without a moment's hesitation, she flew along the terrace towards the wing of the house occupied by Sir Percy. She had not gone far before she discerned his tall figure walking leisurely along the path which here skirted part of the house. He had on his large caped coat, which was thrown open in front, displaying a grey travelling suit of fine cloth; his hands were as usual buried in the pockets of his breeches, and on his head he wore the folding chapeau-bras which he habitually affected.\n\nBefore she had time to think, or to realize that he was going, before she could utter one single word, she was in his arms, clinging to him with passionate intensity, trying in the gloom to catch every expression of his eyes, every quiver of the face now bent down so close to her.\n\n\"Percy, you cannot go... you cannot go!...\" she pleaded.\n\nShe had felt his strong arms closing round her, his lips seeking hers, her eyes, her hair, her clinging hands, which dragged at his shoulders in a wild agony of despair.\n\n\"If you really loved me, Percy,\" she murmured, \"you would not go, you would not go...\"\n\nHe would not trust himself to speak; it well-nigh seemed as if his sinews cracked with the violent effort at self-control. Oh! how she loved him, when she felt in him the passionate lover, the wild, untamed creature that he was at heart, on whom the frigid courtliness of manner sat but as a thin veneer. This was his own real personality, and there was little now of the elegant and accomplished gentleman of fashion, schooled to hold every emotion in check, to hide every thought, every desire save that for amusement or for display.\n\nShe--feeling her power and his weakness now--gave herself wholly to his embrace, not grudging one single, passionate caress, yielding her lips to him, the while she murmured: \"You cannot go... you cannot... why should you go?... It is madness to leave me... I cannot let you go...\"\n\nHer arms clung tenderly round him, her voice was warm and faintly shaken with suppressed tears, and as he wildly murmured: \"Don't! for pity's sake!\" she almost felt that her love would be triumphant.\n\n\"For pity's sake, I'll go on pleading, Percy!\" she whispered. \"Oh! my love, my dear! do not leave me!... we have scarce had time to savour our happiness.. we have such arrears of joy to make up.... Do not go, Percy... there's so much I want to say to you.... Nay! you shall not! you shall not!\" she added with sudden vehemence. \"Look me straight in the eyes, my dear, and tell me if you can leave now?\"\n\nHe did not reply, but, almost roughly, he placed his hand over her tear-dimmed eyes, which were turned up to his, in an agony of tender appeal. Thus he blindfolded her with that wild caress. She should not see--no, not even she!--that for the space of a few seconds stern manhood was well-nigh vanquished by the magic of her love. All that was most human in him, all that was weak in this strong and untamed nature, cried aloud for peace and luxury and idleness: for long summer afternoons spent in lazy content, for the companionship of horses and dogs and of flowers, with no thought or cares save those for the next evening's gavotte, no graver occupation save that of sitting at HER feet.\n\nAnd during these few seconds, whilst his hand lay across her eyes, the lazy, idle fop of fashionable London was fighting a hand-to-hand fight with the bold leader of a band of adventurers: and his own passionate love for his wife ranged itself with fervent intensity on the side of his weaker self. Forgotten were the horrors of the guillotine, the calls of the innocent, the appeal of the helpless; forgotten the daring adventures, the excitements, the hair's-breadth escapes; for those few seconds, heavenly in themselves, he only remembered her--his wife--her beauty and her tender appeal to him.\n\nShe would have pleaded again, for she felt that she was winning in this fight: her instinct--that unerring instinct of the woman who loves and feels herself beloved--told her that for the space of an infinitesimal fraction of time, his iron will was inclined to bend; but he checked her pleading with a kiss.\n\nThen there came a change. Like a gigantic wave carried inwards by the tide, his turbulent emotion seemed suddenly to shatter itself against a rock of self-control. Was it a call from the boatmen below? a distant scrunching of feet upon the gravel?--who knows, perhaps only a sigh in the midnight air, a ghostly summons from the land of dreams that recalled him to himself. Even as Marguerite was still clinging to him, with the ardent fervour of her own passion, she felt the rigid tension of his arms relax, the power of his embrace weaken, the wild love-light become dim in his eyes. He kissed her fondly, tenderly, and with infinite gentleness smoothed away the little damp curls from her brow. There was a wistfulness now in his caress, and in his kiss there was the finality of a long farewell.",
    "\"Ah, yes!\" he sighed. \"But I am very helpless. This was my cell. I had been here with Francois and Felicite, my sister's children, you know. Innocent lambs, whom those fiends would lead to slaughter. Last night,\" he continued, speaking volubly, \"the soldiers came in and dragged Francois and Felicite out of this room, where, in spite of the danger before us, in spite of what we suffered, we had contrived to be quite happy together. I could read the Mass, and the dear children would say their prayers night and morning at my knee.\"\n\nHe paused awhile. The unshed tears in his mild blue eyes struggled for freedom now, and one or two flowed slowly down his wrinkled cheek. Marguerite, though heartsore and full of agonizing sorrow herself, felt her whole noble soul go out to this kind old man, so pathetic, so high and simple-minded in his grief.\n\nShe said nothing, however, and the Abbe continued after a few seconds' silence.\n\n\"When the children had gone, they brought you in here, mon enfant, and laid you on the paillasse where Felicite used to sleep. You looked very white, and stricken down, like one of God's lambs attacked by the ravening wolf. Your eyes were closed and you were blissfully unconscious. I was taken before the governor of the prison, and he told me that you would share the cell with me for a time, and that I was to watch you night and day, because...\"\n\nThe old man paused again. Evidently what he had to say was very difficult to put into words. He groped in his pockets and brought out a large bandana handkerchief, red and yellow and green, with which he began to mop his moist forehead. The quaver in his voice and the trembling of his hands became more apparent and pronounced.\n\n\"Yes, M. l'Abbe? Because?...\" queried Marguerite gently.\n\n\"They said that if I guarded you well, Felicite and Francois would be set free,\" replied the old man after a while, during which he made vigorous efforts to overcome his nervousness, \"and that if you escaped the children and I would be guillotined the very next day.\"\n\nThere was silence in the little room now. The Abbe was sitting quite still, clasping his trembling fingers, and Marguerite neither moved nor spoke. What the old man had just said was very slowly finding its way to the innermost cells of her brain. Until her mind had thoroughly grasped the meaning of it all, she could not trust herself to make a single comment.\n\nIt was some seconds before she fully understood it all, before she realized what it meant not only to her, but indirectly to her husband. Until now she had not been fully conscious of the enormous wave of hope which almost in spite of herself had risen triumphant above the dull, grey sea of her former despair; only now when it had been shattered against this deadly rock of almost superhuman devilry and cunning did she understand what she had hoped, and what she must now completely forswear.\n\nNo bolts and bars, no fortified towers or inaccessible fortresses could prove so effectual a prison for Marguerite Blakeney as the dictum which morally bound her to her cell.\n\n\"If you escape the children and I would be guillotined the very next day.\"\n\nThis meant that even if Percy knew, even if he could reach her, he could never set her free, since her safety meant death to two innocent children and to this simple hearted man.\n\nIt would require more than the ingenuity of the Scarlet Pimpernel himself to untie this Gordian knot.\n\n\"I don't mind for myself, of course,\" the old man went on with gentle philosophy. \"I have lived my life. What matters if I die to-morrow, or if I linger on until my earthly span is legitimately run out? I am ready to go home whenever my Father calls me. But it is the children, you see. I have to think of them. Francois is his mother's only son, the bread-winner of the household, a good lad and studious too, and Felicite has always been very delicate. She is blind from birth and...\"\n\n\"Oh! don't... for pity's sake, don't...\" moaned Marguerite in an agony of helplessness. \"I understand... you need not fear for your children, M. l'Abbe: no harm shall come to them through me.\"\n\n\"It is as the good God wills!\" replied the old man quietly.\n\nThen, as Marguerite had once more relapsed into silence, he fumbled for his beads, and his gentle voice began droning the Paters and Aves wherein no doubt his child-like heart found peace and solace.\n\nHe understood that the poor woman would not wish to speak, he knew as well as she did the overpowering strength of his helpless appeal. Thus the minutes sped on, the jailer and the captive, tied to one another by the strongest bonds that hand of man could forge, had nothing to say to one another: he, the old priest, imbued with the traditions of his calling, could pray and resign himself to the will of the Almighty, but she was young and ardent and passionate, she loved and was beloved, and an impassable barrier was built up between her and the man she worshipped!\n\nA barrier fashioned by the weak hands of children, one of whom was delicate and blind. Outside was air and freedom, reunion with her husband, an agony of happy remorse, a kiss from his dear lips, and trembling held her back from it all, because of Francois who was the bread-winner and of Felicite who was blind.",
    "In his memorable interview with Robespierre, the day before he left for England, Chauvelin had asked that absolute power be given him, in order that he might carry out the plans for the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel, which he had in his mind. Now that he was back in France he had no cause to complain that the revolutionary government had grudged him this power for which he had asked.\n\nImplicit obedience had followed whenever he had commanded.\n\nAs soon as he heard that a woman had been arrested in the act of uttering a passport in the name of Celine Dumont, he guessed at once that Marguerite Blakeney had, with characteristic impulse, fallen into the trap which, with the aid of the woman Candeille, he had succeeded in laying for her.\n\nHe was not the least surprised at that. He knew human nature, feminine nature, far too well, ever to have been in doubt for a moment that Marguerite would follow her husband without calculating either costs or risks.\n\nYe gods! the irony of it all! Had she not been called the cleverest woman in Europe at one time? Chauvelin himself had thus acclaimed her, in those olden days, before she and he became such mortal enemies, and when he was one of the many satellites that revolved round brilliant Marguerite St. Just. And to-night, when a sergeant of the town guards brought him news of her capture, he smiled grimly to himself; the cleverest woman in Europe had failed to perceive the trap laid temptingly open for her.\n\nOnce more she had betrayed her husband into the hands of those who would not let him escape a second time. And now she had done it with her eyes open, with loving, passionate heart which ached for self-sacrifice, and only succeeded in imperilling the loved one more hopelessly than before.\n\nThe sergeant was waiting for orders. Citizen Chauvelin had come to Boulogne, armed with more full and more autocratic powers than any servant of the new republic had ever been endowed with before. The governor of the town, the captain of the guard, the fort and municipality were all as abject slaves before him.\n\nAs soon as he had taken possession of the quarters organized for him in the town hall, he had asked for a list of prisoners who for one cause or another were being detained pending further investigations.\n\nThe list was long and contained many names which were of not the slightest interest to Chauvelin: he passed them over impatiently.\n\n\"To be released at one,\" he said curtly.\n\nHe did not want the guard to be burdened with unnecessary duties, nor the prisons of the little sea-port town to be inconveniently encumbered. He wanted room, space, air, the force and intelligence of the entire town at his command for the one capture which meant life and revenge to him.\n\n\"A woman--name unknown--found in possession of a forged passport in the name of Celine Dumont, maid to the Citizeness Desiree Candeille--attempted to land--was interrogated and failed to give satisfactory explanation of herself--detained in room No. 6 of the Gayole prison.\"\n\nThis was one of the last names on the list, the only one of any importance to Citizen Chauvelin. When he read it he nearly drove his nails into the palms of his hands, so desperate an effort did he make not to betray before the sergeant by look or sigh the exultation which he felt.\n\nFor a moment he shaded his eyes against the glare of the lamp, but it was not long before he had formulated a plan and was ready to give his orders.\n\nHe asked for a list of prisoners already detained in the various forts. The name of l'Abbe Foucquet with those of his niece and nephew attracted his immediate attention. He asked for further information respecting these people, heard that the boy was a widow's only son, the sole supporter of his mother's declining years: the girl was ailing, suffering from incipient phthisis, and was blind.\n\nPardi! the very thing! L'Abbe himself, the friend of Juliette Marny, the pathetic personality around which this final adventure of the Scarlet Pimpernel was intended to revolve! and these two young people! his sister's children! one of them blind and ill, the other full of vigour and manhood.\n\nCitizen Chauvelin had soon made up his mind.\n\nA few quick orders to the sergeant of the guard, and l'Abbe Foucquet, weak, helpless and gentle, became the relentless jailer who would guard Marguerite more securely than a whole regiment of loyal soldiers could have done.\n\nThen, having despatched a messenger to the Committee of Public Safety, Chauvelin laid himself down to rest. Fate had not deceived him. He had thought and schemed and planned, and events had shaped themselves exactly as foreseen, and the fact that Marguerite Blakeney was at the present moment a prisoner in his hands was merely the result of his own calculations.\n\nAs for the Scarlet Pimpernel, Chauvelin could not very well conceive what he would do under these present circumstances. The duel on the southern ramparts had of course become a farce, not likely to be enacted now that Marguerite's life was at stake. The daring adventurer was caught in a network at last, from which all his ingenuity, all his wit, his impudence and his amazing luck could never extricate him.",
    "\"Lady Blakeney,\" began Chauvelin after he had quickly dismissed the soldiers from the room, \"when you and I parted from one another just now, I had no idea that I should so soon have the pleasure of a personal conversation with Sir Percy.... There is no occasion yet, believe me, for sorrow or fear.... Another twenty-four hours at most, and you will be on board the 'Day-Dream' outward bound for England. Sir Percy himself might perhaps accompany you; he does not desire that you should journey to Paris, and I may safely say, that in his mind, he has already accepted certain little conditions which I have been forced to impose upon him ere I sign the order for your absolute release.\"\n\n\"Conditions?\" she repeated vaguely and stupidly, looking in bewilderment from one to the other.\n\n\"You are tired, m'dear,\" said Sir Percy quietly, \"will you not sit down?\"\n\nHe held the chair gallantly for her. She tried to read his face, but could not catch even a flash from beneath the heavy lids which obstinately veiled his eyes.\n\n\"Oh! it is a mere matter of exchanging signatures,\" continued Chauvelin in response to her inquiring glance and toying with the papers which were scattered on the table. \"Here you see is the order to allow Sir Percy Blakeney and his wife, nee Marguerite St. Just, to quit the town of Boulogne unmolested.\"\n\nHe held a paper out towards Marguerite, inviting her to look at it. She caught sight of an official-looking document, bearing the motto and seal of the Republic of France, and of her own name and Percy's written thereon in full.\n\n\"It is perfectly en regle, I assure you,\" continued Chauvelin, \"and only awaits my signature.\"\n\nHe now took up another paper which looked like a long closely-written letter. Marguerite watched his every movement, for instinct told her that the supreme moment had come. There was a look of almost superhuman cruelty and malice in the little Frenchman's eyes as he fixed them on the impassive figure of Sir Percy, the while with slightly trembling hands he fingered that piece of paper and smoothed out its creases with loving care.\n\n\"I am quite prepared to sign the order for your release, Lady Blakeney,\" he said, keeping his gaze still keenly fixed upon Sir Percy. \"When it is signed you will understand that our measures against the citizens of Boulogne will no longer hold good, and that on the contrary, the general amnesty and free pardon will come into force.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand that,\" she replied.\n\n\"And all that will come to pass, Lady Blakeney, the moment Sir Percy will write me in his own hand a letter, in accordance with the draft which I have prepared, and sign it with his name.\n\nShall I read it to you?\" he asked.\n\n\"If you please.\"\n\n\"You will see how simple it all is.... A mere matter of form.... I pray you do not look upon it with terror, but only as the prelude to that general amnesty and free pardon, which I feel sure will satisfy the philanthropic heart of the noble Scarlet Pimpernel, since three score at least of the inhabitants of Boulogne will owe their life and freedom to him.\"\n\n\"I am listening, Monsieur,\" she said calmly.\n\n\"As I have already had the honour of explaining, this little document is in the form of a letter addressed personally to me and of course in French,\" he said finally, and then he looked down on the paper and began to read:\n\nCitizen Chauvelin--\n\nIn consideration of a further sum of one million francs and on the understanding that this ridiculous charge brought against me of conspiring against the Republic of France is immediately withdrawn, and I am allowed to return to England unmolested, I am quite prepared to acquaint you with the names and whereabouts of certain persons who under the guise of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel are even now conspiring to free the woman Marie Antoinette and her son from prison and to place the latter upon the throne of France. You are quite well aware that under the pretence of being the leader of a gang of English adventurers, who never did the Republic of France and her people any real harm, I have actually been the means of unmasking many a royalist plot before you, and of bringing many persistent conspirators to the guillotine. I am surprised that you should cavil at the price I am asking this time for the very important information with which I am able to furnish you, whilst you have often paid me similar sums for work which was a great deal less difficult to do. In order to serve your government effectually, both in England and in France, I must have a sufficiency of money, to enable me to live in a costly style befitting a gentleman of my rank. Were I to alter my mode of life I could not continue to mix in that same social milieu to which all my friends belong and wherein, as you are well aware, most of the royalist plots are hatched.\n\nTrusting therefore to receive a favourable reply to my just demands within the next twenty-four hours, whereupon the names in question shall be furnished you forthwith,\n\nI have the honour to remain, Citizen,\n\nYour humble and obedient servant,\n\nWhen he had finished reading, Chauvelin quietly folded the paper up again, and then only did he look at the man and the woman before him.\n\nMarguerite sat very erect, her head thrown back, her face very pale and her hands tightly clutched in her lap. She had not stirred whilst Chauvelin read out the infamous document, with which he desired to brand a brave man with the ineradicable stigma of dishonour and of shame. After she heard the first words, she looked up swiftly and questioningly at her husband, but he stood at some little distance from her, right out of the flickering circle of yellowish light made by the burning tallow-candle. He was as rigid as a statue, standing in his usual attitude with legs apart and hands buried in his breeches pockets.\n\nShe could not see his face.\n\nWhatever she may have felt with regard to the letter, as the meaning of it gradually penetrated into her brain, she was, of course, convinced of one thing, and that was that never for a moment would Percy dream of purchasing his life or even hers at such a price. But she would have liked some sign from him, some look by which she could be guided as to her immediate conduct: as, however, he gave neither look nor sign, she preferred to assume an attitude of silent contempt.",
    "Once more the two men were alone. As far as Chauvelin was concerned he felt that everything was not yet settled, and until a moment ago he had been in doubt as to whether Sir Percy would accept the infamous conditions which had been put before him, or allow his pride and temper to get the better of him and throw the deadly insults back into his adversary's teeth. But now a new secret had been revealed to the astute diplomatist. A name, softly murmured by a broken-hearted woman, had told him a tale of love and passion, which he had not even suspected before. Since he had made this discovery he knew that the ultimate issue was no longer in doubt. Sir Percy Blakeney, the bold adventurer, ever ready for a gamble where lives were at stake, might have demurred before he subscribed to his own dishonour, in order to save his wife from humiliation and the shame of the terrible fate that had been mapped out for her. But the same man passionately in love with such a woman as Marguerite Blakeney would count the world well lost for her sake.\n\nOne sudden fear alone had shot through Chauvelin's heart when he stood face to face with the two people whom he had so deeply and cruelly wronged, and that was that Blakeney, throwing aside all thought of the scores of innocent lives that were at stake, might forget everything, risk everything, dare everything, in order to get his wife away there and then. For the space of a few seconds Chauvelin had felt that his own life was in jeopardy, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel would indeed make a desperate effort to save himself and his wife. But the fear was short-lived: Marguerite--as he had well foreseen--would never save herself at the expense of others, and she was tied! tied! tied! That was his triumph and his joy!\n\nWhen Marguerite finally left the room, Sir Percy made no motion to follow her, but turned once more quietly to his antagonist.\n\n\"As you were saying, Monsieur?...\" he queried lightly.\n\n\"Oh! there is nothing more to say, Sir Percy,\" rejoined Chauvelin; \"my conditions are clear to you, are they not? Lady Blakeney's and your own immediate release in exchange for a letter written to me by your own hand, and signed here by you--in this room--in my presence and that of sundry other persons whom I need not name just now. Also certain money passing from my hand to yours. Failing the letter, a long, hideously humiliating sojourn in the Temple prison for your wife, a prolonged trial and the guillotine as a happy release!... I would add, the same thing for yourself, only that I will do you the justice to admit that you probably do not care.\"\n\n\"Nay! a grave mistake, Monsieur.... I do care... vastly care, I assure you ... and would seriously object to ending my life on your demmed guillotine... a nasty, uncomfortable thing, I should say... and I am told that an inexperienced barber is deputed to cut one's hair.... Brrr!... Now, on the other hand, I like the idea of a national fete... that pretty wench Candeille, dressed as a goddess... the boom of the cannon when your amnesty comes into force.... You WILL boom the cannon, will you not, Monsieur?... Cannon are demmed noisy, but they are effective sometimes, do you not think so, Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Very effective certainly, Sir Percy,\" sneered Chauvelin, \"and we will certainly boom the cannon from this very fort, an it so please you....\"\n\n\"At what hour, Monsieur, is my letter to be ready?\"\n\n\"Why! at any hour you please, Sir Percy.\"\n\n\"The 'Day-Dream' could weigh anchor at eight o'clock... would an hour before that be convenient to yourself?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Sir Percy... if you will honour me by accepting my hospitality in these uncomfortable quarters until seven o'clock to-morrow eve?...\"\n\n\"I thank you, Monsieur...\"\n\n\"Then am I to understand, Sir Percy, that...\"\n\nA loud and ringing laugh broke from Blakeney's lips.\n\n\"That I accept your bargain, man!... Zounds! I tell you I accept... I'll write the letter, I'll sign it... an you have our free passes ready for us in exchange.... At seven o'clock to-morrow eve, did you say?... Man! do not look so astonished.... The letter, the signature, the money... all your witnesses... have everything ready.... I accept, I say.... And now, in the name of all the evil spirits in hell, let me have some supper and a bed, for I vow that I am demmed fatigued.\"\n\nAnd without more ado Sir Percy once more rang the handbell, laughing boisterously the while: then suddenly, with quick transition of mood, his laugh was lost in a gigantic yawn, and throwing his long body onto a chair, he stretched out his legs, buried his hands in his pockets, and the next moment was peacefully asleep.",
    "Boulogne had gone through many phases, in its own languid and sleepy way, whilst the great upheaval of a gigantic revolution shook other cities of France to their very foundations. At first the little town had held somnolently aloof, and whilst Lyons and Tours conspired and rebelled, whilst Marseilles and Toulon opened their ports to the English and Dunkirk was ready to surrender to the allied forces, she had gazed through half-closed eyes at all the turmoil, and then quietly turned over and gone to sleep again. Boulogne fished and mended nets, built boats and manufactured boots with placid content, whilst France murdered her king and butchered her citizens. The initial noise of the great revolution was only wafted on the southerly breezes from Paris to the little seaport towns of Northern France, and lost much of its volume and power in this aerial transit: the fisher folk were too poor to worry about the dethronement of kings: the struggle for daily existence, the perils and hardships of deep-sea fishing engrossed all the faculties they possessed.\n\nAs for the burghers and merchants of the town, they were at first content with reading an occasional article in the \"Gazette de Paris\" or the \"Gazette des Tribunaux,\" brought hither by one or other of the many travellers who crossed the city on their way to the harbour. They were interested in these articles, at times even comfortably horrified at the doings in Paris, the executions and the tumbrils, but on the whole they liked the idea that the country was in future to be governed by duly chosen representatives of the people, rather than be a prey to the despotism of kings, and they were really quite pleased to see the tricolour flag hoisted on the old Beffroi, there where the snow-white standard of the Bourbons had erstwhile flaunted its golden fleur-de-lis in the glare of the midday sun. The worthy burgesses of Boulogne were ready to shout: \"Vive la Republique!\" with the same cheerful and raucous Normandy accent as they had lately shouted \"Dieu protege le Roi!\"\n\nThe first awakening from this happy torpor came when that tent was put up on the landing stage in the harbour. Officials, dressed in shabby uniforms and wearing tricolour cockades and scarves, were now quartered in Town Hall, and repaired daily to that roughly erected tent, accompanied by so many soldiers from the garrison. There installed, they busied themselves with examining carefully the passports of all those who desired to leave or enter Boulogne. Fisher-folk who had dwelt in the city--father and son and grandfather and many generations before that--and had come and gone in and out of their own boats as they pleased, were now stopped as they beached their craft and made to give an account of themselves to these officials from Paris.\n\nIt was, of a truth, more than ridiculous, that these strangers should ask of Jean-Marie who he was, or of Pierre what was his business, or of Desire Francois whither he was going, when Jean-Marie and Pierre and Desire Francois had plied their nets in the roads outside Boulogne harbour for more years than they would care to count. It also caused no small measure of annoyance that fishermen were ordered to wear tricolour cockades on their caps. They had no special ill-feeling against tricolour cockades, but they did not care about them. Jean-Marie flatly refused to have one pinned on, and being admonished somewhat severely by one of the Paris officials, he became obstinate about the whole thing and threw the cockade violently on the ground and spat upon it, not from any sentiment of anti-republicanism, but just from a feeling of Norman doggedness. He was arrested, shut up in Fort Gayole, tried as a traitor and publicly guillotined.\n\nThe consternation in Boulogne was appalling. The one little spark had found its way to a barrel of blasting powder and caused a terrible explosion. Within twenty-four hours of Jean-Marie's execution the whole town was in the throes of the Revolution. What the death of King Louis, the arrest of Marie Antoinette, the massacres of September had failed to do, that the arrest and execution of an elderly fisherman accomplished in a trice. People began to take sides in politics. Some families realized that they came from ancient lineage, and that their ancestors had helped to build up the throne of the Bourbons. Others looked up ancient archives and remembered past oppressions at the hands of the aristocrats. Thus some burghers of Boulogne became ardent reactionaries, whilst others secretly nursed enthusiastic royalist convictions: some were ready to throw in their lot with the anarchists, to deny the religion of their fathers, to scorn the priests and close the places of worship; others adhered strictly still to the usages and practices of the Church. Arrest became frequent: the guillotine, erected in the Place de la Senechaussee, had plenty of work to do. Soon the cathedral was closed, the priests thrown into prison, whilst scores of families hoped to escape a similar fate by summary flight. Vague rumours of a band of English adventurers soon reached the little sea-port town. The Scarlet Pimpernel--English spy or hero, as he was alternately called--had helped many a family with pronounced royalist tendencies to escape the fury of the blood-thirsty Terrorists. Thus gradually the anti-revolutionaries had been weeded out of the city: some by death and imprisonment, others by flight. Boulogne became the hotbed of anarchism: the idlers and loafers, inseparable from any town where there is a garrison and a harbour, practically ruled the city now. Denunciations were the order of the day. Everyone who owned any money, or lived with any comfort was accused of being a traitor and suspected of conspiracy. The fisher folk wandered about the city, surly and discontented: their trade was at a standstill, but there was a trifle to be earned by giving information: information which meant the arrest, ofttimes the death of men, women and even children who had tried to seek safety in flight, and to denounce whom--as they were trying to hire a boat anywhere along the coast--meant a good square meal for a starving family.",
    "\"Citizens of Boulogne, awake!\"\n\nThey had not slept, only some of them had fallen into drowsy somnolence, heavy and nerve-racking, worse indeed than any wakefulness. Within the houses, the women too had kept the tedious vigil, listening for every sound, dreading every bit of news, which the wind might waft in through the small, open windows. If one prisoner escaped, every family in Boulogne would be deprived of the bread-winner. Therefore the women wept, and tried to remember those Paters and Aves which the tyranny of liberty, fraternity and equality had ordered them to forget. Broken rosaries were fetched out from neglected corners, and knees stiff with endless, thankless toil were bent once more in prayer.\n\n\"Oh God! Good God! Do not allow that woman to flee!\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin! Mother of God! Make that she should not escape!\"\n\nSome of the women went out in the early dawn to take hot soup and coffee to their men who were watching outside the prison.\n\n\"Has anything been seen?\"\n\n\"Have ye seen the woman?\"\n\n\"Which room is she in?\"\n\n\"Why won't they let us see her?\"\n\n\"Are you sure she hath not already escaped?\"\n\nQuestions and surmises went round in muffled whispers as the steaming cans were passed round. No one had a definite answer to give, although Desire Melun declared that he had, once during the night, caught sight of a woman's face at one of the windows above: but as he could not describe the woman's face, nor locate with any degree of precision the particular window at which she was supposed to have appeared, it was unanimously decided that Desire must have been dreaming.\n\n\"Citizens of Boulogne, awake!\"\n\nThe cry came first from the Town Hall, and therefore from behind the crowd of men and women, whose faces had been so resolutely set for all these past hours towards the Gayole prison. They were all awake! but too tired and cramped to move as yet, and to turn in the direction whence arose that cry.\n\n\"Citizens of Boulogne, awake!\"\n\nIt was just the voice of Auguste Moleux, the town-crier of Boulogne, who, bell in hand, was trudging his way along the Rue Daumont, closely followed by two fellows of the municipal guard. Auguste was in the very midst of the sullen crowd, before the men even troubled about his presence here, but now with many a vigorous \"Allons donc!\" and \"Voyez-moi ca, fais donc place, voyons!\" he elbowed his way through the throng. He was neither tired nor cramped; he served the Republic in comfort and ease, and had slept soundly on his paillasse in the little garret allotted to him in the Town Hall. The crowd parted in silence, to allow him to pass. Auguste was lean and powerful, the scanty and meagre food, doled out to him by a paternal government, had increased his muscular strength whilst reducing his fat. He had very hard elbows, and soon he managed, by dint of pushing and cursing to reach the gateway of Gayole.\n\n\"Voyons! enlevez-moi ca,\" he commanded in stentorian tones, pointing to the proclamation.\n\nThe fellows of the municipal guard fell to and tore the parchment away from the door whilst the crowd looked on with stupid amazement. What did it all mean?\n\nThen Auguste Moleux turned and faced the men.\n\n\"Mes enfants,\" he said, \"my little cabbages! wake up! the government of the Republic has decreed that to-day is to be a day of gaiety and public rejoicings!\"\n\n\"Gaiety?... Public rejoicings forsooth, when the bread-winner of every family...\"\n\n\"Hush! Hush! Be silent, all of you,\" quoth Auguste impatiently, \"you do not understand!... All that is at an end... There is no fear that the woman shall escape.... You are all to dance and rejoice.... The Scarlet Pimpernel has been captured in Boulogne, last night...\"\n\n\"Qui ca the Scarlet Pimpernel?\"\n\n\"Mais! 'tis that mysterious English adventurer who rescued people from the guillotine!\"\n\n\"A hero? quoi?\"\n\n\"No! no! only an English spy, a friend of aristocrats... he would have cared nothing for the bread-winners of Boulogne...\"\n\n\"He would not have raised a finger to save them.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" sighed a feminine voice, \"perhaps he came to Boulogne to help them.\"\n\n\"And he has been caught anyway,\" concluded Auguste Moleux sententiously, \"and, my little cabbages, remember this, that so great is the pleasure of the all-powerful Committee of Public Safety at this capture, that because he has been caught in Boulogne, therefore Boulogne is to be specially rewarded!\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin, who'd have thought it?\"\n\n\"Sh... Jeanette, dost not know that there's no Holy Virgin now?\"\n\n\"And dost know, Auguste, how we are to be rewarded?\"\n\nIt is a difficult matter for the human mind to turn very quickly from despair to hope, and the fishermen of Boulogne had not yet grasped the fact that they were to make merry and that thoughts of anxiety must be abandoned for those of gaiety. Auguste Moleux took out a parchment from the capacious pocket of his coat; he put on his most solemn air of officialdom, and pointing with extended forefinger to the parchment, he said:\n\n\"A general amnesty to all natives of Boulogne who are under arrest at the present moment: a free pardon to all natives of Boulogne who are under sentence of death: permission to all natives of Boulogne to quit the town with their families, to embark on any vessel they please, in or out of the harbour, and to go whithersoever they choose, without passports, formalities or questions of any kind.\""

  "Rudyard Kipling -- \"Captains Courageous\": A Story of the Grand Banks": [
    "The weather door of the smoking-room had been left open to the North Atlantic fog, as the big liner rolled and lifted, whistling to warn the fishing-fleet. \"That Cheyne boy's the biggest nuisance aboard,\" said a man in a frieze overcoat, shutting the door with a bang. \"He isn't wanted here. He's too fresh.\"\n\nA white-haired German reached for a sandwich, and grunted between bites: \"I know der breed. Ameriga is full of dot kind. I dell you you should imbort ropes' ends free under your dariff.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! There isn't any real harm to him. He's more to be pitied than anything,\" a man from New York drawled, as he lay at full length along the cushions under the wet skylight. \"They've dragged him around from hotel to hotel ever since he was a kid. I was talking to his mother this morning. She's a lovely lady, but she don't pretend to manage him. He's going to Europe to finish his education.\"\n\n\"Education isn't begun yet.\" This was a Philadelphian, curled up in a corner. \"That boy gets two hundred a month pocket-money, he told me. He isn't sixteen either.\"\n\n\"Railroads, his father, aind't it?\" said the German.\n\n\"Yep. That and mines and lumber and shipping. Built one place at San Diego, the old man has; another at Los Angeles; owns half a dozen railroads, half the lumber on the Pacific slope, and lets his wife spend the money,\" the Philadelphian went on lazily. \"The West don't suit her, she says. She just tracks around with the boy and her nerves, trying to find out what'll amuse him, I guess. Florida, Adirondacks, Lakewood, Hot Springs, New York, and round again. He isn't much more than a second-hand hotel clerk now. When he's finished in Europe he'll be a holy terror.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally?\" said a voice from the frieze ulster.\n\n\"Old man's piling up the rocks. 'Don't want to be disturbed, I guess. He'll find out his error a few years from now. 'Pity, because there's a heap of good in the boy if you could get at it.\"\n\n\"Mit a rope's end; mit a rope's end!\" growled the German.\n\n\nOnce more the door banged, and a slight, slim-built boy perhaps fifteen years old, a half-smoked cigarette hanging from one corner of his mouth, leaned in over the high footway. His pasty yellow complexion did not show well on a person of his years, and his look was a mixture of irresolution, bravado, and very cheap smartness. He was dressed in a cherry-coloured blazer, knickerbockers, red stockings, and bicycle shoes, with a red flannel cap at the back of the head. After whistling between his teeth, as he eyed the company, he said in a loud, high voice: \"Say, it's thick outside. You can hear the fish-boats squawking all around us. Say, wouldn't it be great if we ran down one?\"\n\n\"Shut the door, Harvey,\" said the New Yorker. \"Shut the door and stay outside. You're not wanted here.\"\n\n\"Who'll stop me?\" he answered deliberately. \"Did you pay for my passage, Mister Martin? 'Guess I've as good right here as the next man.\"\n\nHe picked up some dice from a checker-board and began throwing, right hand against left. \"Say, gen'elmen, this is deader'n mud. Can't we make a game of poker between us?\"\n\nThere was no answer, and he puffed his cigarette, swung his legs, and drummed on the table with rather dirty fingers. Then he pulled out a roll of bills as if to count them.\n\n\"How's your mamma this afternoon?\" a man said. \"I didn't see her at lunch.\"\n\n\"In her state-room, I guess. She's 'most always sick on the ocean. I'm going to give the stewardess fifteen dollars for looking after her. I don't go down more 'n I can avoid. It makes me feel mysterious to pass that butler's-pantry place. Say, this is the first time I've been on the ocean.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't apologise, Harvey.\"\n\n\"Who's apologising? This is the first time I've crossed the ocean, gen'elmen, and, except the first day, I haven't been sick one little bit. No, sir!\" He brought down his fist with a triumphant bang, wetted his finger, and went on counting the bills.\n\n\"Oh, you're a high-grade machine, with the writing in plain sight,\" the Philadelphian yawned. \"You'll blossom into a credit to your country if you don't take care.\"\n\n\"I know it. I'm an American--first, last, and all the time. I'll show 'em that when I strike Europe. Pif! My cig's out. I can't smoke the truck the steward sells. Any gen'elman got a real Turkish cig on him?\"\n\nThe chief engineer entered for a moment, red, smiling, and wet. \"Say, Mac,\" cried Harvey, cheerfully, \"how are we hitting it?\"\n\n\"Vara much in the ordinary way,\" was the grave reply. \"The young are as polite as ever to their elders, an' their elders are e'en tryin' to appreciate it.\"\n\nA low chuckle came from a corner. The German opened his cigar-case and handed a skinny black cigar to Harvey. \"Dot is der broper apparatus to smoke, my young friendt,\" he said. \"You vill dry it? Yes? Den you vill be efer so happy.\"\n\nHarvey lit the unlovely thing with a flourish: he felt that he was getting on in grown-up society. \"It would take more 'n this to keel me over,\" he said, ignorant that he was lighting that terrible article, a Wheeling \"stogie.\"\n\n\"Dot we shall bresently see,\" said the German. \"Where are we now, Mr. Mactonal'?\"\n\n\"Just there or thereabouts, Mr. Schaefer,\" said the engineer. \"We'll be on the Grand Bank to-night; but in a general way o' speakin', we're all among the fishing-fleet now. We've shaved three dories an' near skelped the boom off a Frenchman since noon, an' that's close sailin', ye may say.\"\n\n\"You like my cigar, eh?\" the German asked, for Harvey's eyes were full of tears.\n\n\"Fine, full flavour,\" he answered through shut teeth. \"Guess we've slowed down a little, haven't we? I'll skip out and see what the log says.\"\n\n\"I might if I vhas you,\" said the German.\n\n\nHarvey staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail. He was very unhappy; but he saw the deck-steward lashing chairs together, and, since he had boasted before the man that he was never seasick, his pride made him go aft to the second-saloon deck at the stern, which was finished in a turtle-back. The deck was deserted, and he crawled to the extreme end of it, near the flagpole. There he doubled up in limp agony, for the Wheeling \"stogie\" joined with the surge and jar of the screw to sieve out his soul. His head swelled; sparks of fire danced before his eyes; his body seemed to lose weight, while his heels wavered in the breeze. He was fainting from seasickness, and a roll of the ship tilted him over the rail on to the smooth lip of the turtle-back. Then a low, grey mother-wave swung out of the fog, tucked Harvey under one arm, so to speak, and pulled him off and away to leeward; the great green closed over him, and he went quietly to sleep.\n\nHe was roused by the sound of a dinner-horn such as they used to blow at a summer-school he had once attended in the Adirondacks. Slowly he remembered that he was Harvey Cheyne, drowned and dead in mid-ocean, but was too weak to fit things together. A new smell filled his nostrils; wet and clammy chills ran down his back, and he was helplessly full of salt water. When he opened his eyes, he perceived that he was still on the top of the sea, for it was running round him in silver-coloured hills, and he was lying on a pile of half-dead fish, looking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey. \"It's no good,\" thought the boy. \"I'm dead, sure enough, and this thing is in charge.\"\n\nHe groaned, and the figure turned its head, showing a pair of little gold rings half hidden in curly black hair. \"Aha! You feel some pretty well now'?\" it said. \"Lie still so: we trim better.\"\n\nWith a swift jerk he sculled the flickering boat-head on to a foamless sea that lifted her twenty full feet, only to slide her into a glassy pit beyond. But this mountain-climbing did not interrupt blue-jersey's talk. \"Fine good job, I say, that I catch you. Eh, wha-at? Better good job, I say, your boat not catch me. How you come to fall out?\"\n\n\"I was sick,\" said Harvey; \"sick, and couldn't help it.\"\n\n\"Just in time I blow my horn, and your boat she yaw a little. Then I see you come all down. Eh, wha-at? I think you are cut into baits by the screw, but you dreeft--dreeft to me, and I make a big fish of you. So you shall not die this time.\"\n\n\"Where am I?\" said Harvey, who could not see that life was particularly safe where he lay.\n\n\"You are with me in the dory--Manuel my name, and I come from schooner 'We're Here' of Gloucester. I live to Gloucester. By-and-by we get supper. Eh, wha-at?\"\n\nHe seemed to have two pairs of hands and a head of cast-iron, for, not content with blowing through a big conch-shell, he must needs stand up to it, swaying with the sway of the flat-bottomed dory, and send a grinding, thuttering shriek through the fog. How long this entertainment lasted, Harvey could not remember, for he lay back terrified at the sight of the smoking swells. He fancied he heard a gun and a horn and shouting. Something bigger than the dory, but quite as lively, loomed alongside. Several voices talked at once; he was dropped into a dark, heaving hole, where men in oilskins gave him a hot drink and took off his clothes, and he fell asleep.",
    "\"Hi!\" shouted Manuel, stooping to the fish, and bringing one up with a finger under its gill and a finger in its eye. He laid it on the edge of the pen; the knife-blade glimmered with a sound of tearing, and the fish, slit from throat to vent, with a nick on either side of the neck, dropped at Long Jack's feet.\n\n\"Hi!\" said Long Jack, with a scoop of his mittened hand. The cod's liver dropped in the basket. Another wrench and scoop sent the head and offal flying, and the empty fish slid across to Uncle Salters, who snorted fiercely. There was another sound of tearing, the backbone flew over the bulwarks, and the fish, headless, gutted, and open, splashed in the tub, sending the salt water into Harvey's astonished mouth. After the first yell, the men were silent. The cod moved along as though they were alive, and long ere Harvey had ceased wondering at the miraculous dexterity of it all, his tub was full.\n\n\"Pitch!\" grunted Uncle Salters, without turning his head, and Harvey pitched the fish by twos and threes down the hatch.\n\n\"Hi! Pitch 'em bunchy,\" shouted Dan. \"Don't scatter! Uncle Salters is the best splitter in the fleet. Watch him mind his book!\"\n\nIndeed, it looked a little as though the round uncle were cutting magazine pages against time. Manuel's body, cramped over from the hips, stayed like a statue; but his long arms grabbed the fish without ceasing. Little Penn toiled valiantly, but it was easy to see he was weak. Once or twice Manuel found time to help him without breaking the chain of supplies, and once Manuel howled because he had caught his finger in a Frenchman's hook. These hooks are made of soft metal, to be rebent after use; but the cod very often get away with them and are hooked again elsewhere; and that is one of the many reasons why the Gloucester boats despise the Frenchmen.\n\n\nDown below, the rasping sound of rough salt rubbed on rough flesh sounded like the whirring of a grindstone--a steady undertune to the \"click-nick\" of the knives in the pen; the wrench and schloop of torn heads, dropped liver, and flying offal; the \"caraaah\" of Uncle Salters's knife scooping away backbones; and the flap of wet, opened bodies falling into the tub.\n\n\nAt the end of an hour Harvey would have given the world to rest; for fresh, wet cod weigh more than you would think, and his back ached with the steady pitching. But he felt for the first time in his life that he was one of a working gang of men, took pride in the thought, and held on sullenly.\n\n\"Knife oh!\" shouted Uncle Salters, at last. Penn doubled up, gasping among the fish, Manuel bowed back and forth to supple himself, and Long Jack leaned over the bulwarks. The cook appeared, noiseless as a black shadow, collected a mass of backbones and heads, and retreated.\n\n\"Blood-ends for breakfast an' head-chowder,\" said Long Jack, smacking his lips.\n\n\"Knife oh!\" repeated Uncle Salters, waving the flat, curved splitter's weapon.\n\n\"Look by your foot, Harve,\" cried Dan, below.\n\nHarvey saw half a dozen knives stuck in a cleat in the hatch combing. He dealt these around, taking over the dulled ones.\n\n\"Water!\" said Disko Troop.\n\n\"Scuttle-butt's for'ard, an' the dipper's alongside. Hurry, Harve,\" said Dan.\n\nHe was back in a minute with a big dipperful of stale brown water which tasted like nectar, and loosed the jaws of Disko and Tom Platt.\n\n\"These are cod,\" said Disko. \"They ain't Damarskus figs, Tom Platt, nor yet silver bars. I've told you that every single time sence we've sailed together.\"\n\n\"A matter o' seven seasons,\" returned Tom Platt, coolly. \"Good stowin's good stowin' all the same, an' there's a right an' a wrong way o' stowin' ballast even. If you'd ever seen four hundred ton o' iron set into the--\"\n\n\"Hi!\" With a yell from Manuel the work began again, and never stopped till the pen was empty. The instant the last fish was down, Disko Troop rolled aft to the cabin with his brother; Manuel and Long Jack went forward; Tom Platt only waited long enough to slide home the hatch ere he too disappeared. In half a minute Harvey heard deep snores in the cabin, and he was staring blankly at Dan and Penn.\n\n\"I did a little better that time, Danny,\" said Penn, whose eyelids were heavy with sleep. \"But I think it is my duty to help clean.\"\n\n\"'Wouldn't hev your conscience fer a thousand quintal,\" said Dan. \"Turn in, Penn. You've no call to do boy's work. Draw a bucket, Harvey. Oh, Penn, dump these in the gurry-butt 'fore you sleep. Kin you keep awake that long?\"\n\nPenn took up the heavy basket of fish-livers, emptied them into a cask with a hinged top lashed by the fo'c'sle; then he too dropped out of sight in the cabin.\n\n\"Boys clean up after dressin' down, an' first watch in ca'am weather is boy's watch on the 'We're Here'.\" Dan sluiced the pen energetically, unshipped the table, set it up to dry in the moonlight, ran the red knife-blades through a wad of oakum, and began to sharpen them on a tiny grindstone, as Harvey threw offal and backbones overboard under his direction.\n\n\nAt the first splash a silvery-white ghost rose bolt upright from the oily water and sighed a weird whistling sigh. Harvey started back with a shout, but Dan only laughed. \"Grampus,\" said he. \"Beggin' fer fish-heads. They up-eend thet way when they're hungry. Breath on him like the doleful tombs, hain't he?\" A horrible stench of decayed fish filled the air as the pillar of white sank, and the water bubbled oilily. \"Hain't ye never seen a grampus up-eend before? You'll see 'em by hundreds 'fore ye're through. Say, it's good to hev a boy aboard again. Otto was too old, an' a Dutchy at that. Him an' me we fought consid'ble. 'Wouldn't ha' keered fer thet ef he'd hed a Christian tongue in his head. Sleepy?\"\n\n\"Dead sleepy,\" said Harvey, nodding forward.\n\n\"'Mustn't sleep on watch. Rouse up an' see ef our anchor-light's bright an' shinin'. You're on watch now, Harve.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! What's to hurt us? Bright's day. Sn-orrr!\n\n\"Jest when things happen, dad says. Fine weather's good sleepin', an' 'fore you know, mebbe, you're cut in two by a liner, an' seventeen brass-bound officers, all gen'elmen, lift their hand to it that your lights was aout an' there was a thick fog. Harve, I've kinder took to you, but ef you nod onct more I'll lay into you with a rope's end.\"\n\nThe moon, who sees many strange things on the Banks, looked down on a slim youth in knickerbockers and a red jersey, staggering around the cluttered decks of a seventy-ton schooner, while behind him, waving a knotted rope, walked, after the manner of an executioner, a boy who yawned and nodded between the blows he dealt.\n\n\nThe lashed wheel groaned and kicked softly, the riding-sail slatted a little in the shifts of the light wind, the windlass creaked, and the miserable procession continued. Harvey expostulated, threatened, whimpered, and at last wept outright, while Dan, the words clotting on his tongue, spoke of the beauty of watchfulness, and slashed away with the rope's end, punishing the dories as often as he hit Harvey. At last the clock in the cabin struck ten, and upon the tenth stroke little Penn crept on deck. He found two boys in two tumbled heaps side by side on the main-hatch, so deeply asleep that he actually rolled them to their berths.",
    "\"They ain't, though. That yaller, dirty packet with her bowsprit steeved that way, she's the 'Hope of Prague'. Nick Brady's her skipper, the meanest man on the Banks. We'll tell him so when we strike the Main Ledge. 'Way off yander's the 'Day's Eye'. The two Jeraulds own her. She's from Harwich; fastish, too, an' hez good luck; but dad he'd find fish in a graveyard. Them other three, side along, they're the 'Margie Smith', 'Rose', and 'Edith S. Walen', all frum home. 'Guess we'll see the 'Abbie M. Deering' to-morrer, dad, won't we? They're all slippin' over from the shoal o' 'Queereau.\"\n\n\"You won't see many boats to-morrow, Danny.\" When Troop called his son Danny, it was a sign that the old man was pleased. \"Boys, we're too crowded,\" he went on, addressing the crew as they clambered inboard. \"We'll leave 'em to bait big an' catch small.\" He looked at the catch in the pen, and it was curious to see how little and level the fish ran. Save for Harvey's halibut, there was nothing over fifteen pounds on deck.\n\n\"I'm waitin' on the weather,\" he added.\n\n\"Ye'll have to make it yourself, Disko, for there's no sign I can see,\" said Long Jack, sweeping the clear horizon.\n\n\nAnd yet, half an hour later, as they were dressing-down, the Bank fog dropped on them, \"between fish and fish,\" as they say. It drove steadily and in wreaths, curling and smoking along the colourless water. The men stopped dressing-down without a word. Long Jack and Uncle Salters slipped the windlass-brakes into their sockets, and began to heave up the anchor, the windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable strained on the barrel. Manuel and Tom Platt gave a hand at the last. The anchor came up with a sob, and the riding-sail bellied as Troop steadied her at the wheel. \"Up jib and foresail,\" said he.\n\n\"Slip 'em in the smother,\" shouted Long Jack, making fast the jib-sheet, while the others raised the clacking, rattling rings of the foresail; and the fore-boom creaked as the \"We're Here\" looked up into the wind and dived off into blank, whirling white.\n\n\"There's wind behind this fog,\" said Troop.\n\nIt was all wonderful beyond words to Harvey; and the most wonderful part was that he heard no orders except an occasional grunt from Troop, ending with, \"That's good, my son!\"\n\n\"'Never seen anchor weighed before?\" said Tom Platt, to Harvey gaping at the damp canvas of the foresail.\n\n\"No. Where are we going?\"\n\n\"Fish and make berth, as you'll find out 'fore you've bin a week aboard. It's all new to you, but we never know what may come to us. Now, take me--Tom Platt--I'd never ha' thought--\"\n\n\"It's better than fourteen dollars a month an' a bullet in your belly,\" said Troop, from the wheel. \"Ease your jumbo a grind.\"\n\n\"Dollars an' cents better,\" returned the man-o'-war's man, doing something to a big jib with a wooden spar tied to it. \"But we didn't think o' that when we manned the windlass-brakes on the 'Miss Jim Buck',[1] outside Beaufort Harbor, with Fort Macon heavin' hot shot at our stern, an' a livin' gale atop of all. Where was you then, Disko?\"\n\n\"Jest here, or hereabouts,\" Disko replied, \"earnin' my bread on the deep waters, and dodgin' Reb privateers. 'Sorry I can't accommodate you with red-hot shot, Tom Platt; but I guess we'll come aout all right on wind 'fore we see Eastern Point.\"\n\nThere was an incessant slapping and chatter at the bows now, varied by a solid thud and a little spout of spray that clattered down on the fo'c'sle. The rigging dripped clammy drops, and the men lounged along the lee of the house--all save Uncle Salters, who sat stiffly on the main-hatch nursing his stung hands.\n\n\"'Guess she'd carry stays'l,\" said Disko, rolling one eye at his brother.\n\n\"Guess she wouldn't to any sorter profit. What's the sense o' wastin' canvas?\" the farmer-sailor replied.\n\n\nThe wheel twitched almost imperceptibly in Disko's hands. A few seconds later a hissing wave-top slashed diagonally across the boat, smote Uncle Salters between the shoulders, and drenched him from head to foot. He rose sputtering, and went forward, only to catch another. \"See dad chase him, all around the deck,\" said Dan. \"Uncle Salters he thinks his quarter-share's our canvas. Dad's put this duckin' act up on him two trips runnin'. Hi! That found him where he feeds.\" Uncle Salters had taken refuge by the foremast, but a wave slapped him over the knees. Disko's face was as blank as the circle of the wheel.\n\n\"'Guess she'd lie easier under stays'l, Salters,\" said Disko, as though he had seen nothing.\n\n\"Set your old kite, then,\" roared the victim, through a cloud of spray; \"only don't lay it to me if anything happens. Penn, you go below right off an' git your coffee. You ought to hev more sense than to bum araound on deck this weather.\"\n\n\"Now they'll swill coffee an' play checkers till the cows come home,\" said Dan, as Uncle Salters hustled Penn into the fore-cabin. \"'Looks to me like's if we'd all be doin' so fer a spell. There's nothin' in creation deader-limpsey-idler'n a Banker when she ain't on fish.\"",
    "Next day they fell in with more sails, all circling slowly from the east northerly towards the west. But just when they expected to make the shoals by the Virgin the fog shut down, and they anchored, surrounded by the tinklings of invisible bells. There was not much fishing, but occasionally dory met dory in the fog and exchanged news.\n\nThat night, a little before dawn, Dan and Harvey, who had been sleeping most of the day, tumbled out to \"hook\" fried pies. There was no reason why they should not have taken them openly; but they tasted better so, and it made the cook angry. The heat and smell below drove them on deck with their plunder, and they found Disko at the bell, which he handed over to Harvey.\n\"Keep her goin',\" said he. \"I mistrust I hear somethin'. Ef it's anything, I'm best where I am so's to get at things.\"\n\nIt was a forlorn little jingle; the thick air seemed to pinch it off; and in the pauses Harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liner's siren, and he knew enough of the Banks to know what that meant. It came to him, with horrible distinctness, how a boy in a cherry-coloured jersey--he despised fancy blazers now with all a fisherman's contempt--how an ignorant, rowdy boy had once said it would be \"great\" if a steamer ran down a fishing-boat. That boy had a state-room with a hot and cold bath, and spent ten minutes each morning picking over a gilt-edged bill of fare. And that same boy--no, his very much older brother--was up at four of the dim dawn in streaming, crackling oilskins, hammering, literally for the dear life, on a bell smaller than the steward's breakfast-bell, while somewhere close at hand a thirty-foot steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour! The bitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry, upholstered cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat before breakfast. So Harvey rang the bell.\n\n\"Yes, they slow daown one turn o' their blame propeller,\" said Dan, applying himself to Manuel's conch, \"fer to keep inside the law, an' that's consolin' when we're all at the bottom. Hark to her! She's a humper!\"\n\n\"Aoooo--whoooo--whupp!\" went the siren. \"Wingle--tingle--tink,\" went the bell. \"Graaa--ouch!\" went the conch, while sea and sky were all milled up in milky fog. Then Harvey felt that he was near a moving body, and found himself looking up and up at the wet edge of a cliff-like bow, leaping, it seemed, directly over the schooner. A jaunty little feather of water curled in front of it, and as it lifted it showed a long ladder of Roman numerals--XV., XVI., XVII., XVIII., and so forth--on a salmon-coloured, gleaming side. It tilted forward and downward with a heart-stilling \"Ssssooo\"; the ladder disappeared; a line of brass-rimmed port-holes flashed past; a jet of Steam puffed in Harvey's helplessly uplifted hands; a spout of hot water roared along the rail of the \"We're Here\", and the little schooner staggered and shook in a rush of screw-torn water, as a liner's stern vanished in the fog. Harvey got ready to faint or be sick, or both, when he heard a crack like a trunk thrown on a sidewalk, and, all small in his ear, a far-away telephone voice drawling: \"Heave to! You've sunk us!\"\n\n\"Is it us?\" he gasped.\n\n\"No! Boat out yonder. Ring! We're goin' to look,\" said Dan, running out a dory.\n\nIn half a minute all except Harvey, Penn, and the cook were overside and away. Presently a schooner's stump-foremast, snapped clean across, drifted past the bows. Then an empty green dory came by, knocking on the \"We're Here's\" side, as though she wished to be taken in. Then followed something, face down, in a blue jersey, but it was not the whole of a man. Penn changed colour and caught his breath with a click. Harvey pounded despairingly at the bell, for he feared they might be sunk at any minute, and he jumped at Dan's hail as the crew came back.\n\n\"The Jennie Cushman,\" said Dan, hysterically, \"cut clean in half--graound up an' trompled on at that! Not a quarter of a mile away. Dad's got the old man. There ain't any one else, and--there was his son, too. Oh, Harve, Harve, I can't stand it! I've seen--\" He dropped his head on his arms and sobbed while the others dragged a grey-headed man aboard.\n\n\"What did you pick me up for?\" the stranger groaned. \"Disko, what did you pick me up for?\"\n\nDisko dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder, for the man's eyes were wild and his lips trembled as he stared at the silent crew. Then up and spoke Pennsylvania Pratt, who was also Haskins or Rich or McVitty when Uncle Salters forgot; and his face was changed on him from the face of a fool to the countenance of an old, wise man, and he said in a strong voice: \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord! I was--I am a minister of the Gospel. Leave him to me.\"",
    "\"Oh, you be, be you?\" said the man. \"Then pray my son back to me! Pray back a nine-thousand-dollar boat an' a thousand quintal of fish. If you'd left me alone my widow could ha' gone on to the Provident an' worked fer her board, an' never known--an' never known. Now I'll hev to tell her.\"\n\n\"There ain't nothin' to say,\" said Disko. \"Better lie down a piece, Jason Olley.\"\n\nWhen a man has lost his only son, his summer's work, and his means of livelihood, in thirty counted seconds, it is hard to give consolation.\n\n\"All Gloucester men, wasn't they,\" said Tom Platt, fiddling helplessly with a dory-becket.\n\n\"Oh, that don't make no odds,\" said Jason, wringing the wet from his beard. \"I'll be rowin' summer boarders araound East Gloucester this fall.\" He rolled heavily to the rail, singing.\n\"Happy birds that sing and fly Round thine altars, O Most High!\"\n\n\"Come with me. Come below!\" said Penn, as though he had a right to give orders. Their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute.\n\n\"I dunno who you be, but I'll come,\" said Jason, submissively. \"Mebbe I'll get back some o' the--some o' the--nine thousand dollars.\" Penn led him into the cabin and slid the door behind.\n\n\"That ain't Penn,\" cried Uncle Salters. \"It's Jacob Boiler, an'--he's remembered Johnstown! I never seed such eyes in any livin' man's head. What's to do naow? What'll I do naow?\"\n\nThey could hear Penn's voice and Jason's together. Then Penn's went on alone, and Salters slipped off his hat, for Penn was praying. Presently the little man came up the steps, huge drops of sweat on his face, and looked at the crew. Dan was still sobbing by the wheel.\n\n\"He don't know us,\" Salters groaned. \"It's all to do over again, checkers and everything--an' what'll he say to me?\"\n\nPenn spoke; they could hear that it was to strangers. \"I have prayed,\" said he. \"Our people believe in prayer. I have prayed for the life of this man's son. Mine were drowned before my eyes--she and my eldest and--the others. Shall a man be more wise than his Maker? I prayed never for their lives, but I have prayed for this man's son, and he will surely be sent him.\"\n\nSalters looked pleadingly at Penn to see if he remembered.\n\n\"How long have I been mad?\" Penn asked suddenly. His mouth was twitching.\n\n\"Pshaw, Penn! You weren't never mad,\" Salters began. \"Only a little distracted like.\"\n\n\"I saw the houses strike the bridge before the fires broke out. I do not remember any more. How long ago is that?\"\n\n\"I can't stand it! I can't stand it!\" cried Dan, and Harvey whimpered in sympathy.\n\n\"Abaout five year,\" said Disko, in a shaking voice.\n\n\"Then I have been a charge on some one for every day of that time. Who was the man?\"\n\nDisko pointed to Salters.\n\n\"Ye hain't--ye hain't!\" cried the sea-farmer, twisting his hands together. \"Ye've more'n earned your keep twice-told; an' there's money owin' you, Penn, besides ha'af o' my quarter-share in the boat, which is yours fer value received.\"\n\n\"You are good men. I can see that in your faces. But--\"\n\n\"Mother av Mercy,\" whispered Long Jack, \"an' he's been wid us all these trips! He's clean bewitched.\"\n\nA schooner's bell struck up alongside, and a voice hailed through the fog: \"O Disko! 'Heard abaout the Jennie Cushman?\"\n\n\"They have found his son,\" cried Penn. \"Stand you still and see the salvation of the Lord!\"\n\n\"Got Jason aboard here,\" Disko answered, but his voice quavered. \"There--warn't any one else?\"\n\n\"We've f'und one, though. 'Run acrost him snarled up in a mess o' lumber thet might ha' bin a fo'c'sle. His head's cut some.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\nThe \"We're Heres'\" heart-beats answered one another.\n\n\"Guess it's young Olley,\" the voice drawled.\n\nPenn raised his hands and said something in German. Harvey could have sworn that a bright sun was shining upon his lifted face; but the drawl went on: \"Sa-ay! You fellers guyed us consid'rable t'other night.\"",
    "The \"We're Here\" was racing neck and neck for her last few loads against the \"Parry Norman\"; and so close was the struggle that the Fleet took sides and betted tobacco. All hands worked at the lines or dressing-down till they fell asleep where they stood--beginning before dawn and ending when it was too dark to see. They even used the cook as pitcher, and turned Harvey into the hold to pass salt, while Dan helped to dress down. Luckily a \"Parry Norman\" man sprained his ankle falling down the fo'c'sle, and the \"We're Heres\" gained. Harvey could not see how one more fish could be crammed into her, but Disko and Tom Platt stowed and stowed, and planked the mass down with big stones from the ballast, and there was always \"jest another day's work.\" Disko did not tell them when all the salt was wetted. He rolled to the lazarette aft the cabin and began hauling out the big mainsail. This was at ten in the morning. The riding-sail was down and the main- and top-sail were up by noon, and dories came alongside with letters for home, envying their good fortune. At last she cleared decks, hoisted her flag,--as is the right of the first boat off the Banks,--up-anchored, and began to move. Disko pretended that he wished to accommodate folk who had not sent in their mail, and so worked her gracefully in and out among the schooners. In reality, that was his little triumphant procession, and for the fifth year running it showed what kind of mariner he was. Dan's accordion and Tom Platt's fiddle supplied the music of the magic verse you must not sing till all the salt is wet:\n\n  \"Hih! Yih! Yoho!\n  Send your letters raound!\n  All our salt is wetted, an' the anchor's off the graound!\n  Bend, oh, bend your mains'l!, we're back to Yankeeland--\n  With fifteen hunder' quintal,\n  An' fifteen hunder' quintal,\n  'Teen hunder' toppin' quintal,\n  'Twix' old 'Queereau an' Grand.\"\n\nThe last letters pitched on deck wrapped round pieces of coal, and the Gloucester men shouted messages to their wives and womenfolk and owners, while the \"We're Here\" finished the musical ride through the Fleet, her head-sails quivering like a man's hand when he raises it to say good-bye.\n\nHarvey very soon discovered that the \"We're Here\", with her riding-sail, strolling from berth to berth, and the \"We're Here\" headed west by south under home canvas, were two very different boats. There was a bite and kick to the wheel even in \"boy's\" weather; he could feel the dead weight in the hold flung forward mightily across the surges, and the streaming line of bubbles overside made his eyes dizzy.\n\nDisko kept them busy fiddling with the sails; and when those were flattened like a racing yacht's, Dan had to wait on the big topsail, which was put over by hand every time she went about. In spare moments they pumped, for the packed fish dripped brine, which does not improve a cargo. But since there was no fishing, Harvey had time to look at the sea from another point of view. The low-sided schooner was naturally on most intimate terms with her surroundings. They saw little of the horizon save when she topped a swell; and usually she was elbowing, fidgeting, and coaxing her steadfast way through grey, grey-blue, or black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam; or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger water-hill. It was as if she said: \"You wouldn't hurt me, surely? I'm only the little 'We're Here'.\" Then she would slide away chuckling softly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle. The dullest of folk cannot see this kind of thing hour after hour through long days without noticing it; and Harvey, being anything but dull, began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wave-tops turning over with a sound of incessant tearing; the hurry of the winds working across open spaces and herding the purple-blue cloud-shadows; the splendid upheaval of the red sunrise; the folding and packing away of the morning mists, wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors; the salty glare and blaze of noon; the kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead, flat square miles; the chilly blackening of everything at the day's end; and the million wrinkles of the sea under the moonlight, when the jib-boom solemnly poked at the low stars, and Harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook.\n\nBut the best fun was when the boys were put on the wheel together, Tom Platt within hail, and she cuddled her lee-rail down to the crashing blue, and kept a little home-made rainbow arching unbroken over her windlass. Then the jaws of the booms whined against the masts, and the sheets creaked, and the sails filled with roaring; and when she slid into a hollow she trampled like a woman tripped in her own silk dress, and came out, her jib wet half-way up, yearning and peering for the tall twin-lights of Thatcher's Island.\n\nThey left the cold grey of the Bank sea, saw the lumber-ships making for Quebec by the Straits of St. Lawrence, with the Jersey salt-brigs from Spain and Sicily; found a friendly northeaster off Artimon Bank that drove them within view of the East light of Sable Island,--a sight Disko did not linger over,--and stayed with them past Western and Le Have, to the northern fringe of George's. From there they picked up the deeper water, and let her go merrily.\n\n\"Hattie's pulling on the string,\" Dan confided to Harvey. \"Hattie an' ma. Next Sunday you'll be hirin' a boy to throw water on the windows to make ye go to sleep. 'Guess you'll keep with us till your folks come. Do you know the best of gettin' ashore again?\"\n\n\"Hot bath?\" said Harvey. His eyebrows were all white with dried spray.\n\n\"That's good, but a night-shirt's better. I've been dreamin' o' night-shirts ever since we bent our mainsail. Ye can wiggle your toes then. Ma'll hev a new one fer me, all washed soft. It's home, Harve. It's home! Ye can sense it in the air. We're runnin' into the aidge of a hot wave naow, an' I can smell the bayberries. Wonder if we'll get in fer supper. Port a trifle.\"\n\nThe hesitating sails flapped and lurched in the close air as the deep smoothed out, blue and oily, round them. When they whistled for a wind only the rain came in spiky rods, bubbling and drumming, and behind the rain the thunder and the lightning of mid-August. They lay on the deck with bare feet and arms, telling one another what they would order at their first meal ashore; for now the land was in plain sight. A Gloucester swordfish-boat drifted alongside, a man in the little pulpit on the bowsprit flourishing his harpoon, his bare head plastered down with the wet. \"And all's well!\" he sang cheerily, as though he were watch on a big liner. \"Wouverman's waiting fer you, Disko. What's the news o' the Fleet?\"\nDisko shouted it and passed on, while the wild summer storm pounded overhead and the lightning flickered along the capes from four different quarters at once. It gave the low circle of hills round Gloucester Harbour, Ten Pound Island, the fish-sheds, with the broken line of house-roofs, and each spar and buoy on the water, in blinding photographs that came and went a dozen times to the minute as the \"We're Here\" crawled in on half-flood, and the whistling-buoy moaned and mourned behind her.",
    "\"I know it; but he thought I was crazy. I'm afraid I called him a thief because I couldn't find the bills in my pocket.\"\n\"A sailor found them by the flagstaff that--that night,\" sobbed Mrs. Cheyne.\n\"That explains it, then. I don't blame Troop any. I just said I wouldn't work--on a Banker, too--and of course he hit me on the nose, and oh! I bled like a stuck hog.\"\n\"My poor darling! They must have abused you horribly.\"\n\"Dunno quite. Well, after that, I saw a light.\"\nCheyne slapped his leg and chuckled. This was going to be a boy after his own hungry heart. He had never seen precisely that twinkle in Harvey's eye before.\n\"And the old man gave me ten and a half a month; he's paid me half now; and I took hold with Dan and pitched right in. I can't do a man's work yet. But I can handle a dory 'most as well as Dan, and I don't get rattled in a fog--much; and I can take my trick in light winds--that's steering, dear--and I can 'most bait up a trawl, and I know my ropes, of course; and I can pitch fish till the cows come home, and I'm great on old Josephus, and I'll show you how I can clear coffee with a piece of fish-skin, and--I think I'll have another cup, please. Say, you've no notion what a heap of work there is in ten and a half a month!\"\n\"I began with eight and a half, my son,\" said Cheyne.\n\"'That so? You never told me, sir.\"\n\"You never asked, Harve. I'll tell you about it some day, if you care to listen. Try a stuffed olive.\"\n\"Troop says the most interesting thing in the world is to find out how the next man gets his vittles. It's great to have a trimmed-up meal again. We were well fed, though. Best mug on the Banks. Disko fed us first-class. He's a great man. And Dan--that's his son--Dan's my partner. And there's Uncle Salters and his manures, an' he reads Josephus. He's sure I'm crazy yet. And there's poor little Penn, and he is crazy. You mustn't talk to him about Johnstown, because--And, oh, you must know Tom Platt and Long Jack and Manuel. Manuel saved my life. I'm sorry he's a Portugee. He can't talk much, but he's an everlasting musician. He found me struck adrift and drifting, and hauled me in.\"\n\"I wonder your nervous system isn't completely wrecked,\" said Mrs. Cheyne.\n\"What for, mama? I worked like a horse and I ate like a hog and I slept like a dead man.\"\nThat was too much for Mrs. Cheyne, who began to think of her visions of a corpse rocking on the salty seas. She went to her state-room, and Harvey curled up beside his father, explaining his indebtedness.\n\"You can depend upon me to do everything I can for the crowd, Harve. They seem to be good men on your showing.\"\n\"Best in the Fleet, sir. Ask at Gloucester,\" said Harvey. \"But Disko believes still he's cured me of being crazy. Dan's the only one I've let on to about you, and our private cars and all the rest of it, and I'm not quite sure Dan believes. I want to paralyse 'em to-morrow. Say, can't they run the 'Constance' over to Gloucester? Mama don't look fit to be moved, anyway, and we're bound to finish cleaning out by to-morrow. Wouverman takes our fish. You see, we're first off the Banks this season, and it's four twenty-five a quintal. We held out till he paid it. They want it quick.\"\n\"You mean you'll have to work to-morrow, then?\"\n\"I told Troop I would. I'm on the scales. I've brought the tallies with me.\" He looked at the greasy notebook with an air of importance that made his father choke. \"There isn't but three--no--two ninety-four or five quintal more by my reckoning.\"\n\"Hire a substitute,\" suggested Cheyne, to see what Harvey would say.\n\"Can't, sir. I'm tally-man for the schooner. Troop says I've a better head for figures than Dan. Troop's a mighty just man.\"\n\"Well, suppose I don't move the 'Constance' to-night, how'll you fix it?\"\nHarvey looked at the clock, which marked twenty past eleven.\n\"Then I'll sleep here till three and catch the four o'clock freight. They let us men from the Fleet ride free, as a rule.\"\n\"That's a notion. But I think we can get the 'Constance' around about as soon as your men's freight. Better go to bed now.\"\nHarvey spread himself on the sofa, kicked off his boots, and was asleep before his father could shade the electrics. Cheyne sat watching the young face under the shadow of the arm thrown over the forehead, and among many things that occurred to him was the notion that he might perhaps have been neglectful as a father.\n\"One never knows when one's taking one's biggest risks,\" he said. \"It might have been worse than drowning; but I don't think it has--I don't think it has. If it hasn't, I haven't enough to pay Troop, that's all; and I don't think it has.\"\nMorning brought a fresh sea breeze through the windows, the \"Constance\" was side-tracked among freight-cars at Gloucester, and Harvey had gone to his business.\n\"Then he'll fall overboard again and be drowned,\" the mother said bitterly.\n\"We'll go and look, ready to throw him a rope in case. You've never seen him working for his bread,\" said the father.\n\"What nonsense! As if any one expected--\"\n\"Well, the man that hired him did. He's about right, too.\"\nThey went down between the stores full of fishermen's oilskins to Wouverman's wharf, where the \"We're Here\" rode high, her Bank flag still flying, all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light. Disko stood by the main hatch superintending Manuel, Penn, and Uncle Salters at the tackle. Dan was swinging the loaded baskets inboard as Long Jack and Tom Platt filled them, and Harvey, with a notebook, represented the skipper's interests before the clerk of the scales on the salt-sprinkled wharf-edge.\n\"Ready!\" cried the voices below. \"Haul!\" cried Disko. \"Hi!\" said Manuel. \"Here!\" said Dan, swinging the basket. Then they heard Harvey's voice, clear and fresh, checking the weights.\nThe last of the fish had been whipped out, and Harvey leaped from the string-piece six feet to a ratline, as the shortest way to hand Disko the tally, shouting, \"Two ninety-seven, and an empty hold!\"\n\"What's total, Harve?\" said Disko.\n\"Eight sixty-five. Three thousand six hundred and seventy-six dollars and a quarter. 'Wish I'd share as well as wage.\"\n\"Well, I won't go so far as to say you hevn't deserved it, Harve. Don't you want to slip up to Wouverman's office and take him our tallies?\"",
    "In the \"We're Here's\" cabin the fathers took stock of each other behind their cigars. Cheyne knew well enough when he dealt with a man to whom he could not offer money; equally well he knew that no money could pay for what Disko had done. He kept his own counsel and waited for an opening.\n\n\"I hevn't done anything to your boy or fer your boy excep' make him work a piece an' learn him how to handle the hog-yoke,\" said Disko. \"He has twice my boy's head for figgers.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" Cheyne answered casually, \"what d'you calculate to make of your boy?\"\n\nDisko removed his cigar and waved it comprehensively round the cabin. \"Dan's jest plain boy, an' he don't allow me to do any of his thinkin'. He'll hev this able little packet when I'm laid by. He ain't noways anxious to quit the business. I know that.\"\n\n\"Mmm! 'Ever been West, Mr. Troop?\"\n\n\"Bin's fer ez Noo York once in a boat. I've no use for railroads. No more hez Dan. Salt water's good enough fer the Troops. I've been 'most everywhere--in the nat'ral way, o' course.\"\n\n\"I can give him all the salt water he's likely to need--till he's a skipper.\"\n\n\"Haow's that? I thought you wuz a kinder railroad king. Harve told me so when--I was mistook in my jedgments.\"\n\n\"We're all apt to be mistaken. I fancied perhaps you might know I own a line of tea-clippers--San Francisco to Yokohama--six of 'em--iron-built, about seventeen hundred and eighty tons apiece.\"\n\n\"Blame that boy! He never told. I'd ha' listened to that, instid o' his truck abaout railroads an' pony-carriages.\"\n\n\"He didn't know.\"\n\n\"'Little thing like that slipped his mind, I guess.\"\n\n\"No, I only capt--took hold of the 'Blue M.' freighters--Morgan and McQuade's old line--this summer.\"\n\nDisko collapsed where he sat, beside the stove.\n\n\"Great Caesar Almighty! I mistrust I've bin fooled from one end to the other. Why, Phil Airheart he went from this very town six year back--no, seven--an' he's mate on the San Jos\u00e9 now--twenty-six days was her time out. His sister she's livin' here yet, an' she reads his letters to my woman. An' you own the 'Blue M.' freighters?\"\n\nCheyne nodded.\n\n\"If I'd known that I'd ha' jerked the \"We're Here\" back to port all standin', on the word.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that wouldn't have been so good for Harvey.\"\n\n\"Ef I'd only known! Ef he'd only said about the cussed Line, I'd ha' understood! I'll never stand on my own jedgments again--never. They're well-found packets, Phil Airheart he says so.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to have a recommend from that quarter. Airheart's skipper of the San Jos\u00e9 now. What I was getting at is to know whether you'd lend me Dan for a year or two, and we'll see if we can't make a mate of him. Would you trust him to Airheart?\"\n\n\"It's a resk taking a raw boy--\"\n\n\"I know a man who did more for me.\"\n\n\"That's diff'runt. Look at here naow, I ain't recommendin' Dan special because he's my own flesh an' blood. I know Bank ways ain't clipper ways, but he hain't much to learn. Steer he can--no boy better, ef I say it--an' the rest's in our blood an' get; but I could wish he warn't so cussed weak on navigation.\"\n\n\"Airheart will attend to that. He'll ship as a boy for a voyage or two, and then we can put him in the way of doing better. Suppose you take him in hand this winter, and I'll send for him early in the spring. I know the Pacific's a long ways off--\"\n\n\"Pshaw! We Troops, livin' an' dead, are all around the earth an' the seas thereof.\"\n\n\"But I want you to understand--and I mean this--any time you think you'd like to see him, tell me, and I'll attend to the transportation. 'Twon't cost you a cent.\"\n\n\"Ef you'll walk a piece with me, we'll go to my house an' talk this to my woman. I've bin so crazy mistook in all my jedgments, it don't seem to me this was like to be real.\"\n\nThey went over to Troop's eighteen-hundred-dollar, blue-trimmed white house, with a retired dory full of nasturtiums in the front yard and a shuttered parlor which was a museum of oversea plunder. There sat a large woman, silent and grave, with the dim eyes of those who look long to sea for the return of their beloved. Cheyne addressed himself to her, and she gave consent wearily.\n\n\"We lose one hundred a year from Gloucester only, Mr. Cheyne,\" she said--\"one hundred boys an' men; and I've come so's to hate the sea as if 'twuz alive an' listenin'. God never made it fer humans to anchor on. These packets o' yours they go straight out, I take it, and straight home again?\"\n\n\"As straight as the winds let 'em, and I give a bonus for record passages. Tea don't improve by being at sea.\"\n\n\"When he wuz little he used to play at keeping store, an' I had hopes he might follow that up. But soon's he could paddle a dory I knew that were goin' to be denied me.\"\n\n\"They're square-riggers, mother; iron-built an' well found. Remember what Phil's sister reads you when she gits his letters.\"\n\n\"I've never known as Phil told lies, but he's too venturesome (like most of 'em that use the sea). Ef Dan sees fit, Mr. Cheyne, he can go--fer all o' me.\"\n\n\"She jest despises the ocean,\" Disko explained, \"an' I--I dunno haow to act polite, I guess, er I'd thank you better.\"",
    "The widows--they were nearly all of that season's making--braced themselves rigidly like people going to be shot in cold blood, for they knew what was coming. The summer-boarder girls in pink and blue shirt-waists stopped tittering over Captain Edwardes's wonderful poem, and looked back to see why all was silent. The fishermen pressed forward as that town official who had talked with Cheyne bobbed up on the platform and began to read the year's list of losses, dividing them into months. Last September's casualties were mostly single men and strangers, but his voice rang very loud in the stillness of the hall.\n\n\"September 9th.--Schooner \"Florrie Anderson\" lost, with all aboard, off the Georges. \"Reuben Pitman, master, 50, single, Main Street, City. \"Emil Olsen, 19, single, 329 Hammond Street, City; Denmark. \"Oscar Stanberg, single, 25, Sweden. \"Carl Stanberg, single, 28, Main Street, City. \"Pedro, supposed Madeira, single, Keene's boarding-house, City. \"Joseph Welsh, alias Joseph Wright, 30, St. John's, Newfoundland.\"\n\n\"No--Augusty, Maine,\" a voice cried from the body of the hall.\n\n\"He shipped from St. John's,\" said the reader, looking to see.\n\n\"I know it. He belongs in Augusty. My nevvy.\"\n\nThe reader made a pencilled correction on the margin of the list, and resumed:\n\n\"Same schooner, Charlie Ritchie, Liverpool, Nova Scotia, 33, single. \"Albert May, 267 Rogers Street, City, 27, single. \"September 27th.--Orvin Dollard, 30, married, drowned in dory off Eastern Point.\"\n\nThat shot went home, for one of the widows flinched where she sat, clasping and unclasping her hands. Mrs. Cheyne, who had been listening with wide-opened eyes, threw up her head and choked. Dan's mother, a few seats to the right, saw and heard and quickly moved to her side. The reading went on. By the time they reached the January and February wrecks the shots were falling thick and fast, and the widows drew breath between their teeth.\n\n\"February 14th.--Schooner \"Harry Randolph\" dismasted on the way home from Newfoundland; Asa Musie, married, 32, Main Street, City, lost overboard.\n\n\"February 23d.--Schooner \"Gilbert Hope\"; went astray in dory, Robert Beavon, 29, married, native of Pubnico, Nova Scotia.\"\n\nBut his wife was in the hall. They heard a low cry, as though a little animal had been hit. It was stifled at once, and a girl staggered out of the hall. She had been hoping against hope for months, because some who have gone adrift in dories have been miraculously picked up by deep-sea sailing-ships. Now she had her certainty, and Harvey could see the policeman on the sidewalk hailing a hack for her. \"It's fifty cents to the depot\"--the driver began, but the policeman held up his hand--\"but I'm goin' there anyway. Jump right in. Look at here, Alf; you don't pull me next time my lamps ain't lit. See?\"\n\nThe side-door closed on the patch of bright sunshine, and Harvey's eyes turned again to the reader and his endless list.\n\n\"April 19th.--Schooner \"Mamie Douglas\" lost on the Banks with all hands. \"Edward Canton,\" 43, master, married, City. \"D. Hawkins,\" alias Williams, 34, married, Shelbourne, Nova Scotia. \"G. W. Clay,\" coloured, 28, married, City.\"\n\nAnd so on, and so on. Great lumps were rising in Harvey's throat, and his stomach reminded him of the day when he fell from the liner.\n\n\"May 10th.--Schooner \"We're Here\" [the blood tingled all over him]. Otto Svendson, 20, single, City, lost overboard.\"\n\nOnce more a low, tearing cry from somewhere at the back of the hall.\n\n\"She shouldn't ha' come. She shouldn't ha' come,\" said Long Jack, with a cluck of pity. \"Don't scrowge, Harve,\" grunted Dan. Harvey heard that much, but the rest was all darkness spotted with fiery wheels. Disko leaned forward and spoke to his wife, where she sat with one arm round Mrs. Cheyne, and the other holding down the snatching, catching, ringed hands.\n\n\"Lean your head daown--right daown!\" she whispered. \"It'll go off in a minute.\"\n\n\"I ca-an't! I do-don't! Oh, let me--\" Mrs. Cheyne did not at all know what she said.\n\n\"You must,\" Mrs. Troop repeated. \"Your boy's jest fainted dead away. They do that some when they're gettin' their growth. 'Wish to tend to him? We can git aout this side. Quite quiet. You come right along with me. Psha', my dear, we're both women, I guess. We must tend to aour men-folk. Come!\"\n\nThe \"We're Heres\" promptly went through the crowd as a body-guard, and it was a very white and shaken Harvey that they propped up on a bench in an anteroom.\n\n\"Favours his ma,\" was Mrs. Troop's only comment, as the mother bent over her boy.\n\n\"How d'you suppose he could ever stand it?\" she cried indignantly to Cheyne, who had said nothing at all. \"It was horrible--horrible! We shouldn't have come. It's wrong and wicked! It--it isn't right! Why--why couldn't they put these things in the papers, where they belong? Are you better, darling?\"\n\nThat made Harvey very properly ashamed. \"Oh, I'm all right, I guess,\" he said, struggling to his feet, with a broken giggle. \"Must ha' been something I ate for breakfast.\""

  "Rudyard Kipling -- Kim": [
    "O ye who tread the Narrow Way\nBy Tophet-flare to Judgment Day,\nBe gentle when \u201cthe heathen\u201d pray\n    To Buddha at Kamakura!\n\nHe sat, in defiance of municipal orders, astride the gun Zam Zammah on her brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher\u2014the Wonder House, as the natives call the Lahore Museum. Who hold Zam-Zammah, that \u201cfire-breathing dragon\u201d, hold the Punjab, for the great green-bronze piece is always first of the conqueror\u2019s loot. There was some justification for Kim\u2014he had kicked Lala Dinanath\u2019s boy off the trunnions\u2014since the English held the Punjab and Kim was English. Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white\u2014a poor white of the very poorest. The half-caste woman who looked after him (she smoked opium, and pretended to keep a second-hand furniture shop by the square where the cheap cabs wait) told the missionaries that she was Kim\u2019s mother\u2019s sister; but his mother had been nursemaid in a Colonel\u2019s family and had married Kimball O\u2019Hara, a young colour-sergeant of the Mavericks, an Irish regiment. He afterwards took a post on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, and his Regiment went home without him. The wife died of cholera in Ferozepore, and O\u2019Hara fell to drink and loafing up and down the line with the keen-eyed three-year-old baby. Societies and chaplains, anxious for the child, tried to catch him, but O\u2019Hara drifted away, till he came across the woman who took opium and learned the taste from her, and died as poor whites die in India. His estate at death consisted of three papers\u2014one he called his \u201c_ne varietur_\u201d because those words were written below his signature thereon, and another his \u201cclearance-certificate\u201d. The third was Kim\u2019s birth-certificate. Those things, he was used to say, in his glorious opium-hours, would yet make little Kimball a man. On no account was Kim to part with them, for they belonged to a great piece of magic\u2014such magic as men practised over yonder behind the Museum, in the big blue-and-white Jadoo-Gher\u2014the Magic House, as we name the Masonic Lodge. It would, he said, all come right some day, and Kim\u2019s horn would be exalted between pillars\u2014monstrous pillars\u2014of beauty and strength. The Colonel himself, riding on a horse, at the head of the finest Regiment in the world, would attend to Kim\u2014little Kim that should have been better off than his father. Nine hundred first-class devils, whose God was a Red Bull on a green field, would attend to Kim, if they had not forgotten O\u2019Hara\u2014poor O\u2019Hara that was gang-foreman on the Ferozepore line. Then he would weep bitterly in the broken rush chair on the veranda. So it came about after his death that the woman sewed parchment, paper, and birth-certificate into a leather amulet-case which she strung round Kim\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cAnd some day,\u201d she said, confusedly remembering O\u2019Hara\u2019s prophecies, \u201cthere will come for you a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and\u201d dropping into English\u2014\u201cnine hundred devils.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Kim, \u201cI shall remember. A Red Bull and a Colonel on a horse will come, but first, my father said, will come the two men making ready the ground for these matters. That is how my father said they always did; and it is always so when men work magic.\u201d\n\nIf the woman had sent Kim up to the local Jadoo-Gher with those papers, he would, of course, have been taken over by the Provincial Lodge, and sent to the Masonic Orphanage in the Hills; but what she had heard of magic she distrusted. Kim, too, held views of his own. As he reached the years of indiscretion, he learned to avoid missionaries and white men of serious aspect who asked who he was, and what he did. For Kim did nothing with an immense success. True, he knew the wonderful walled city of Lahore from the Delhi Gate to the outer Fort Ditch; was hand in glove with men who led lives stranger than anything Haroun al Raschid dreamed of; and he lived in a life wild as that of the Arabian Nights, but missionaries and secretaries of charitable societies could not see the beauty of it. His nickname through the wards was \u201cLittle Friend of all the World\u201d; and very often, being lithe and inconspicuous, he executed commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion. It was intrigue,\u2014of course he knew that much, as he had known all evil since he could speak,\u2014but what he loved was the game for its own sake\u2014the stealthy prowl through the dark gullies and lanes, the crawl up a waterpipe, the sights and sounds of the women\u2019s world on the flat roofs, and the headlong flight from housetop to housetop under cover of the hot dark. Then there were holy men, ash-smeared _faquirs_ by their brick shrines under the trees at the riverside, with whom he was quite familiar\u2014greeting them as they returned from begging-tours, and, when no one was by, eating from the same dish. The woman who looked after him insisted with tears that he should wear European clothes\u2014trousers, a shirt and a battered hat. Kim found it easier to slip into Hindu or Mohammedan garb when engaged on certain businesses. One of the young men of fashion\u2014he who was found dead at the bottom of a well on the night of the earthquake\u2014had once given him a complete suit of Hindu kit, the costume of a lowcaste street boy, and Kim stored it in a secret place under some baulks in Nila Ram\u2019s timber-yard, beyond the Punjab High Court, where the fragrant deodar logs lie seasoning after they have driven down the Ravi. When there was business or frolic afoot, Kim would use his properties, returning at dawn to the veranda, all tired out from shouting at the heels of a marriage procession, or yelling at a Hindu festival. Sometimes there was food in the house, more often there was not, and then Kim went out again to eat with his native friends.\n\nAs he drummed his heels against Zam-Zammah he turned now and again from his king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the sweetmeat-seller\u2019s son, to make a rude remark to the native policeman on guard over rows of shoes at the Museum door. The big Punjabi grinned tolerantly: he knew Kim of old. So did the water-carrier, sluicing water on the dry road from his goat-skin bag. So did Jawahir Singh, the Museum carpenter, bent over new packing-cases. So did everybody in sight except the peasants from the country, hurrying up to the Wonder House to view the things that men made in their own province and elsewhere. The Museum was given up to Indian arts and manufactures, and anybody who sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain.\n\n\u201cOff! Off! Let me up!\u201d cried Abdullah, climbing up Zam-Zammah\u2019s wheel.\n\n\u201cThy father was a pastry-cook, Thy mother stole the _ghi_,\u201d sang Kim. \u201cAll Mussalmans fell off Zam-Zammah long ago!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet _me_ up!\u201d shrilled little Chota Lal in his gilt-embroidered cap. His father was worth perhaps half a million sterling, but India is the only democratic land in the world.\n\n\u201cThe Hindus fell off Zam-Zammah too. The Mussalmans pushed them off. Thy father was a pastry-cook\u2014\u201d\n\n\nHe stopped; for there shuffled round the corner, from the roaring Motee Bazar, such a man as Kim, who thought he knew all castes, had never seen. He was nearly six feet high, dressed in fold upon fold of dingy stuff like horse-blanketing, and not one fold of it could Kim refer to any known trade or profession. At his belt hung a long open-work iron pencase and a wooden rosary such as holy men wear. On his head was a gigantic sort of tam-o\u2019-shanter. His face was yellow and wrinkled, like that of Fook Shing, the Chinese bootmaker in the bazar. His eyes turned up at the corners and looked like little slits of onyx.\n\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d said Kim to his companions.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it is a man,\u201d said Abdullah, finger in mouth, staring.\n\n\u201cWithout doubt,\u201d returned Kim; \u201cbut he is no man of India that _I_ have ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cA priest, perhaps,\u201d said Chota Lal, spying the rosary. \u201cSee! He goes into the Wonder House!\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, nay,\u201d said the policeman, shaking his head. \u201cI do not understand your talk.\u201d The constable spoke Punjabi. \u201cO Friend of all the World, what does he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cSend him hither,\u201d said Kim, dropping from Zam-Zammah, flourishing his bare heels. \u201cHe is a foreigner, and thou art a buffalo.\u201d\n\nThe man turned helplessly and drifted towards the boys. He was old, and his woollen gaberdine still reeked of the stinking artemisia of the mountain passes.",
    "They entered the fort-like railway station, black in the end of night; the electrics sizzling over the goods-yard where they handle the heavy Northern grain-traffic.\n\n\u201cThis is the work of devils!\u201d said the lama, recoiling from the hollow echoing darkness, the glimmer of rails between the masonry platforms, and the maze of girders above. He stood in a gigantic stone hall paved, it seemed, with the sheeted dead third-class passengers who had taken their tickets overnight and were sleeping in the waiting-rooms. All hours of the twenty-four are alike to Orientals, and their passenger traffic is regulated accordingly.\n\n\u201cThis is where the fire-carriages come. One stands behind that hole\u201d\u2014Kim pointed to the ticket-office\u2014\u201cwho will give thee a paper to take thee to Umballa.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we go to Benares,\u201d he replied petulantly.\n\n\u201cAll one. Benares then. Quick: she comes!\u201d\n\n\u201cTake thou the purse.\u201d\n\nThe lama, not so well used to trains as he had pretended, started as the 3.25 a.m. south-bound roared in. The sleepers sprang to life, and the station filled with clamour and shoutings, cries of water and sweetmeat vendors, shouts of native policemen, and shrill yells of women gathering up their baskets, their families, and their husbands.\n\n\u201cIt is the train\u2014only the _te-rain_. It will not come here. Wait!\u201d\nAmazed at the lama\u2019s immense simplicity (he had handed him a small bag full of rupees), Kim asked and paid for a ticket to Umballa. A sleepy clerk grunted and flung out a ticket to the next station, just six miles distant.\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d said Kim, scanning it with a grin. \u201cThis may serve for farmers, but I live in the city of Lahore. It was cleverly done, Babu. Now give the ticket to Umballa.\u201d\n\nThe Babu scowled and dealt the proper ticket.\n\n\u201cNow another to Amritzar,\u201d said Kim, who had no notion of spending Mahbub Ali\u2019s money on anything so crude as a paid ride to Umballa. \u201cThe price is so much. The small money in return is just so much. I know the ways of the _te-rain_ ... Never did _yogi_ need _chela_ as thou dost,\u201d he went on merrily to the bewildered lama. \u201cThey would have flung thee out at Mian Mir but for me. This way! Come!\u201d He returned the money, keeping only one anna in each rupee of the price of the Umballa ticket as his commission\u2014the immemorial commission of Asia.\n\nThe lama jibbed at the open door of a crowded third-class carriage.\n\n\u201cWere it not better to walk?\u201d said he weakly.\n\nA burly Sikh artisan thrust forth his bearded head. \u201cIs he afraid? Do not be afraid. I remember the time when I was afraid of the train. Enter! This thing is the work of the Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not fear,\u201d said the lama. \u201cHave ye room within for two?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no room even for a mouse,\u201d shrilled the wife of a well-to-do cultivator\u2014a Hindu Jat from the rich Jullundur, district. Our night trains are not as well looked after as the day ones, where the sexes are very strictly kept to separate carriages.\n\n\u201cOh, mother of my son, we can make space,\u201d said the blueturbaned husband. \u201cPick up the child. It is a holy man, see\u2019st thou?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd my lap full of seventy times seven bundles! Why not bid him sit on my knee, Shameless? But men are ever thus!\u201d She looked round for approval. An Amritzar courtesan near the window sniffed behind her head drapery.\n\n\u201cEnter! Enter!\u201d cried a fat Hindu money-lender, his folded account-book in a cloth under his arm. With an oily smirk: \u201cIt is well to be kind to the poor.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, at seven per cent a month with a mortgage on the unborn calf,\u201d said a young Dogra soldier going south on leave; and they all laughed.\n\n\u201cWill it travel to Benares?\u201d said the lama.\n\n\u201cAssuredly. Else why should we come? Enter, or we are left,\u201d cried Kim.\n\n\u201cSee!\u201d shrilled the Amritzar girl. \u201cHe has never entered a train. Oh, see!\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, help,\u201d said the cultivator, putting out a large brown hand and hauling him in. \u201cThus is it done, father.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014but\u2014I sit on the floor. It is against the Rule to sit on a bench,\u201d said the lama. \u201cMoreover, it cramps me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say,\u201d began the money-lender, pursing his lips, \u201cthat there is not one rule of right living which these _te-rains_ do not cause us to break. We sit, for example, side by side with all castes and peoples.\u201d\n\n\u201cYea, and with most outrageously shameless ones,\u201d said the wife, scowling at the Amritzar girl making eyes at the young sepoy.\n\n\u201cI said we might have gone by cart along the road,\u201d said the husband, \u201cand thus have saved some money.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2014and spent twice over what we saved on food by the way. That was talked out ten thousand times.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, by ten thousand tongues,\u201d grunted he.\n\n\u201cThe Gods help us poor women if we may not speak. Oho! He is of that sort which may not look at or reply to a woman.\u201d For the lama, constrained by his Rule, took not the faintest notice of her. \u201cAnd his disciple is like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, mother,\u201d said Kim most promptly. \u201cNot when the woman is well-looking and above all charitable to the hungry.\u201d\n\n\u201cA beggar\u2019s answer,\u201d said the Sikh, laughing. \u201cThou hast brought it on thyself, sister!\u201d Kim\u2019s hands were crooked in supplication.\n\n\u201cAnd whither goest thou?\u201d said the woman, handing him the half of a cake from a greasy package.\n\n\u201cEven to Benares.\u201d\n\n\u201cJugglers belike?\u201d the young soldier suggested. \u201cHave ye any tricks to pass the time? Why does not that yellow man answer?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d said Kim stoutly, \u201che is holy, and thinks upon matters hidden from thee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat may be well. We of the Ludhiana Sikhs\u201d\u2014he rolled it out sonorously\u2014\u201cdo not trouble our heads with doctrine. We fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sister\u2019s brother\u2019s son is _naik_ (corporal) in that regiment,\u201d said the Sikh craftsman quietly. \u201cThere are also some Dogra companies there.\u201d The soldier glared, for a Dogra is of other caste than a Sikh, and the banker tittered.\n\n\u201cThey are all one to me,\u201d said the Amritzar girl.\n\n\u201cThat we believe,\u201d snorted the cultivator\u2019s wife malignantly.\n\n\u201cNay, but all who serve the Sirkar with weapons in their hands are, as it were, one brotherhood. There is one brotherhood of the caste, but beyond that again\u201d\u2014she looked round timidly\u2014\u201cthe bond of the _Pulton_\u2014the Regiment\u2014eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy brother is in a Jat regiment,\u201d said the cultivator. \u201cDogras be good men.\u201d\n\n\u201cThy Sikhs at least were of that opinion,\u201d said the soldier, with a scowl at the placid old man in the corner. \u201c_Thy_ Sikhs thought so when our two companies came to help them at the Pirzai Kotal in the face of eight Afridi standards on the ridge not three months gone.\u201d\n\n\nHe told the story of a Border action in which the Dogra companies of the Ludhiana Sikhs had acquitted themselves well. The Amritzar girl smiled; for she knew the talk was to win her approval.",
    "\u201cThe long Road that overpasses all the rivers of Hind,\u201d said the lama gaily. \u201cLet us go. But how thinkest thou, _chela_, to recompense these people, and especially the priest, for their great kindness? Truly they are _b\u016bt-parast_, but in other lives, maybe, they will receive enlightenment. A rupee to the temple? The thing within is no more than stone and red paint, but the heart of man we must acknowledge when and where it is good.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly One, hast thou ever taken the Road alone?\u201d Kim looked up sharply, like the Indian crows so busy about the fields.\n\n\u201cSurely, child: from Kulu to Path\u00e2nkot\u2014from Kulu, where my first _chela_ died. When men were kind to us we made offerings, and all men were well-disposed throughout all the Hills.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is otherwise in Hind,\u201d said Kim drily. \u201cTheir Gods are many-armed and malignant. Let them alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would set thee on thy road for a little, Friend of all the World, thou and thy yellow man.\u201d The old soldier ambled up the village street, all shadowy in the dawn, on a punt, scissor-hocked pony. \u201cLast night broke up the fountains of remembrance in my so-dried heart, and it was as a blessing to me. Truly there is war abroad in the air. I smell it. See! I have brought my sword.\u201d\n\nHe sat long-legged on the little beast, with the big sword at his side\u2014hand dropped on the pommel\u2014staring fiercely over the flat lands towards the North. \u201cTell me again how He showed in thy vision. Come up and sit behind me. The beast will carry two.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am this Holy One\u2019s disciple,\u201d said Kim, as they cleared the village-gate. The villagers seemed almost sorry to be rid of them, but the priest\u2019s farewell was cold and distant. He had wasted some opium on a man who carried no money.\n\n\u201cThat is well spoken. I am not much used to holy men, but respect is always good. There is no respect in these days\u2014not even when a Commissioner Sahib comes to see me. But why should one whose Star leads him to war follow a holy man?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he _is_ a holy man,\u201d said Kim earnestly. \u201cIn truth, and in talk and in act, holy. He is not like the others. I have never seen such an one. We be not fortune-tellers, or jugglers, or beggars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThou art not. That I can see. But I do not know that other. He marches well, though.\u201d\n\nThe first freshness of the day carried the lama forward with long, easy, camel-like strides. He was deep in meditation, mechanically clicking his rosary.\n\nThey followed the rutted and worn country road that wound across the flat between the great dark-green mango-groves, the line of the snowcapped Himalayas faint to the eastward. All India was at work in the fields, to the creaking of well-wheels, the shouting of ploughmen behind their cattle, and the clamour of the crows. Even the pony felt the good influence and almost broke into a trot as Kim laid a hand on the stirrup-leather.\n\n\u201cIt repents me that I did not give a rupee to the shrine,\u201d said the lama on the last bead of his eighty-one.\n\nThe old soldier growled in his beard, so that the lama for the first time was aware of him.\n\n\u201cSeekest thou the River also?\u201d said he, turning.\n\n\u201cThe day is new,\u201d was the reply. \u201cWhat need of a river save to water at before sundown? I come to show thee a short lane to the Big Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a courtesy to be remembered, O man of good will. But why the sword?\u201d\n\nThe old soldier looked as abashed as a child interrupted in his game of make-believe.\n\n\u201cThe sword,\u201d he said, fumbling it. \u201cOh, that was a fancy of mine an old man\u2019s fancy. Truly the police orders are that no man must bear weapons throughout Hind, but\u201d\u2014he cheered up and slapped the hilt\u2014\u201call the constabeels hereabout know me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a good fancy,\u201d said the lama. \u201cWhat profit to kill men?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery little\u2014as I know; but if evil men were not now and then slain it would not be a good world for weaponless dreamers. I do not speak without knowledge who have seen the land from Delhi south awash with blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat madness was that, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Gods, who sent it for a plague, alone know. A madness ate into all the Army, and they turned against their officers. That was the first evil, but not past remedy if they had then held their hands. But they chose to kill the Sahibs\u2019 wives and children. Then came the Sahibs from over the sea and called them to most strict account.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome such rumour, I believe, reached me once long ago. They called it the Black Year, as I remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat manner of life hast thou led, not to know The Year? A rumour indeed! All earth knew, and trembled!\u201d\n\n\u201cOur earth never shook but once\u2014upon the day that the Excellent One received Enlightenment.\u201d\n\n\u201cUmph! I saw Delhi shake at least\u2014and Delhi is the navel of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they turned against women and children? That was a bad deed, for which the punishment cannot be avoided.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany strove to do so, but with very small profit. I was then in a regiment of cavalry. It broke. Of six hundred and eighty sabres stood fast to their salt\u2014how many, think you? Three. Of whom I was one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greater merit.\u201d\n\n\u201cMerit! We did not consider it merit in those days. My people, my friends, my brothers fell from me. They said: \u2018The time of the English is accomplished. Let each strike out a little holding for himself.\u2019 But I had talked with the men of Sobraon, of Chilianwallah, of Moodkee and Ferozeshah. I said: \u2018Abide a little and the wind turns. There is no blessing in this work.\u2019 In those days I rode seventy miles with an English Memsahib and her babe on my saddle-bow. (Wow! That was a horse fit for a man!) I placed them in safety, and back came I to my officer\u2014the one that was not killed of our five. \u2018Give me work,\u2019 said I, \u2018for I am an outcast among my own kind, and my cousin\u2019s blood is wet on my sabre.\u2019 \u2018Be content,\u2019 said he. \u2018There is great work forward. When this madness is over there is a recompense.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, there is a recompense when the madness is over, surely?\u201d the lama muttered half to himself.\n\n\u201cThey did not hang medals in those days on all who by accident had heard a gun fired. No! In nineteen pitched battles was I; in six-and-forty skirmishes of horse; and in small affairs without number. Nine wounds I bear; a medal and four clasps and the medal of an Order, for my captains, who are now generals, remembered me when the Kaisar-i-Hind had accomplished fifty years of her reign, and all the land rejoiced. They said: \u2018Give him the Order of Berittish India.\u2019 I carry it upon my neck now. I have also my _jaghir_ (holding) from the hands of the State\u2014a free gift to me and mine. The men of the old days\u2014they are now Commissioners\u2014come riding to me through the crops\u2014high upon horses so that all the village sees\u2014and we talk out the old skirmishes, one dead man\u2019s name leading to another.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after?\u201d said the lama.\n\n\u201cOh, afterwards they go away, but not before my village has seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd at the last what wilt thou do?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the last I shall die.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet the Gods order it. I have never pestered Them with prayers. I do not think They will pester me. Look you, I have noticed in my long life that those who eternally break in upon Those Above with complaints and reports and bellowings and weepings are presently sent for in haste, as our Colonel used to send for slack-jawed down-country men who talked too much. No, I have never wearied the Gods. They will remember this, and give me a quiet place where I can drive my lance in the shade, and wait to welcome my sons: I have no less than three Rissaldar\u2014majors all\u2014in the regiments.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd they likewise, bound upon the Wheel, go forth from life to life\u2014from despair to despair,\u201d said the lama below his breath, \u201chot, uneasy, snatching.\u201d",
    "Now a genuine imported Sahib from England would have made a great to-do over this tale. Lurgan Sahib stated it as simply as Mahbub Ali was used to record his little affairs in the North. The back veranda of the shop was built out over the sheer hillside, and they looked down into their neighbours\u2019 chimney-pots, as is the custom of Simla. But even more than the purely Persian meal cooked by Lurgan Sahib with his own hands, the shop fascinated Kim. The Lahore Museum was larger, but here were more wonders\u2014ghost-daggers and prayer-wheels from Tibet; turquoise and raw amber necklaces; green jade bangles; curiously packed incense-sticks in jars crusted over with raw garnets; the devil-masks of overnight and a wall full of peacock-blue draperies; gilt figures of Buddha, and little portable lacquer altars; Russian samovars with turquoises on the lid; egg-shell china sets in quaint octagonal cane boxes; yellow ivory crucifixes\u2014from Japan of all places in the world, so Lurgan Sahib said; carpets in dusty bales, smelling atrociously, pushed back behind torn and rotten screens of geometrical work; Persian water-jugs for the hands after meals; dull copper incense-burners neither Chinese nor Persian, with friezes of fantastic devils running round them; tarnished silver belts that knotted like raw hide; hairpins of jade, ivory, and plasma; arms of all sorts and kinds, and a thousand other oddments were cased, or piled, or merely thrown into the room, leaving a clear space only round the rickety deal table, where Lurgan Sahib worked.\n\n\u201cThose things are nothing,\u201d said his host, following Kim\u2019s glance. \u201cI buy them because they are pretty, and sometimes I sell\u2014if I like the buyer\u2019s look. My work is on the table\u2014some of it.\u201d\n\nIt blazed in the morning light\u2014all red and blue and green flashes, picked out with the vicious blue-white spurt of a diamond here and there. Kim opened his eyes.\n\n\u201cOh, they are quite well, those stones. It will not hurt them to take the sun. Besides, they are cheap. But with sick stones it is very different.\u201d He piled Kim\u2019s plate anew. \u201cThere is no one but _me_ can doctor a sick pearl and re-blue turquoises. I grant you opals\u2014any fool can cure an opal\u2014but for a sick pearl there is only me. Suppose I were to die! Then there would be no one ... Oh no! _You_ cannot do anything with jewels. It will be quite enough if you understand a little about the Turquoise\u2014some day.\u201d\n\nHe moved to the end of the veranda to refill the heavy, porous clay water-jug from the filter.\n\n\u201cDo you want drink?\u201d\n\nKim nodded. Lurgan Sahib, fifteen feet off, laid one hand on the jar. Next instant, it stood at Kim\u2019s elbow, full to within half an inch of the brim\u2014the white cloth only showing, by a small wrinkle, where it had slid into place.\n\n\u201cWah!\u201d said Kim in most utter amazement. \u201cThat is magic.\u201d Lurgan Sahib\u2019s smile showed that the compliment had gone home.\n\n\u201cThrow it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will break.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say, throw it back.\u201d\n\nKim pitched it at random. It fell short and crashed into fifty pieces, while the water dripped through the rough veranda boarding.\n\n\u201cI said it would break.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll one. Look at it. Look at the largest piece.\u201d\n\nThat lay with a sparkle of water in its curve, as it were a star on the floor. Kim looked intently. Lurgan Sahib laid one hand gently on the nape of his neck, stroked it twice or thrice, and whispered: \u201cLook! It shall come to life again, piece by piece. First the big piece shall join itself to two others on the right and the left\u2014on the right and the left. Look!\u201d\n\nTo save his life, Kim could not have turned his head. The light touch held him as in a vice, and his blood tingled pleasantly through him. There was one large piece of the jar where there had been three, and above them the shadowy outline of the entire vessel. He could see the veranda through it, but it was thickening and darkening with each beat of his pulse. Yet the jar\u2014how slowly the thoughts came!\u2014the jar had been smashed before his eyes. Another wave of prickling fire raced down his neck, as Lurgan Sahib moved his hand.\n\n\u201cLook! It is coming into shape,\u201d said Lurgan Sahib.\n\nSo far Kim had been thinking in Hindi, but a tremor came on him, and with an effort like that of a swimmer before sharks, who hurls himself half out of the water, his mind leaped up from a darkness that was swallowing it and took refuge in\u2014the multiplication-table in English!\n\n\u201cLook! It is coming into shape,\u201d whispered Lurgan Sahib.\n\nThe jar had been smashed\u2014yess, smashed\u2014not the native word, he would not think of that\u2014but smashed\u2014into fifty pieces, and twice three was six, and thrice three was nine, and four times three was twelve. He clung desperately to the repetition. The shadow-outline of the jar cleared like a mist after rubbing eyes. There were the broken shards; there was the spilt water drying in the sun, and through the cracks of the veranda showed, all ribbed, the white house-wall below\u2014and thrice twelve was thirty-six!\n\n\u201cLook! Is it coming into shape?\u201d asked Lurgan Sahib.\n\n\u201cBut it is smashed\u2014smashed,\u201d he gasped\u2014Lurgan Sahib had been muttering softly for the last half-minute. Kim wrenched his head aside. \u201cLook! _Dekho!_ It is there as it was there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is there as it was there,\u201d said Lurgan, watching Kim closely while the boy rubbed his neck. \u201cBut you are the first of many who has ever seen it so.\u201d He wiped his broad forehead.\n\n\u201cWas that more magic?\u201d Kim asked suspiciously. The tingle had gone from his veins; he felt unusually wide awake.\n\n\u201cNo, that was not magic. It was only to see if there was\u2014a flaw in a jewel. Sometimes very fine jewels will fly all to pieces if a man holds them in his hand, and knows the proper way. That is why one must be careful before one sets them. Tell me, did you see the shape of the pot?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a little time. It began to grow like a flower from the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then what did you do? I mean, how did you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cOah! I knew it was broken, and so, I think, that was what I thought\u2014and it was broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm! Has anyone ever done that same sort of magic to you before?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it was,\u201d said Kim \u201cdo you think I should let it again? I should run away.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now you are not afraid\u2014eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now.\u201d\n\nLurgan Sahib looked at him more closely than ever. \u201cI shall ask Mahbub Ali\u2014not now, but some day later,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI am pleased with you\u2014yes; and I am pleased with you\u2014no. You are the first that ever saved himself. I wish I knew what it was that ... But you are right. You should not tell that\u2014not even to me.\u201d\n\n\nHe turned into the dusky gloom of the shop, and sat down at the table, rubbing his hands softly. A small, husky sob came from behind a pile of carpets. It was the Hindu child obediently facing towards the wall. His thin shoulders worked with grief.\n\n\u201cAh! He is jealous, so jealous. I wonder if he will try to poison me again in my breakfast, and make me cook it twice.\n\n\u201c_Kubbee_\u2014_kubbee nahin,_\u201d came the broken answer.\n\n\u201cAnd whether he will kill this other boy?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Kubbee\u2014kubbee nahin._\u201d (Never\u2014never. No!)\n\n\u201cWhat do _you_ think he will do?\u201d He turned suddenly on Kim.\n\n\u201cOah! I do not know. Let him go, perhaps. Why did he want to poison you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he is so fond of me. Suppose you were fond of someone, and you saw someone come, and the man you were fond of was more pleased with him than he was with you, what would you do?\u201d\n\nKim thought. Lurgan repeated the sentence slowly in the vernacular.\n\n\u201cI should not poison that man,\u201d said Kim reflectively, \u201cbut I should beat that boy\u2014_if_ that boy was fond of my man. But first, I would ask that boy if it were true.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! He thinks everyone must be fond of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I think he is a fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cHearest thou?\u201d said Lurgan Sahib to the shaking shoulders. \u201cThe Sahib\u2019s son thinks thou art a little fool. Come out, and next time thy heart is troubled, do not try white arsenic quite so openly. Surely the Devil Dasim was lord of our table-cloth that day! It might have made me ill, child, and then a stranger would have guarded the jewels. Come!\u201d\n\nThe child, heavy-eyed with much weeping, crept out from behind the bale and flung himself passionately at Lurgan Sahib\u2019s feet, with an extravagance of remorse that impressed even Kim.\n\n\u201cI will look into the ink-pools\u2014I will faithfully guard the jewels! Oh, my Father and my Mother, send _him_ away!\u201d He indicated Kim with a backward jerk of his bare heel.\n\n\u201cNot yet\u2014not yet. In a little while he will go away again. But now he is at school\u2014at a new _madrissah_\u2014and thou shalt be his teacher. Play the Play of the Jewels against him. I will keep tally.\u201d\n\nThe child dried his tears at once, and dashed to the back of the shop, whence he returned with a copper tray.\n\n\u201cGive me!\u201d he said to Lurgan Sahib. \u201cLet them come from thy hand, for he may say that I knew them before.\u201d\n\n\u201cGently\u2014gently,\u201d the man replied, and from a drawer under the table dealt a half-handful of clattering trifles into the tray.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the child, waving an old newspaper. \u201cLook on them as long as thou wilt, stranger. Count and, if need be, handle. One look is enough for _me_.\u201d He turned his back proudly.\n\n\u201cBut what is the game?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen thou hast counted and handled and art sure that thou canst remember them all, I cover them with this paper, and thou must tell over the tally to Lurgan Sahib. _I_ will write mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cOah!\u201d The instinct of competition waked in his breast. He bent over the tray. There were but fifteen stones on it. \u201cThat is easy,\u201d he said after a minute. The child slipped the paper over the winking jewels and scribbled in a native account-book.\n\n\u201cThere are under that paper five blue stones\u2014one big, one smaller, and three small,\u201d said Kim, all in haste. \u201cThere are four green stones, and one with a hole in it; there is one yellow stone that I can see through, and one like a pipe-stem. There are two red stones, and\u2014and\u2014I made the count fifteen, but two I have forgotten. No! Give me time. One was of ivory, little and brownish; and\u2014and\u2014give me time...\u201d\n\n\u201cOne\u2014two\u201d\u2014Lurgan Sahib counted him out up to ten. Kim shook his head.\n\n\u201cHear my count!\u201d the child burst in, trilling with laughter. \u201cFirst, are two flawed sapphires\u2014one of two ruttees and one of four as I should judge. The four-ruttee sapphire is chipped at the edge. There is one Turkestan turquoise, plain with black veins, and there are two inscribed\u2014one with a Name of God in gilt, and the other being cracked across, for it came out of an old ring, I cannot read. We have now all five blue stones. Four flawed emeralds there are, but one is drilled in two places, and one is a little carven\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir weights?\u201d said Lurgan Sahib impassively.\n\n\u201cThree\u2014five\u2014five\u2014and four ruttees as I judge it. There is one piece of old greenish pipe amber, and a cut topaz from Europe. There is one ruby of Burma, of two ruttees, without a flaw, and there is a balas-ruby, flawed, of two ruttees. There is a carved ivory from China representing a rat sucking an egg; and there is last\u2014ah ha!\u2014a ball of crystal as big as a bean set on a gold leaf.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands at the close.\n\n\u201cHe is thy master,\u201d said Lurgan Sahib, smiling.\n\n\u201cHuh! He knew the names of the stones,\u201d said Kim, flushing. \u201cTry again! With common things such as he and I both know.\u201d\n\nThey heaped the tray again with odds and ends gathered from the shop, and even the kitchen, and every time the child won, till Kim marvelled.\n\n\u201cBind my eyes\u2014let me feel once with my fingers, and even _then_ I will leave thee opened-eyed behind,\u201d he challenged.\n\nKim stamped with vexation when the lad made his boast good.\n\n\u201cIf it were men\u2014or horses,\u201d he said, \u201cI could do better. This playing with tweezers and knives and scissors is too little.\u201d\n\n\u201cLearn first\u2014teach later,\u201d said Lurgan Sahib. \u201cIs he thy master?\u201d\n\n\u201cTruly. But how is it done?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy doing it many times over till it is done perfectly\u2014for it is worth doing.\u201d\n\nThe Hindu boy, in highest feather, actually patted Kim on the back.\n\n\u201cDo not despair,\u201d he said. \u201cI myself will teach thee.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I will see that thou art well taught,\u201d said Lurgan Sahib, still speaking in the vernacular, \u201cfor except my boy here\u2014it was foolish of him to buy so much white arsenic when, if he had asked, I could have given it\u2014except my boy here I have not in a long time met with one better worth teaching. And there are ten days more ere thou canst return to Lucknao where they teach nothing\u2014at the long price. We shall, I think, be friends.\u201d",
    "So, in a silence of awe and great miscomprehension, they slid into Delhi about lamp-lighting time.\n\n\u201cI have found my heart again,\u201d said E23, under cover of the platform\u2019s tumult. \u201cHunger and fear make men dazed, or I might have thought of this escape before. I was right. They come to hunt for me. Thou hast saved my head.\u201d\n\nA group of yellow-trousered Punjab policemen, headed by a hot and perspiring young Englishman, parted the crowd about the carriages. Behind them, inconspicuous as a cat, ambled a small fat person who looked like a lawyer\u2019s tout.\n\n\u201cSee the young Sahib reading from a paper. My description is in his hand,\u201d said E23. \u201cThey go carriage by carriage, like fisher-folk netting a pool.\u201d\n\nWhen the procession reached their compartment, E23 was counting his beads with a steady jerk of the wrist; while Kim jeered at him for being so drugged as to have lost the ringed fire-tongs which are the Saddhu\u2019s distinguishing mark. The lama, deep in meditation, stared straight before him; and the farmer, glancing furtively, gathered up his belongings.\n\n\u201cNothing here but a parcel of holy-bolies,\u201d said the Englishman aloud, and passed on amid a ripple of uneasiness; for native police mean extortion to the native all India over.\n\n\u201cThe trouble now,\u201d whispered E23, \u201clies in sending a wire as to the place where I hid that letter I was sent to find. I cannot go to the _tar_-office in this guise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it not enough I have saved thy neck?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if the work be left unfinished. Did never the healer of sick pearls tell thee so? Comes another Sahib! Ah!\u201d\n\nThis was a tallish, sallowish District Superintendent of Police\u2014belt, helmet, polished spurs and all\u2014strutting and twirling his dark moustache.\n\n\u201cWhat fools are these Police Sahibs!\u201d said Kim genially.\n\nE23 glanced up under his eyelids. \u201cIt is well said,\u201d he muttered in a changed voice. \u201cI go to drink water. Keep my place.\u201d\n\nHe blundered out almost into the Englishman\u2019s arms, and was bad-worded in clumsy Urdu.\n\n\u201c_Tum mut?_ You drunk? You mustn\u2019t bang about as though Delhi station belonged to you, my friend.\u201d\n\nE23, not moving a muscle of his countenance, answered with a stream of the filthiest abuse, at which Kim naturally rejoiced. It reminded him of the drummer-boys and the barrack-sweepers at Umballa in the terrible time of his first schooling.\n\n\u201cMy good fool,\u201d the Englishman drawled. \u201c_Nickle-jao!_ Go back to your carriage.\u201d\n\nStep by step, withdrawing deferentially and dropping his voice, the yellow Saddhu clomb back to the carriage, cursing the D.S.P. to remotest posterity, by\u2014here Kim almost jumped\u2014by the curse of the Queen\u2019s Stone, by the writing under the Queen\u2019s Stone, and by an assortment of Gods with wholly new names.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying,\u201d\u2014the Englishman flushed angrily\u2014\u201cbut it\u2019s some piece of blasted impertinence. Come out of that!\u201d\n\nE23, affecting to misunderstand, gravely produced his ticket, which the Englishman wrenched angrily from his hand.\n\n\u201cOh, _zoolum!_ What oppression!\u201d growled the Jat from his corner. \u201cAll for the sake of a jest too.\u201d He had been grinning at the freedom of the Saddhu\u2019s tongue. \u201cThy charms do not work well today, Holy One!\u201d\n\nThe Saddhu followed the policeman, fawning and supplicating. The ruck of passengers, busy with their babies and their bundles, had not noticed the affair. Kim slipped out behind him; for it flashed through his head that he had heard this angry, stupid Sahib discoursing loud personalities to an old lady near Umballa three years ago.\n\n\u201cIt is well,\u201d the Saddhu whispered, jammed in the calling, shouting, bewildered press\u2014a Persian greyhound between his feet and a cageful of yelling hawks under charge of a Rajput falconer in the small of his back. \u201cHe has gone now to send word of the letter which I hid. They told me he was in Peshawur. I might have known that he is like the crocodile\u2014always at the other ford. He has saved me from present calamity, but I owe my life to thee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he also one of Us?\u201d Kim ducked under a Mewar camel-driver\u2019s greasy armpit and cannoned off a covey of jabbering Sikh matrons.\n\n\u201cNot less than the greatest. We are both fortunate! I will make report to him of what thou hast done. I am safe under his protection.\u201d\n\nHe bored through the edge of the crowd besieging the carriages, and squatted by the bench near the telegraph-office.\n\n\u201cReturn, or they take thy place! Have no fear for the work, brother\u2014or my life. Thou hast given me breathing-space, and Strickland Sahib has pulled me to land. We may work together at the Game yet. Farewell!\u201d\n\nKim hurried to his carriage: elated, bewildered, but a little nettled in that he had no key to the secrets about him.\n\n\u201cI am only a beginner at the Game, that is sure. _I_ could not have leaped into safety as did the Saddhu. He knew it was darkest under the lamp. _I_ could not have thought to tell news under pretence of cursing ... and how clever was the Sahib! No matter, I saved the life of one ... Where is the Kamboh gone, Holy One?\u201d he whispered, as he took his seat in the now crowded compartment.\n\n\u201cA fear gripped him,\u201d the lama replied, with a touch of tender malice. \u201cHe saw thee change the Mahratta to a Saddhu in the twinkling of an eye, as a protection against evil. That shook him. Then he saw the Saddhu fall sheer into the hands of the _polis_\u2014all the effect of thy art. Then he gathered up his son and fled; for he said that thou didst change a quiet trader into an impudent bandier of words with the Sahibs, and he feared a like fate. Where is the Saddhu?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the _polis_,\u201d said Kim ... \u201cYet I saved the Kamboh\u2019s child.\u201d\n\nThe lama snuffed blandly.\n\n\u201cAh, _chela_, see how thou art overtaken! Thou didst cure the Kamboh\u2019s child solely to acquire merit. But thou didst put a spell on the Mahratta with prideful workings\u2014I watched thee\u2014and with sidelong glances to bewilder an old old man and a foolish farmer: whence calamity and suspicion.\u201d\n\nKim controlled himself with an effort beyond his years. Not more than any other youngster did he like to eat dirt or to be misjudged, but he saw himself in a cleft stick. The train rolled out of Delhi into the night.\n\n\u201cIt is true,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhere I have offended thee I have done wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is more, _chela_. Thou hast loosed an Act upon the world, and as a stone thrown into a pool so spread the consequences thou canst not tell how far.\u201d",
    "\u201cHi! I have an ulcer on my leg,\u201d cried a scullion. \u201cLook at it!\u201d\n\n\u201cGet hence! Remove!\u201d said the _hakim_. \u201cIs it the habit of the place to pester honoured guests? Ye crowd in like buffaloes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Sahiba knew\u2014\u201d Kim began.\n\n\u201cAi! Ai! Come away. They are meat for our mistress. When her young Shaitan\u2019s colics are cured perhaps we poor people may be suffered to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mistress fed thy wife when thou wast in jail for breaking the money-lender\u2019s head. Who speaks against her?\u201d The old servitor curled his white moustaches savagely in the young moonlight. \u201c_I_ am responsible for the honour of this house. Go!\u201d and he drove the underlings before him.\n\nSaid the _hakim_, hardly more than shaping the words with his lips: \u201cHow do you do, Mister O\u2019Hara? I am jolly glad to see you again.\u201d\n\nKim\u2019s hand clenched about the pipe-stem. Anywhere on the open road, perhaps, he would not have been astonished; but here, in this quiet backwater of life, he was not prepared for Hurree Babu. It annoyed him, too, that he had been hoodwinked.\n\n\u201cAh ha! I told you at Lucknow\u2014_resurgam_\u2014I shall rise again and you shall not know me. How much did you bet\u2014eh?\u201d\n\nHe chewed leisurely upon a few cardamom seeds, but he breathed uneasily.\n\n\u201cBut why come here, Babuji?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! _Thatt_ is the question, as Shakespeare hath it. I come to congratulate you on your extraordinary effeecient performance at Delhi. Oah! I tell you we are all proud of you. It was verree neat and handy. Our mutual friend, he is old friend of mine. He has been in some dam\u2019-tight places. Now he will be in some more. He told me; I tell Mr Lurgan; and he is pleased you graduate so nicely. All the Department is pleased.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in his life, Kim thrilled to the clean pride (it can be a deadly pitfall, none the less) of Departmental praise\u2014ensnaring praise from an equal of work appreciated by fellow-workers. Earth has nothing on the same plane to compare with it. But, cried the Oriental in him, Babus do not travel far to retail compliments.\n\n\u201cTell thy tale, Babu,\u201d he said authoritatively.\n\n\u201cOah, it is nothing. Onlee I was at Simla when the wire came in about what our mutual friend said he had hidden, and old Creighton\u2014\u201d He looked to see how Kim would take this piece of audacity.\n\n\u201cThe Colonel Sahib,\u201d the boy from St Xavier\u2019s corrected.\n\n\u201c_Of_ course. He found me at a loose string, and I had to go down to Chitor to find that beastly letter. I do not like the South\u2014too much railway travel; but I drew good travelling allowance. Ha! Ha! I meet our mutual at Delhi on the way back. He lies quiett just now, and says Saddhu-disguise suits him to the ground. Well, there I hear what you have done so well, so quickly, upon the instantaneous spur of the moment. I tell our mutual you take the bally bun, by Jove! It was splendid. I come to tell you so.\u201d\n\n\u201cUmm!\u201d\n\nThe frogs were busy in the ditches, and the moon slid to her setting. Some happy servant had gone out to commune with the night and to beat upon a drum. Kim\u2019s next sentence was in the vernacular.\n\n\u201cHow didst thou follow us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOah. Thatt was nothing. I know from our mutual friend you go to Saharunpore. So I come on. Red Lamas are not inconspicuous persons. I buy myself my drug-box, and I am very good doctor really. I go to Akrola of the Ford, and hear all about you, and I talk here and talk there. All the common people know what you do. I knew when the hospitable old lady sent the _dooli_. They have great recollections of the old lama\u2019s visits here. I know old ladies cannot keep their hands from medicines. So I am a doctor, and\u2014you hear my talk? _I_ think it is verree good. My word, Mister O\u2019Hara, they know about you and the lama for fifty miles\u2014the common people. So I come. Do you mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cBabuji,\u201d said Kim, looking up at the broad, grinning face, \u201cI am a Sahib.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Mister O\u2019Hara\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I hope to play the Great Game.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are subordinate to me departmentally at present.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why talk like an ape in a tree? Men do not come after one from Simla and change their dress, for the sake of a few sweet words. I am not a child. Talk Hindi and let us get to the yolk of the egg. Thou art here\u2014speaking not one word of truth in ten. Why art thou here? Give a straight answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is so verree disconcerting of the Europeans, Mister O\u2019Hara. _You_ should know a heap better at your time of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I want to know,\u201d said Kim, laughing. \u201cIf it is the Game, I may help. How can I do anything if you _bukh_ (babble) all round the shop?\u201d\n\nHurree Babu reached for the pipe, and sucked it till it gurgled again.\n\n\u201cNow I will speak vernacular. You sit tight, Mister O\u2019Hara ... It concerns the pedigree of a white stallion.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill? That was finished long ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen everyone is dead the Great Game is finished. Not before. Listen to me till the end. There were Five Kings who prepared a sudden war three years ago, when thou wast given the stallion\u2019s pedigree by Mahbub Ali. Upon them, because of that news, and ere they were ready, fell our Army.\u201d\n\n\u201cAy\u2014eight thousand men with guns. I remember that night.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the war was not pushed. That is the Government custom. The troops were recalled because the Government believed the Five Kings were cowed; and it is not cheap to feed men among the high Passes. Hil\u00e1s and Bun\u00e1r\u2014Rajahs with guns\u2014undertook for a price to guard the Passes against all coming from the North. They protested both fear and friendship.\u201d He broke off with a giggle into English: \u201cOf course, I tell you this unoffeecially to elucidate political situation, Mister O\u2019Hara. Offeecially, I am debarred from criticizing any action of superiors. Now I go on.\u2014This pleased the Government, anxious to avoid expense, and a bond was made for so many rupees a month that Hil\u00e1s and Bun\u00e1r should guard the Passes as soon as the State\u2019s troops were withdrawn. At that time\u2014it was after we two met\u2014I, who had been selling tea in Leh, became a clerk of accounts in the Army. When the troops were withdrawn, I was left behind to pay the coolies who made new roads in the Hills. This road-making was part of the bond between Bun\u00e1r, Hil\u00e1s, and the Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo? And then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you, it was jolly-beastly cold up there too, after summer,\u201d said Hurree Babu confidentially. \u201cI was afraid these Bun\u00e1r men would cut my throat every night for thee pay-chest. My native sepoy-guard, they laughed at me! By Jove! I was such a fearful man. Nevar mind thatt. I go on colloquially ... I send word many times that these two Kings were sold to the North; and Mahbub Ali, who was yet farther North, amply confirmed it. Nothing was done. Only my feet were frozen, and a toe dropped off. I sent word that the roads for which I was paying money to the diggers were being made for the feet of strangers and enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the Russians. The thing was an open jest among the coolies. Then I was called down to tell what I knew by speech of tongue. Mahbub came South too. See the end! Over the Passes this year after snow-melting\u201d\u2014he shivered afresh\u2014\u201ccome two strangers under cover of shooting wild goats. They bear guns, but they bear also chains and levels and compasses.\u201d\n\n\u201cOho! The thing gets clearer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are well received by Hil\u00e1s and Bun\u00e1r. They make great promises; they speak as the mouthpiece of a Kaisar with gifts. Up the valleys, down the valleys go they, saying, \u2018Here is a place to build a breastwork; here can ye pitch a fort. Here can ye hold the road against an army\u2019\u2014the very roads for which I paid out the rupees monthly. The Government knows, but does nothing. The three other Kings, who were _not_ paid for guarding the Passes, tell them by runner of the bad faith of Bun\u00e1r and Hil\u00e1s. When all the evil is done, look you\u2014when these two strangers with the levels and the compasses make the Five Kings to believe that a great army will sweep the Passes tomorrow or the next day\u2014Hill-people are all fools\u2014comes the order to me, Hurree Babu, \u2018Go North and see what those strangers do.\u2019 I say to Creighton Sahib, \u2018This is not a lawsuit, that we go about to collect evidence.\u2019\u201d Hurree returned to his English with a jerk: \u201c\u2018By Jove,\u2019 I said, \u2018why the dooce do you not issue demi-offeecial orders to some brave man to poison them, for an example? It is, if you permit the observation, most reprehensible laxity on your part.\u2019 And Colonel Creighton, he laughed at me! It is all your beastly English pride. You think no one dare conspire! That is all tommy-rott.\u201d",
    "They crossed a snowy pass in cold moonlight, when the lama, mildly chaffing Kim, went through up to his knees, like a Bactrian camel\u2014the snow-bred, shag-haired sort that came into the Kashmir Serai. They dipped across beds of light snow and snow-powdered shale, where they took refuge from a gale in a camp of Tibetans hurrying down tiny sheep, each laden with a bag of borax. They came out upon grassy shoulders still snow-speckled, and through forest, to grass anew. For all their marchings, Kedarnath and Badrinath were not impressed; and it was only after days of travel that Kim, uplifted upon some insignificant ten-thousand-foot hummock, could see that a shoulder-knot or horn of the two great lords had\u2014ever so slightly\u2014changed outline.\n\nAt last they entered a world within a world\u2014a valley of leagues where the high hills were fashioned of a mere rubble and refuse from off the knees of the mountains. Here one day\u2019s march carried them no farther, it seemed, than a dreamer\u2019s clogged pace bears him in a nightmare. They skirted a shoulder painfully for hours, and, behold, it was but an outlying boss in an outlying buttress of the main pile! A rounded meadow revealed itself, when they had reached it, for a vast tableland running far into the valley. Three days later, it was a dim fold in the earth to southward.\n\n\u201cSurely the Gods live here!\u201d said Kim, beaten down by the silence and the appalling sweep and dispersal of the cloud-shadows after rain. \u201cThis is no place for men!\u201d\n\n\u201cLong and long ago,\u201d said the lama, as to himself, \u201cit was asked of the Lord whether the world were everlasting. On this the Excellent One returned no answer ... When I was in Ceylon, a wise Seeker confirmed that from the gospel which is written in Pali. Certainly, since we know the way to Freedom, the question were unprofitable, but\u2014look, and know illusion, _chela!_ These\u2014are the true Hills! They are like my hills by Suchzen. Never were such hills!\u201d\n\nAbove them, still enormously above them, earth towered away towards the snow-line, where from east to west across hundreds of miles, ruled as with a ruler, the last of the bold birches stopped. Above that, in scarps and blocks upheaved, the rocks strove to fight their heads above the white smother. Above these again, changeless since the world\u2019s beginning, but changing to every mood of sun and cloud, lay out the eternal snow. They could see blots and blurs on its face where storm and wandering wullie-wa got up to dance. Below them, as they stood, the forest slid away in a sheet of blue-green for mile upon mile; below the forest was a village in its sprinkle of terraced fields and steep grazing-grounds. Below the village they knew, though a thunderstorm worried and growled there for the moment, a pitch of twelve or fifteen hundred feet gave to the moist valley where the streams gather that are the mothers of young Sutluj.\n\nAs usual, the lama had led Kim by cow-track and by-road, far from the main route along which Hurree Babu, that \u201cfearful man\u201d, had bucketed three days before through a storm to which nine Englishmen out of ten would have given full right of way. Hurree was no game-shot\u2014the snick of a trigger made him change colour\u2014but, as he himself would have said, he was \u201cfairly effeecient stalker\u201d, and he had raked the huge valley with a pair of cheap binoculars to some purpose. Moreover, the white of worn canvas tents against green carries far. Hurree Babu had seen all he wanted to see when he sat on the threshing-floor of Ziglaur, twenty miles away as the eagle flies, and forty by road\u2014that is to say, two small dots which one day were just below the snow-line, and the next had moved downward perhaps six inches on the hillside. Once cleaned out and set to the work, his fat bare legs could cover a surprising amount of ground, and this was the reason why, while Kim and the lama lay in a leaky hut at Ziglaur till the storm should be over-past, an oily, wet, but always smiling Bengali, talking the best of English with the vilest of phrases, was ingratiating himself with two sodden and rather rheumatic foreigners. He had arrived, revolving many wild schemes, on the heels of a thunderstorm which had split a pine over against their camp, and so convinced a dozen or two forcibly impressed baggage-coolies the day was inauspicious for farther travel that with one accord they had thrown down their loads and jibbed. They were subjects of a Hill Rajah who farmed out their services, as is the custom, for his private gain; and, to add to their personal distresses, the strange Sahibs had already threatened them with rifles. The most of them knew rifles and Sahibs of old: they were trackers and _shikarris_ of the Northern valleys, keen after bear and wild goat; but they had never been thus treated in their lives. So the forest took them to her bosom, and, for all oaths and clamour, refused to restore. There was no need to feign madness or\u2014the Babu had thought of another means of securing a welcome. He wrung out his wet clothes, slipped on his patent-leather shoes, opened the blue-and-white umbrella, and with mincing gait and a heart beating against his tonsils appeared as \u201cagent for His Royal Highness, the Rajah of Rampur, gentlemen. What can I do for you, please?\u201d",
    "At moonrise the cautious coolies got under way. The lama, refreshed by his sleep and the spirit, needed no more than Kim\u2019s shoulder to bear him along\u2014a silent, swift-striding man. They held the shale-sprinkled grass for an hour, swept round the shoulder of an immortal cliff, and climbed into a new country entirely blocked off from all sight of Chini valley. A huge pasture-ground ran up fan-shaped to the living snow. At its base was perhaps half an acre of flat land, on which stood a few soil and timber huts. Behind them\u2014for, hill-fashion, they were perched on the edge of all things\u2014the ground fell sheer two thousand feet to Shamlegh-midden, where never yet man has set foot.\n\nThe men made no motion to divide the plunder till they had seen the lama bedded down in the best room of the place, with Kim shampooing his feet, Mohammedan-fashion.\n\n\u201cWe will send food,\u201d said the Ao-chung man, \u201cand the red-topped _kilta_. By dawn there will be none to give evidence, one way or the other. If anything is not needed in the _kilta_\u2014see here!\u201d\n\nHe pointed through the window\u2014opening into space that was filled with moonlight reflected from the snow\u2014and threw out an empty whisky-bottle.\n\n\u201cNo need to listen for the fall. This is the world\u2019s end,\u201d he said, and went out. The lama looked forth, a hand on either sill, with eyes that shone like yellow opals. From the enormous pit before him white peaks lifted themselves yearning to the moonlight. The rest was as the darkness of interstellar space.\n\n\u201cThese,\u201d he said slowly, \u201care indeed my Hills. Thus should a man abide, perched above the world, separated from delights, considering vast matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; if he has a _chela_ to prepare tea for him, and to fold a blanket for his head, and to chase out calving cows.\u201d\n\nA smoky lamp burned in a niche, but the full moonlight beat it down; and by the mixed light, stooping above the food-bag and cups, Kim moved like a tall ghost.\n\n\u201cAi! But now I have let the blood cool, my head still beats and drums, and there is a cord round the back of my neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo wonder. It was a strong blow. May he who dealt it\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut for my own passions there would have been no evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat evil? Thou hast saved the Sahibs from the death they deserved a hundred times.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lesson is not well learnt, _chela_.\u201d The lama came to rest on a folded blanket, as Kim went forward with his evening routine. \u201cThe blow was but a shadow upon a shadow. Evil in itself\u2014my legs weary apace these latter days!\u2014it met evil in me: anger, rage, and a lust to return evil. These wrought in my blood, woke tumult in my stomach, and dazzled my ears.\u201d Here he drank scalding black-tea ceremonially, taking the hot cup from Kim\u2019s hand. \u201cHad I been passionless, the evil blow would have done only bodily evil\u2014a scar, or a bruise\u2014which is illusion. But my mind was _not_ abstracted, for rushed in straightway a lust to let the Spiti men kill. In fighting that lust, my soul was torn and wrenched beyond a thousand blows. Not till I had repeated the Blessings\u201d (he meant the Buddhist Beatitudes) \u201cdid I achieve calm. But the evil planted in me by that moment\u2019s carelessness works out to its end. Just is the Wheel, swerving not a hair! Learn the lesson, _chela_.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is too high for me,\u201d Kim muttered. \u201cI am still all shaken. I am glad I hurt the man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt that, sleeping upon thy knees, in the wood below. It disquieted me in my dreams\u2014the evil in thy soul working through to mine. Yet on the other hand\u201d\u2014he loosed his rosary\u2014\u201cI have acquired merit by saving two lives\u2014the lives of those that wronged me. Now I must see into the Cause of Things. The boat of my soul staggers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSleep, and be strong. That is wisest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI meditate. There is a need greater than thou knowest.\u201d\n\nTill the dawn, hour after hour, as the moonlight paled on the high peaks, and that which had been belted blackness on the sides of the far hills showed as tender green forest, the lama stared fixedly at the wall. From time to time he groaned. Outside the barred door, where discomfited kine came to ask for their old stable, Shamlegh and the coolies gave itself up to plunder and riotous living. The Ao-chung man was their leader, and once they had opened the Sahibs\u2019 tinned foods and found that they were very good they dared not turn back. Shamlegh kitchen-midden took the dunnage.",
    "When Kim, after a night of bad dreams, stole forth to brush his teeth in the morning chill, a fair-coloured woman with turquoise-studded headgear drew him aside.\n\n\u201cThe others have gone. They left thee this _kilta_ as the promise was. I do not love Sahibs, but thou wilt make us a charm in return for it. We do not wish little Shamlegh to get a bad name on account of the\u2014accident. I am the Woman of Shamlegh.\u201d She looked him over with bold, bright eyes, unlike the usual furtive glance of hillwomen.\n\n\u201cAssuredly. But it must be done in secret.\u201d\n\nShe raised the heavy _kilta_ like a toy and slung it into her own hut.\n\n\u201cOut and bar the door! Let none come near till it is finished,\u201d said Kim.\n\n\u201cBut afterwards\u2014we may talk?\u201d\n\nKim tilted the _kilta_ on the floor\u2014a cascade of Survey-instruments, books, diaries, letters, maps, and queerly scented native correspondence. At the very bottom was an embroidered bag covering a sealed, gilded, and illuminated document such as one King sends to another. Kim caught his breath with delight, and reviewed the situation from a Sahib\u2019s point of view.\n\n\u201cThe books I do not want. Besides, they are logarithms\u2014Survey, I suppose.\u201d He laid them aside. \u201cThe letters I do not understand, but Colonel Creighton will. They must all be kept. The maps\u2014they draw better maps than me\u2014of course. All the native letters\u2014oho!\u2014and particularly the _murasla_.\u201d He sniffed the embroidered bag. \u201cThat must be from Hil\u00e1s or Bun\u00e1r, and Hurree Babu spoke truth. By Jove! It is a fine haul. I wish Hurree could know ... The rest must go out of the window.\u201d He fingered a superb prismatic compass and the shiny top of a theodolite. But after all, a Sahib cannot very well steal, and the things might be inconvenient evidence later. He sorted out every scrap of manuscript, every map, and the native letters. They made one softish slab. The three locked ferril-backed books, with five worn pocket-books, he put aside.\n\n\u201cThe letters and the _murasla_ I must carry inside my coat and under my belt, and the hand-written books I must put into the food-bag. It will be very heavy. No. I do not think there is anything more. If there is, the coolies have thrown it down the _khud_, so _thatt_ is all right. Now you go too.\u201d He repacked the _kilta_ with all he meant to lose, and hove it up on to the windowsill. A thousand feet below lay a long, lazy, round-shouldered bank of mist, as yet untouched by the morning sun. A thousand feet below that was a hundred-year-old pine-forest. He could see the green tops looking like a bed of moss when a wind-eddy thinned the cloud.\n\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t think any one will go after _you!_\u201d\n\nThe wheeling basket vomited its contents as it dropped. The theodolite hit a jutting cliff-ledge and exploded like a shell; the books, inkstands, paint-boxes, compasses, and rulers showed for a few seconds like a swarm of bees. Then they vanished; and, though Kim, hanging half out of the window, strained his young ears, never a sound came up from the gulf.\n\n\u201cFive hundred\u2014a thousand rupees could not buy them,\u201d he thought sorrowfully. \u201cIt was verree wasteful, but I have all their other stuff\u2014everything they did\u2014I hope. Now how the deuce am I to tell Hurree Babu, and _whatt_ the deuce am I to do? And my old man is sick. I must tie up the letters in oilskin. That is something to do first\u2014else they will get all sweated ... And I am all alone!\u201d He bound them into a neat packet, swedging down the stiff, sticky oilskin at the corners, for his roving life had made him as methodical as an old hunter in matters of the road. Then with double care he packed away the books at the bottom of the food-bag.\n\nThe woman rapped at the door.\n\n\u201cBut thou hast made no charm,\u201d she said, looking about."

  "Herman Melville -- Moby-Dick; or, The Whale": [
    "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago\u2014never mind how long precisely\u2014having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people\u2019s hats off\u2014then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n\n\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs\u2014commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n\n\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall northward. What do you see?\u2014Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster\u2014tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?\n\n\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand\u2014miles of them\u2014leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues,\u2014north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?\n\n\nOnce more. Say, you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries\u2014stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.\n\n\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd\u2019s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd\u2019s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies\u2014what is the one charm wanting?\u2014Water\u2014there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\n\n\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick\u2014grow quarrelsome\u2014don\u2019t sleep of nights\u2014do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;\u2014no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,\u2014though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board\u2014yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;\u2014though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\n\n\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one\u2019s sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from the schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.\n\n\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who aint a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about\u2014however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way\u2014either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other\u2019s shoulder-blades, and be content.\n\n\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being paid_,\u2014what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\n\n\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way\u2014he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:\n\n\n\u201c_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._\n\u201cWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.\n\u201cBLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\u201d\n\n\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces\u2014though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.\n\n\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it\u2014would they let me\u2014since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.\n\n\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.",
    "Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense. \u201cStarboard gangway, there! side away to larboard\u2014larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!\u201d\n\n\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still slighter shuffling of women\u2019s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every eye on the preacher.\n\n\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit\u2019s bows, folded his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea.\n\n\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog\u2014in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy\u2014\n\n\u201cThe ribs and terrors in the whale,\n    Arched over me a dismal gloom,\nWhile all God\u2019s sun-lit waves rolled by,\n    And lift me deepening down to doom.\n\n\u201cI saw the opening maw of hell,\n    With endless pains and sorrows there;\nWhich none but they that feel can tell\u2014\n    Oh, I was plunging to despair.\n\n\u201cIn black distress, I called my God,\n    When I could scarce believe him mine,\nHe bowed his ear to my complaints\u2014\n    No more the whale did me confine.\n\n\u201cWith speed he flew to my relief,\n    As on a radiant dolphin borne;\nAwful, yet bright, as lightning shone\n    The face of my Deliverer God.\n\n\u201cMy song for ever shall record\n    That terrible, that joyful hour;\nI give the glory to my God,\n    His all the mercy and the power.\u201d\n\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said: \u201cBeloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah\u2014\u201cAnd God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShipmates, this book, containing only four chapters\u2014four yarns\u2014is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah\u2019s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish\u2019s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_ is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God\u2014never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed\u2014which he found a hard command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do\u2014remember that\u2014and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.\n\n\n\u201cWith this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men, will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that\u2019s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz. That\u2019s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he\u2019s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,\u2014no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger\u2019s evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other\u2014\u2018Jack, he\u2019s robbed a widow;\u2019 or, \u2018Joe, do you mark him; he\u2019s a bigamist;\u2019 or, \u2018Harry lad, I guess he\u2019s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.\u2019 Another runs to read the bill that\u2019s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.\n\n\n\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his papers for the Customs\u2014\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 Oh! how that harmless question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But he rallies. \u2018I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?\u2019 Thus far the busy captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. \u2018We sail with the next coming tide,\u2019 at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. \u2018No sooner, sir?\u2019\u2014\u2018Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.\u2019 Ha! Jonah, that\u2019s another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. \u2018I\u2019ll sail with ye,\u2019\u2014he says,\u2014\u2018the passage money, how much is that,\u2014I\u2019ll pay now.\u2019 For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, \u2018that he paid the fare thereof\u2019 ere the craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.\n\n\nNow Jonah\u2019s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So Jonah\u2019s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah\u2019s purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it\u2019s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. \u2018Point out my state-room, Sir,\u2019 says Jonah now. \u2018I\u2019m travel-weary; I need sleep.\u2019 \u2018Thou look\u2019st like it,\u2019 says the Captain, \u2018there\u2019s thy room.\u2019 Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of convicts\u2019 cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship\u2019s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowel\u2019s wards.\n\n\n\u201cScrewed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah\u2019s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. \u2018Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!\u2019 he groans, \u2018straight upward, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!\u2019\n\n\n\u201cLike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there\u2019s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah\u2019s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.\n\n\n\u201cAnd now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah\u2019s head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship\u2014a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear, \u2018What meanest thou, O sleeper! arise!\u2019 Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.\n\n\n\u201cTerrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah\u2019s; that discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions. \u2018What is thine occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people?\u2019 But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.\n\n\n\u2018I am a Hebrew,\u2019 he cries\u2014and then\u2014\u2018I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!\u2019 Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,\u2014when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not unrel",
    "It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the garden. Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints\u2014the foot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought. But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.\n\n\n\u201cD\u2019ye mark him, Flask?\u201d whispered Stubb; \u201cthe chick that\u2019s in him pecks the shell. \u2019Twill soon be out.\u201d\n\n\nThe hours wore on;\u2014Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect. It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.\n\n\n\u201cSir!\u201d said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship-board except in some extraordinary case.\n\n\n\u201cSend everybody aft,\u201d repeated Ahab. \u201cMast-heads, there! come down!\u201d\n\n\nWhen the entire ship\u2019s company were assembled, and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:\u2014\n\n\n\u201cWhat do ye do when ye see a whale, men?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSing out for him!\u201d was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices.\n\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them.\n\n\n\u201cAnd what do ye next, men?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLower away, and after him!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd what tune is it ye pull to, men?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA dead whale or a stove boat!\u201d\n\n\nMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions. But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:\u2014\n\n\n\u201cAll ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale. Look ye! d\u2019ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?\u201d\u2014holding up a broad bright coin to the sun\u2014\u201cit is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D\u2019ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\u201d\n\n\nWhile the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him. Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \u201cWhosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke\u2014look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHuzza! huzza!\u201d cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a white whale, I say,\u201d resumed Ahab, as he threw down the top-maul; \u201ca white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\u201d\n\n\nAll this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection.\n\n\n\u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Tashtego, \u201cthat white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMoby Dick?\u201d shouted Ahab. \u201cDo ye know the white whale then, Tash?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoes he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\u201d said the Gay-Header deliberately.\n\n\n\u201cAnd has he a curious spout,\u201d too, said Daggoo, \u201cvery bushy, even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd he have one, two, tree\u2014oh! good many iron in him hide, too, Captain,\u201d cried Queequeg disjointedly, \u201call twiske-tee betwisk, like him\u2014him\u2014\u201d faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle\u2014\u201clike him\u2014him\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCorkscrew!\u201d cried Ahab, \u201caye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen\u2014Moby Dick\u2014Moby Dick!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. \u201cCaptain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick\u2014but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho told thee that?\u201d cried Ahab; then pausing, \u201cAye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\u201d he shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; \u201cAye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\u201d Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out: \u201cAye, aye! and I\u2019ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition\u2019s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAye, aye!\u201d shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the excited old man: \u201cA sharp eye for the White Whale; a sharp lance for Moby Dick!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod bless ye,\u201d he seemed to half sob and half shout. \u201cGod bless ye, men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what\u2019s this long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for Moby Dick?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came here to hunt whales, not my commander\u2019s vengeance. How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a little lower layer. If money\u2019s to be the measurer, man, and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here!_\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe smites his chest,\u201d whispered Stubb, \u201cwhat\u2019s that for? methinks it rings most vast, but hollow.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cVengeance on a dumb brute!\u201d cried Starbuck, \u201cthat simply smote thee from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHark ye yet again,\u2014the little lower layer. All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event\u2014in the living act, the undoubted deed\u2014there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there\u2019s naught beyond. But \u2019tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I\u2019d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even that fair play. Who\u2019s over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends\u2019 glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn\u2014living, breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan leopards\u2014the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. \u2019Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee! Speak, but speak!\u2014Aye, aye! thy silence, then, _that_ voices thee. (_aside_) something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without rebellion.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod keep me!\u2014keep us all!\u201d murmured Starbuck, lowly.\n\n\nBut in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in. For again Starbuck\u2019s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things within. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these still drive us on.\n\n\n\u201cThe measure! the measure!\u201d cried Ahab.",
    "The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain\u2019s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning his ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;\u2014a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.\n\n\nWhile yet the wondering ship\u2019s company were gazing upon these strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, \u201cAll ready there, Fedallah?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReady,\u201d was the half-hissed reply.\n\n\n\u201cLower away then; d\u2019ye hear?\u201d shouting across the deck. \u201cLower away there, I say.\u201d\n\n\nSuch was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship\u2019s side into the tossed boats below.\n\n\nHardly had they pulled out from under the ship\u2019s lee, when a fourth keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.\n\n\n\u201cCaptain Ahab?\u201d\u2014said Starbuck.\n\n\n\u201cSpread yourselves,\u201d cried Ahab; \u201cgive way, all four boats. Thou, Flask, pull out more to leeward!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAye, aye, sir,\u201d cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great steering oar. \u201cLay back!\u201d addressing his crew. \u201cThere!\u2014there!\u2014there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!\u2014lay back!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNever heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind \u2019em, sir,\u201d said Archy; \u201cI knew it all before now. Didn\u2019t I hear \u2019em in the hold? And didn\u2019t I tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little ones,\u201d drawingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you break your backbones, my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are only five more hands come to help us\u2014never mind from where\u2014the more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone\u2014devils are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that\u2019s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that\u2019s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men\u2014all hearts alive! Easy, easy; don\u2019t be in a hurry\u2014don\u2019t be in a hurry. Why don\u2019t you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so, then;\u2014softly, softly! That\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s it! long and strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can\u2019t ye? pull, won\u2019t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don\u2019t ye pull?\u2014pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out! Here!\u201d whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; \u201cevery mother\u2019s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth. That\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my steel-bits. Start her\u2014start her, my silver-spoons! Start her, marling-spikes!\u201d\n\n\nStubb\u2019s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped\u2014open-mouthed at times\u2014that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.\n\n\nIn obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubb\u2019s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.\n\n\n\u201cMr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye please!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHalloa!\u201d returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set like a flint from Stubb\u2019s.\n\n\n\u201cWhat think ye of those yellow boys, sir!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSmuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong, boys!\u201d) in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: \u201cA sad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There\u2019s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that\u2019s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm\u2019s the play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAye, aye, I thought as much,\u201d soliloquized Stubb, when the boats diverged, \u201cas soon as I clapt eye on \u2019em, I thought so. Aye, and that\u2019s what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale\u2019s at the bottom of it. Well, well, so be it! Can\u2019t be helped! All right! Give way, men! It ain\u2019t the White Whale to-day! Give way!\u201d\n\n\nNow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship\u2019s company; but Archy\u2019s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some small measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb\u2019s confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab\u2019s precise agency in the matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.\n\n\nMeantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whale-bone; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer\u2019s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip: Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All at once the out-stretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed, while the boat\u2019s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.\n\n\n\u201cEvery man look out along his oars!\u201d cried Starbuck. \u201cThou, Queequeg, stand up!\u201d",
    "Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days\u2019 sail westward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.\n\n\nThough no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance favored, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Lakeman!\u2014Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?\u2019 said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\n\n\n\u201cOn the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but\u2014I crave your courtesy\u2014may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now, gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla; this lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours\u2014Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,\u2014possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the ocean\u2019s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave\u2019s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt\u2014but, gentlemen, you shall hear.\n\n\n\u201cIt was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho\u2019s leak seemed again increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.\n\n\n\u201cMuch this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen\u2014that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.\n\n\n\u201cNow, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours\u2014watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern\u2019s tower, and make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy\u2019s snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne\u2019s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.\n\n\n\u201cEspying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his gay banterings.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Aye, aye, my merry lads, it\u2019s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one of ye, and let\u2019s have a taste. By the Lord, it\u2019s worth bottling! I tell ye what, men, old Rad\u2019s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he\u2019s come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of \u2019em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I\u2019d tell him to jump overboard and scatter \u2019em. They\u2019re playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him. But he\u2019s a simple old soul,\u2014Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he\u2019d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Damn your eyes! what\u2019s that pump stopping for?\u2019 roared Radney, pretending not to have heard the sailors\u2019 talk. \u2018Thunder away at it!\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Aye, aye, sir,\u2019 said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. \u2018Lively, boys, lively, now!\u2019 And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life\u2019s utmost energies.\n\n\n\u201cQuitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\"",
    "If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to Queequeg it was quite a different object. \u201cWhen you see him \u2019quid,\u201d said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat, \u201cthen you quick see him \u2019parm whale.\u201d\nThe next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to engage them, the Pequod\u2019s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.\nIt was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.\nEre forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizen mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.\n\nSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun\u2019s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some enchanter\u2019s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.\n\n\u201cClear away the boats! Luff!\u201d cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.\n\n\u201cThere go flukes!\u201d was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by Stubb\u2019s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker\u2019s boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.\n\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he was going \u201chead out\u201d; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed.\n\u201cStart her, start her, my men! Don\u2019t hurry yourselves; take plenty of time\u2014but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that\u2019s all,\u201d cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. \u201cStart her, now; give \u2019em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy\u2014start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool\u2014cucumbers is the word\u2014easy, easy\u2014only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys\u2014that\u2019s all. Start her!\u201d\n\n\u201cWoo-hoo! Wa-hee!\u201d screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave.\nBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. \u201cKee-hee! Kee-hee!\u201d yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.\n\n\u201cKa-la! Koo-loo!\u201d howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of Grenadier\u2019s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was heard\u2014\u201cStand up, Tashtego!\u2014give it to him!\u201d The harpoon was hurled. \u201cStern all!\u201d The oarsmen backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb\u2019s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy\u2019s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.\n\n\u201cWet the line! wet the line!\u201d cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed the sea-water into it.\nMore turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego here changed places\u2014stem for stern\u2014a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion.\nFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would have thought the craft had two keels\u2014one cleaving the water, the other the air\u2014as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight.\n\n\u201cHaul in\u2014haul in!\u201d cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale\u2019s horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another fling.\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.\n\n\u201cPull up\u2014pull up!\u201d he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath. \u201cPull up!\u2014close to!\u201d and the boat ranged along the fish\u2019s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his \u201cflurry,\u201d the monster horribly wallowed in his blood, over-wrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.",
    "With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there. By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.\n\nBut how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no sustenance but what\u2019s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake\u2019s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years\u2019 water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer\u2014\u201cWell, boys, here\u2019s the ark!\u201d\n\nNow, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.\n\nBut here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.\n\nBroad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top, falls over in two branches, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually rising and falling away to leeward.\n\nSeen from the Pequod\u2019s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.\n\nAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains, accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.\n\nCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our wake.\n\nCorresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, \u201cAloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails;\u2014Malays, sir, and after us!\u201d\n\nAs if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit,\u2014mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses;\u2014when all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab\u2019s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.",
    "It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the many noses on the Pequod\u2019s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.\n\n\u201cI will bet something now,\u201d said Stubb, \u201cthat somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they would keel up before long.\u201d\n\nPresently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colors from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose.\n\nComing still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted whales in general.\n\nThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he recognized his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty fellow, now,\u201d he banteringly laughed, standing in the ship\u2019s bows, \u201cthere\u2019s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get won\u2019t be enough to dip the Captain\u2019s wick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here\u2019s a Crappo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let\u2019s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity\u2019s sake. For what oil he\u2019ll get from that drugged whale there, wouldn\u2019t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I\u2019ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he\u2019ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It\u2019s worth trying. Yes, I\u2019m for it;\u201d and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.\n\nBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb now called his boat\u2019s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color. Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read \u201cBouton de Rose,\u201d\u2014Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.\n\nThough Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription, yet the word rose, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently explained the whole to him.\n\n\u201cA wooden rose-bud, eh?\u201d he cried with his hand to his nose, \u201cthat will do very well; but how like all creation it smells!\u201d\n\nNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.\n\nArrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled\u2014\u201cBouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the chief-mate.\n\n\u201cWell, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat whale?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White Whale\u2014a Sperm Whale\u2014Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale\u2014no.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good, then; good bye now, and I\u2019ll call again in a minute.\u201d\n\nThen rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted\u2014\u201cNo, Sir! No!\u201d Upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\n\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with your nose, there?\u201d said Stubb. \u201cBroke it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish it was broken, or that I didn\u2019t have any nose at all!\u201d answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much. \u201cBut what are you holding yours for?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, nothing! It\u2019s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, aint it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in the devil\u2019s name do you want here?\u201d roared the Guernsey-man, flying into a sudden passion.\n\n\u201cOh! keep cool\u2014cool? yes, that\u2019s the word; why don\u2019t you pack those whales in ice while you\u2019re working at \u2019em? But joking aside, though; do you know, Rose-bud, that it\u2019s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn\u2019t a gill in his whole carcase.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that well enough; but, d\u2019ye see, the Captain here won\u2019t believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But come aboard, and mayhap he\u2019ll believe you, if he won\u2019t me; and so I\u2019ll get out of this dirty scrape.\u201d",
    "THE DECK\u2014FIRST NIGHT WATCH\n\n(Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is firmly fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red flame of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work.)\n\nDrat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft, and that soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and shinbones. Let\u2019s try another. Aye, now, this works better (sneezes). Halloa, this bone dust is (sneezes)\u2014why it\u2019s (sneezes)\u2014yes it\u2019s (sneezes)\u2014bless my soul, it won\u2019t let me speak! This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you don\u2019t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don\u2019t get it (sneezes). Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let\u2019s have that ferule and buckle-screw; I\u2019ll be ready for them presently.

Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever (sneezes) scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I\u2019ve seen in shop windows wouldn\u2019t compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored (sneezes) with washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess. Ha! that\u2019s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it\u2019s somebody else, that\u2019s certain.\n\n\nAHAB (advancing).\n(During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues sneezing at times).\n\nWell, manmaker!\n\nJust in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length. Let me measure, sir.\n\nMeasured for a leg! good. Well, it\u2019s not the first time. About it! There; keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter; let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.\n\nOh, sir, it will break bones\u2014beware, beware!\n\nNo fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold, man. What\u2019s Prometheus about there?\u2014the blacksmith, I mean\u2014what\u2019s he about?\n\nHe must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.\n\nRight. It\u2019s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a fierce red flame there!\n\nAye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.\n\nUm-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what\u2019s made in fire must properly belong to fire; and so hell\u2019s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter, when he\u2019s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades; there\u2019s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.\n\nSir?\n\nHold; while Prometheus is about it, I\u2019ll order a complete man after a desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to \u2019em, to stay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me see\u2014shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.\n\nNow, what\u2019s he speaking about, and who\u2019s he speaking to, I should like to know? Shall I keep standing here? (aside).\n\n\u2019Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here\u2019s one. No, no, no; I must have a lantern.\n\nHo, ho! That\u2019s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.\n\nWhat art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man? Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.\n\nI thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.\n\nCarpenter? why that\u2019s\u2014but no;\u2014a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;\u2014or would\u2019st thou rather work in clay?\n\nSir?\u2014Clay? clay, sir? That\u2019s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.\n\nThe fellow\u2019s impious! What art thou sneezing about?\n\nBone is rather dusty, sir.\n\nTake the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under living people\u2019s noses.\n\nSir?\u2014oh! ah!\u2014I guess so; so;\u2014yes, yes\u2014oh dear!\n\nLook ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman, eh! Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive that old Adam away?\n\nTruly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?\n\nIt is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair, do I. Is\u2019t a riddle?\n\nI should humbly call it a poser, sir.\n\nHist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don\u2019t speak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayest not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!\n\nGood Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again; I think I didn\u2019t carry a small figure, sir.\n\nLook ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.\u2014How long before this leg is done?\n\nPerhaps an hour, sir.\n\nBungle away at it then, and bring it to me (turns to go). Oh, Life! Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers. I would be free as air; and I\u2019m down in the whole world\u2019s books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Pr\u00e6torians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was the world\u2019s); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By heavens! I\u2019ll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one small, compendious vertebra. So.",
    "That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man\u2014as his wont at intervals\u2014stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship\u2019s dog will, in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship\u2019s course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.\n\nThe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.\n\n\u201cMan the mast-heads! Call all hands!\u201d\n\nThundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019ye see?\u201d cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing, sir!\u201d was the sound hailing down in reply.\n\n\u201cT\u2019gallant sails!\u2014stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!\u201d\n\nAll sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the air, \u201cThere she blows!\u2014there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!\u201d\n\nFired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant mast, so that the Indian\u2019s head was almost on a level with Ahab\u2019s heel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\n\n\u201cAnd did none of ye see it before?\u201d cried Ahab, hailing the perched men all around him.\n\n\u201cI saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I cried out,\u201d said Tashtego.\n\n\u201cNot the same instant; not the same\u2014no, the doubloon is mine, Fate reserved the doubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised the White Whale first. There she blows! there she blows!\u2014there she blows! There again!\u2014there again!\u201d he cried, in long-drawn, lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale\u2019s visible jets. \u201cHe\u2019s going to sound! In stunsails! Down top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,\u2014quick, quicker!\u201d and he slid through the air to the deck.\n\n\u201cHe is heading straight to leeward, sir,\u201d cried Stubb, \u201cright away from us; cannot have seen the ship yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!\u2014brace up! Shiver her!\u2014shiver her! So; well that! Boats, boats!\u201d\n\nSoon all the boats but Starbuck\u2019s were dropped; all the boat-sails set\u2014all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah\u2019s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\n\nLike noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea; but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale\u2019s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\n\n\nA gentle joyousness\u2014a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.\n\nOn each soft side\u2014coincident with the parted swell, that but once leaving him, then flowed so wide away\u2014on each bright side, the whale shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way thou may\u2019st have bejuggled and destroyed before.\n\nAnd thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia\u2019s Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\n\nWith oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick\u2019s reappearance.",
    "The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.\n\n\u201cD\u2019ye see him?\u201d cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.\n\n\u201cIn his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that\u2019s all. Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day again; were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here\u2019s food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; that\u2019s tingling enough for mortal man! to think\u2019s audacity. God only has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for that. And yet, I\u2019ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm\u2014frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it\u2019s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!\u2014it\u2019s tainted. Were I the wind, I\u2019d blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I\u2019d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink there. And yet, \u2019tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing\u2014a nobler thing than that. Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as agents. There\u2019s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there\u2019s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like them\u2014something so unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d\u2019ye see?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun! Aye, aye, it must be so. I\u2019ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye, he\u2019s chasing me now; not I, him\u2014that\u2019s bad; I might have known it, too. Fool! the lines\u2014the harpoons he\u2019s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look outs! Man the braces!\u201d\n\nSteering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod\u2019s quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake.\n\n\u201cAgainst the wind he now steers for the open jaw,\u201d murmured Starbuck to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. \u201cGod keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!\u201d\n\n\u201cStand by to sway me up!\u201d cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket. \u201cWe should meet him soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, aye, sir,\u201d and straightway Starbuck did Ahab\u2019s bidding, and once more Ahab swung on high.\n\nA whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.\n\n\u201cForehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck there!\u2014brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind\u2019s eye. He\u2019s too far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there\u2019s time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!\u2014the same!\u2014the same to Noah as to me. There\u2019s a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere\u2014to something else than common land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What\u2019s this?\u2014green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab\u2019s head! There\u2019s the difference now between man\u2019s old age and matter\u2019s. But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg, that\u2019s all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way. I can\u2019t compare with it; and I\u2019ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers. What\u2019s that he said? he should still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all night I\u2019ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye, aye, like many more thou told\u2019st direful truth as touching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good by, mast-head\u2014keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I\u2019m gone. We\u2019ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.\u201d\n\nHe gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck."

  "Baroness Emmuska Orczy Orczy -- El Dorado: An Adventure of the Scarlet Pimpernel": [
    "And yet people found the opportunity to amuse themselves, to dance and to go to the theatre, to enjoy music and open-air cafes and promenades in the Palais Royal. New fashions in dress made their appearance, milliners produced fresh \u201ccreations,\u201d and jewellers were not idle. A grim sense of humour, born of the very intensity of ever-present danger, had dubbed the cut of certain tunics \u201ctete tranche,\u201d or a favourite ragout was called \u201ca la guillotine.\u201d\n\nOn three evenings only during the past memorable four and a half years did the theatres close their doors, and these evenings were the ones immediately following that terrible 2nd of September the day of the butchery outside the Abbaye prison, when Paris herself was aghast with horror, and the cries of the massacred might have drowned the calls of the audience whose hands upraised for plaudits would still be dripping with blood. On all other evenings of these same four and a half years the theatres in the Rue de Richelieu, in the Palais Royal, the Luxembourg, and others, had raised their curtains and taken money at their doors. The same audience that earlier in the day had whiled away the time by witnessing the ever-recurrent dramas of the Place de la Revolution assembled here in the evenings and filled stalls, boxes, and tiers, laughing over the satires of Voltaire or weeping over the sentimental tragedies of persecuted Romeos and innocent Juliets.\n\nDeath knocked at so many doors these days! He was so constant a guest in the houses of relatives and friends that those who had merely shaken him by the hand, those on whom he had smiled, and whom he, still smiling, had passed indulgently by, looked on him with that subtle contempt born of familiarity, shrugged their shoulders at his passage, and envisaged his probable visit on the morrow with lighthearted indifference.\n\nParis--despite the horrors that had stained her walls had remained a city of pleasure, and the knife of the guillotine did scarce descend more often than did the drop-scenes on the stage.\n\nOn this bitterly cold evening of the 27th Nivose, in the second year of the Republic--or, as we of the old style still persist in calling it, the 16th of January, 1794--the auditorium of the Theatre National was filled with a very brilliant company. The appearance of a favourite actress in the part of one of Moliere\u2019s volatile heroines had brought pleasure-loving Paris to witness this revival of \u201cLe Misanthrope,\u201d with new scenery, dresses, and the aforesaid charming actress to add piquancy to the master\u2019s mordant wit.\n\nThe Moniteur, which so impartially chronicles the events of those times, tells us under that date that the Assembly of the Convention voted on that same day a new law giving fuller power to its spies, enabling them to effect domiciliary searches at their discretion without previous reference to the Committee of General Security, authorising them to proceed against all enemies of public happiness, to send them to prison at their own discretion, and assuring them the sum of thirty-five livres \u201cfor every piece of game thus beaten up for the guillotine.\u201d Under that same date the Moniteur also puts it on record that the Theatre National was filled to its utmost capacity for the revival of the late citoyen Moliere\u2019s comedy.\n\nThe Assembly of the Convention having voted the new law which placed the lives of thousands at the mercy of a few human bloodhounds, adjourned its sitting and proceeded to the Rue de Richelieu.\n\nAlready the house was full when the fathers of the people made their way to the seats which had been reserved for them. An awed hush descended on the throng as one by one the men whose very names inspired horror and dread filed in through the narrow gangways of the stalls or took their places in the tiny boxes around.\n\nCitizen Robespierre\u2019s neatly bewigged head soon appeared in one of these; his bosom friend St. Just was with him, and also his sister Charlotte. Danton, like a big, shaggy-coated lion, elbowed his way into the stalls, whilst Sauterre, the handsome butcher and idol of the people of Paris, was loudly acclaimed as his huge frame, gorgeously clad in the uniform of the National Guard, was sighted on one of the tiers above.\n\nThe public in the parterre and in the galleries whispered excitedly; the awe-inspiring names flew about hither and thither on the wings of the overheated air. Women craned their necks to catch sight of heads which mayhap on the morrow would roll into the gruesome basket at the foot of the guillotine.\n\nIn one of the tiny avant-scene boxes two men had taken their seats long before the bulk of the audience had begun to assemble in the house. The inside of the box was in complete darkness, and the narrow opening which allowed but a sorry view of one side of the stage helped to conceal rather than display the occupants.\n\nThe younger one of these two men appeared to be something of a stranger in Paris, for as the public men and the well-known members of the Government began to arrive he often turned to his companion for information regarding these notorious personalities.\n\n\u201cTell me, de Batz,\u201d he said, calling the other\u2019s attention to a group of men who had just entered the house, \u201cthat creature there in the green coat--with his hand up to his face now--who is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere? Which do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere! He looks this way now, and he has a playbill in his hand. The man with the protruding chin and the convex forehead, a face like a marmoset, and eyes like a jackal. What?\u201d\n\nThe other leaned over the edge of the box, and his small, restless eyes wandered over the now closely-packed auditorium.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d he said as soon as he recognised the face which his friend had pointed out to him, \u201cthat is citizen Foucquier-Tinville.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Public Prosecutor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHimself. And Heron is the man next to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeron?\u201d said the younger man interrogatively.\n\n\u201cYes. He is chief agent to the Committee of General Security now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\nBoth leaned back in their chairs, and their sombrely-clad figures were once more merged in the gloom of the narrow box. Instinctively, since the name of the Public Prosecutor had been mentioned between them, they had allowed their voices to sink to a whisper.",
    "The ground beneath de Batz\u2019 feet was hard and white with the frost. Overhead the pale, wintry moon looked down serene and placid on this giant city wallowing in an ocean of misery.\n\nThere had been but little snow as yet this year, and the cold was intense. On his right now the Cimetiere des SS. Innocents lay peaceful and still beneath the wan light of the moon. A thin covering of snow lay evenly alike on grass mounds and smooth stones. Here and there a broken cross with chipped arms still held pathetically outstretched, as if in a final appeal for human love, bore mute testimony to senseless excesses and spiteful desire for destruction.\n\nBut here within the precincts of the dwelling of the eternal Master a solemn silence reigned; only the cold north wind shook the branches of the yew, causing them to send forth a melancholy sigh into the night, and to shed a shower of tiny crystals of snow like the frozen tears of the dead.\n\nAnd round the precincts of the lonely graveyard, and down narrow streets or open places, the night watchmen went their rounds, lanthorn in hand, and every five minutes their monotonous call rang clearly out in the night:\n\n\u201cSleep, citizens! everything is quiet and at peace!\u201d\n\nWe may take it that de Batz did not philosophise over-much on what went on around him. He had walked swiftly up the Rue St. Martin, then turning sharply to his right he found himself beneath the tall, frowning walls of the Temple prison, the grim guardian of so many secrets, such terrible despair, such unspeakable tragedies.\n\nHere, too, as in the Place de la Revolution, an intermittent roll of muffled drums proclaimed the ever-watchful presence of the National Guard. But with that exception not a sound stirred round the grim and stately edifice; there were no cries, no calls, no appeals around its walls. All the crying and wailing was shut in by the massive stone that told no tales.\n\nDim and flickering lights shone behind several of the small windows in the facade of the huge labyrinthine building. Without any hesitation de Batz turned down the Rue du Temple, and soon found himself in front of the main gates which gave on the courtyard beyond. The sentinel challenged him, but he had the pass-word, and explained that he desired to have speech with citizen Heron.\n\nWith a surly gesture the guard pointed to the heavy bell-pull up against the gate, and de Batz pulled it with all his might. The long clang of the brazen bell echoed and re-echoed round the solid stone walls. Anon a tiny judas in the gate was cautiously pushed open, and a peremptory voice once again challenged the midnight intruder.\n\nDe Batz, more peremptorily this time, asked for citizen Heron, with whom he had immediate and important business, and a glimmer of a piece of silver which he held up close to the judas secured him the necessary admittance.\n\nThe massive gates slowly swung open on their creaking hinges, and as de Batz passed beneath the archway they closed again behind him.\n\nThe concierge\u2019s lodge was immediately on his left. Again he was challenged, and again gave the pass-word. But his face was apparently known here, for no serious hindrance to proceed was put in his way.\n\nA man, whose wide, lean frame was but ill-covered by a threadbare coat and ragged breeches, and with soleless shoes on his feet, was told off to direct the citoyen to citizen Heron\u2019s rooms. The man walked slowly along with bent knees and arched spine, and shuffled his feet as he walked; the bunch of keys which he carried rattled ominously in his long, grimy hands; the passages were badly lighted, and he also carried a lanthorn to guide himself on the way.\n\nClosely followed by de Batz, he soon turned into the central corridor, which is open to the sky above, and was spectrally alight now with flag-stones and walls gleaming beneath the silvery sheen of the moon, and throwing back the fantastic elongated shadows of the two men as they walked.\n\nOn the left, heavily barred windows gave on the corridor, as did here and there the massive oaken doors, with their gigantic hinges and bolts, on the steps of which squatted groups of soldiers wrapped in their cloaks, with wild, suspicious eyes beneath their capotes, peering at the midnight visitor as he passed.\n\nThere was no thought of silence here. The very walls seemed alive with sounds, groans and tears, loud wails and murmured prayers; they exuded from the stones and trembled on the frost-laden air.\n\nOccasionally at one of the windows a pair of white hands would appear, grasping the heavy iron bar, trying to shake it in its socket, and mayhap, above the hands, the dim vision of a haggard face, a man\u2019s or a woman\u2019s, trying to get a glimpse of the outside world, a final look at the sky, before the last journey to the place of death to-morrow. Then one of the soldiers, with a loud, angry oath, would struggle to his feet, and with the butt-end of his gun strike at the thin, wan fingers till their hold on the iron bar relaxed, and the pallid face beyond would sink back into the darkness with a desperate cry of pain.\n\nA quick, impatient sigh escaped de Batz\u2019 lips. He had skirted the wide courtyard in the wake of his guide, and from where he was he could see the great central tower, with its tiny windows lighted from within, the grim walls behind which the descendant of the world\u2019s conquerors, the bearer of the proudest name in Europe, and wearer of its most ancient crown, had spent the last days of his brilliant life in abject shame, sorrow, and degradation. The memory had swiftly surged up before him of that night when he all but rescued King Louis and his family from this same miserable prison: the guard had been bribed, the keeper corrupted, everything had been prepared, save the reckoning with the one irresponsible factor--chance!",
    "\u201cYesterday you were unkind and ungallant. How could I smile when you seemed so stern?\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday I was not alone with you. How could I say what lay next my heart, when indifferent ears could catch the words that were meant only for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, monsieur, do they teach you in England how to make pretty speeches?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, mademoiselle, that is an instinct that comes into birth by the fire of a woman\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nMademoiselle Lange was sitting upon a small sofa of antique design, with cushions covered in faded silks heaped round her pretty head. Armand thought that she looked like that carved cameo which his sister Marguerite possessed.\n\nHe himself sat on a low chair at some distance from her. He had brought her a large bunch of early violets, for he knew that she was fond of flowers, and these lay upon her lap, against the opalescent grey of her gown.\n\nShe seemed a little nervous and agitated, his obvious admiration bringing a ready blush to her cheeks.\n\nThe room itself appeared to Armand to be a perfect frame for the charming picture which she presented. The furniture in it was small and old; tiny tables of antique Vernis-Martin, softly faded tapestries, a pale-toned Aubusson carpet. Everything mellow and in a measure pathetic. Mademoiselle Lange, who was an orphan, lived alone under the duennaship of a middle-aged relative, a penniless hanger-on of the successful young actress, who acted as her chaperone, housekeeper, and maid, and kept unseemly or over-bold gallants at bay.\n\nShe told Armand all about her early life, her childhood in the backshop of Maitre Meziere, the jeweller, who was a relative of her mother\u2019s; of her desire for an artistic career, her struggles with the middle-class prejudices of her relations, her bold defiance of them, and final independence.\n\nShe made no secret of her humble origin, her want of education in those days; on the contrary, she was proud of what she had accomplished for herself. She was only twenty years of age, and already held a leading place in the artistic world of Paris.\n\nArmand listened to her chatter, interested in everything she said, questioning her with sympathy and discretion. She asked him a good deal about himself, and about his beautiful sister Marguerite, who, of course, had been the most brilliant star in that most brilliant constellation, the Comedie Francaise. She had never seen Marguerite St. Just act, but, of course, Paris still rang with her praises, and all art-lovers regretted that she should have married and left them to mourn for her.\n\nThus the conversation drifted naturally back to England. Mademoiselle professed a vast interest in the citizen\u2019s country of adoption.\n\n\u201cI had always,\u201d she said, \u201cthought it an ugly country, with the noise and bustle of industrial life going on everywhere, and smoke and fog to cover the landscape and to stunt the trees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, in future, mademoiselle,\u201d he replied, \u201cmust you think of it as one carpeted with verdure, where in the spring the orchard trees covered with delicate blossom would speak to you of fairyland, where the dewy grass stretches its velvety surface in the shadow of ancient monumental oaks, and ivy-covered towers rear their stately crowns to the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Scarlet Pimpernel? Tell me about him, monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, mademoiselle, what can I tell you that you do not already know? The Scarlet Pimpernel is a man who has devoted his entire existence to the benefit of suffering mankind. He has but one thought, and that is for those who need him; he hears but one sound the cry of the oppressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they do say, monsieur, that philanthropy plays but a sorry part in your hero\u2019s schemes. They aver that he looks on his own efforts and the adventures through which he goes only in the light of sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike all Englishmen, mademoiselle, the Scarlet Pimpernel is a little ashamed of sentiment. He would deny its very existence with his lips, even whilst his noble heart brimmed over with it. Sport? Well! mayhap the sporting instinct is as keen as that of charity--the race for lives, the tussle for the rescue of human creatures, the throwing of a life on the hazard of a die.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey fear him in France, monsieur. He has saved so many whose death had been decreed by the Committee of Public Safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease God, he will save many yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, monsieur, the poor little boy in the Temple prison!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has your sympathy, mademoiselle?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf every right-minded woman in France, monsieur. Oh!\u201d she added with a pretty gesture of enthusiasm, clasping her hands together, and looking at Armand with large eyes filled with tears, \u201cif your noble Scarlet Pimpernel will do aught to save that poor innocent lamb, I would indeed bless him in my heart, and help him with all my humble might if I could.\u201d",
    "\u201cLa!\u201d he said lightly, \u201con one point I am not at all in the dark, and that is that His Majesty King Louis XVII will come out of that ugly house in my company next Sunday, the nineteenth day of January in this year of grace seventeen hundred and ninety-four; and this, too, do I know--that those murderous blackguards shall not lay hands on me whilst that precious burden is in my keeping. So I pray you, my good Armand, do not look so glum,\u201d he added with his pleasant, merry laugh; \u201cyou\u2019ll need all your wits about you to help us in our undertaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you wish me to do, Percy?\u201d said the young man simply.\n\n\u201cIn one moment I will tell you. I want you all to understand the situation first. The child will be out of the Temple on Sunday, but at what hour I know not. The later it will be the better would it suit my purpose, for I cannot get him out of Paris before evening with any chance of safety. Here we must risk nothing; the child is far better off as he is now than he would be if he were dragged back after an abortive attempt at rescue. But at this hour of the night, between nine and ten o\u2019clock, I can arrange to get him out of Paris by the Villette gate, and that is where I want you, Ffoulkes, and you, Tony, to be, with some kind of covered cart, yourselves in any disguise your ingenuity will suggest. Here are a few certificates of safety; I have been making a collection of them for some time, as they are always useful.\u201d\n\nHe dived into the wide pocket of his coat and drew forth a number of cards, greasy, much-fingered documents of the usual pattern which the Committee of General Security delivered to the free citizens of the new republic, and without which no one could enter or leave any town or country commune without being detained as \u201csuspect.\u201d He glanced at them and handed them over to Ffoulkes.\n\n\u201cChoose your own identity for the occasion, my good friend,\u201d he said lightly; \u201cand you too, Tony. You may be stonemasons or coal-carriers, chimney-sweeps or farm-labourers, I care not which so long as you look sufficiently grimy and wretched to be unrecognisable, and so long as you can procure a cart without arousing suspicions, and can wait for me punctually at the appointed spot.\u201d\n\nFfoulkes turned over the cards, and with a laugh handed them over to Lord Tony. The two fastidious gentlemen discussed for awhile the respective merits of a chimney-sweep\u2019s uniform as against that of a coal-carrier.\n\n\u201cYou can carry more grime if you are a sweep,\u201d suggested Blakeney; \u201cand if the soot gets into your eyes it does not make them smart like coal does.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut soot adheres more closely,\u201d argued Tony solemnly, \u201cand I know that we shan\u2019t get a bath for at least a week afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly you won\u2019t, you sybarite!\u201d asserted Sir Percy with a laugh.\n\n\u201cAfter a week soot might become permanent,\u201d mused Sir Andrew, wondering what, under the circumstance, my lady would say to him.\n\n\u201cIf you are both so fastidious,\u201d retorted Blakeney, shrugging his broad shoulders, \u201cI\u2019ll turn one of you into a reddleman, and the other into a dyer. Then one of you will be bright scarlet to the end of his days, as the reddle never comes off the skin at all, and the other will have to soak in turpentine before the dye will consent to move.... In either case... oh, my dear Tony!... the smell....\u201d\n\nHe laughed like a schoolboy in anticipation of a prank, and held his scented handkerchief to his nose. My Lord Hastings chuckled audibly, and Tony punched him for this unseemly display of mirth.\n\nArmand watched the little scene in utter amazement. He had been in England over a year, and yet he could not understand these Englishmen. Surely they were the queerest, most inconsequent people in the world. Here were these men, who were engaged at this very moment in an enterprise which for cool-headed courage and foolhardy daring had probably no parallel in history. They were literally taking their lives in their hands, in all probability facing certain death; and yet they now sat chaffing and fighting like a crowd of third-form schoolboys, talking utter, silly nonsense, and making foolish jokes that would have shamed a Frenchman in his teens. Vaguely he wondered what fat, pompous de Batz would think of this discussion if he could overhear it. His contempt, no doubt, for the Scarlet Pimpernel and his followers would be increased tenfold.\n\nThen at last the question of the disguise was effectually dismissed. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Anthony Dewhurst had settled their differences of opinion by solemnly agreeing to represent two over-grimy and overheated coal-heavers. They chose two certificates of safety that were made out in the names of Jean Lepetit and Achille Grospierre, labourers.\n\n\u201cThough you don\u2019t look at all like an Achille, Tony,\u201d was Blakeney\u2019s parting shot to his friend.\n\nThen without any transition from this schoolboy nonsense to the serious business of the moment, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes said abruptly:\n\n\u201cTell us exactly, Blakeney, where you will want the cart to stand on Sunday.\u201d\n\nBlakeney rose and turned to the map against the wall, Ffoulkes and Tony following him. They stood close to his elbow whilst his slender, nervy hand wandered along the shiny surface of the varnished paper. At last he placed his finger on one spot.\n\n\u201cHere you see,\u201d he said, \u201cis the Villette gate. Just outside it a narrow street on the right leads down in the direction of the canal. It is just at the bottom of that narrow street at its junction with the tow-path there that I want you two and the cart to be. It had better be a coal-car by the way; they will be unloading coal close by there to-morrow,\u201d he added with one of his sudden irrepressible outbursts of merriment. \u201cYou and Tony can exercise your muscles coal-heaving, and incidentally make yourselves known in the neighbourhood as good if somewhat grimy patriots.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had better take up our parts at once then,\u201d said Tony. \u201cI\u2019ll take a fond farewell of my clean shirt to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you will not see one again for some time, my good Tony. After your hard day\u2019s work to-morrow you will have to sleep either inside your cart, if you have already secured one, or under the arches of the canal bridge, if you have not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope you have an equally pleasant prospect for Hastings,\u201d was my Lord Tony\u2019s grim comment.",
    "\u201cWell, now, Armand, what is it?\u201d asked Blakeney, the moment the footsteps of his friends had died away down the stone stairs, and their voices had ceased to echo in the distance.\n\n\u201cYou guessed, then, that there was... something?\u201d said the younger man, after a slight hesitation.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nArmand rose, pushing the chair away from him with an impatient nervy gesture. Burying his hands in the pockets of his breeches, he began striding up and down the room, a dark, troubled expression in his face, a deep frown between his eyes.\n\nBlakeney had once more taken up his favourite position, sitting on the corner of the table, his broad shoulders interposed between the lamp and the rest of the room. He was apparently taking no notice of Armand, but only intent on the delicate operation of polishing his nails.\n\nSuddenly the young man paused in his restless walk and stood in front of his friend--an earnest, solemn, determined figure.\n\n\u201cBlakeney,\u201d he said, \u201cI cannot leave Paris to-morrow.\u201d\n\nSir Percy made no reply. He was contemplating the polish which he had just succeeded in producing on his thumbnail.\n\n\u201cI must stay here for a while longer,\u201d continued Armand firmly. \u201cI may not be able to return to England for some weeks. You have the three others here to help you in your enterprise outside Paris. I am entirely at your service within the compass of its walls.\u201d\n\nStill no comment from Blakeney, not a look from beneath the fallen lids. Armand continued, with a slight tone of impatience apparent in his voice:\n\n\u201cYou must want some one to help you here on Sunday. I am entirely at your service... here or anywhere in Paris... but I cannot leave this city... at any rate, not just yet....\u201d\n\nBlakeney was apparently satisfied at last with the result of his polishing operations. He rose, gave a slight yawn, and turned toward the door.\n\n\u201cGood night, my dear fellow,\u201d he said pleasantly; \u201cit is time we were all abed. I am so demmed fatigued.\u201d\n\n\u201cPercy!\u201d exclaimed the young man hotly.\n\n\u201cEh? What is it?\u201d queried the other lazily.\n\n\u201cYou are not going to leave me like this--without a word?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have said a great many words, my good fellow. I have said \u2018good night,\u2019 and remarked that I was demmed fatigued.\u201d\n\nHe was standing beside the door which led to his bedroom, and now he pushed it open with his hand.\n\n\u201cPercy, you cannot go and leave me like this!\u201d reiterated Armand with rapidly growing irritation.\n\n\u201cLike what, my dear fellow?\u201d queried Sir Percy with good-humoured impatience.\n\n\u201cWithout a word--without a sign. What have I done that you should treat me like a child, unworthy even of attention?\u201d\n\nBlakeney had turned back and was now facing him, towering above the slight figure of the younger man. His face had lost none of its gracious air, and beneath their heavy lids his eyes looked down not unkindly on his friend.\n\n\u201cWould you have preferred it, Armand,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cif I had said the word that your ears have heard even though my lips have not uttered it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d murmured Armand defiantly.\n\n\u201cWhat sign would you have had me make?\u201d continued Sir Percy, his pleasant voice falling calm and mellow on the younger man\u2019s supersensitive consciousness: \u201cThat of branding you, Marguerite\u2019s brother, as a liar and a cheat?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlakeney!\u201d retorted the other, as with flaming cheeks and wrathful eyes he took a menacing step toward his friend; \u201chad any man but you dared to speak such words to me--\u201d\n\n\u201cI pray to God, Armand, that no man but I has the right to speak them.\u201d",
    "Just before five o\u2019clock in the afternoon the labourers were paid off. It was then too dark to continue work. Armand would have liked to talk to Sir Andrew, if only for a moment. He felt lonely and desperately anxious. He had hoped to tire out his nerves as well as his body, but in this he had not succeeded. As soon as he had given up his tools, his brain began to work again more busily than ever. It followed Percy in his peregrinations through the city, trying to discover where those brutes were keeping Jeanne.\n\nThat task had suddenly loomed up before Armand\u2019s mind with all its terrible difficulties. How could Percy--a marked man if ever there was one--go from prison to prison to inquire about Jeanne? The very idea seemed preposterous. Armand ought never to have consented to such an insensate plan. The more he thought of it, the more impossible did it seem that Blakeney could find anything out.\n\nSir Andrew Ffoulkes was nowhere to be seen. St. Just wandered about in the dark, lonely streets of this outlying quarter vainly trying to find the friend in whom he could confide, who, no doubt, would reassure him as to Blakeney\u2019s probable movements in Paris. Then as the hour approached for the closing of the city gates Armand took up his stand at an angle of the street from whence he could see both the gate on one side of him and the thin line of the canal intersecting the street at its further end.\n\nUnless Percy came within the next five minutes the gates would be closed and the difficulties of crossing the barrier would be increased a hundredfold. The market gardeners with their covered carts filed out of the gate one by one; the labourers on foot were returning to their homes; there was a group of stonemasons, a few road-makers, also a number of beggars, ragged and filthy, who herded somewhere in the neighbourhood of the canal.\n\nIn every form, under every disguise, Armand hoped to discover Percy. He could not stand still for very long, but strode up and down the road that skirts the fortifications at this point.\n\nThere were a good many idlers about at this hour; some men who had finished their work, and meant to spend an hour or so in one of the drinking shops that abounded in the neighbourhood of the wharf; others who liked to gather a small knot of listeners around them, whilst they discoursed on the politics of the day, or rather raged against the Convention, which was all made up of traitors to the people\u2019s welfare.\n\nArmand, trying manfully to play his part, joined one of the groups that stood gaping round a street orator. He shouted with the best of them, waved his cap in the air, and applauded or hissed in unison with the majority. But his eyes never wandered for long away from the gate whence Percy must come now at any moment--now or not at all.\n\nAt what precise moment the awful doubt took birth in his mind the young man could not afterwards have said. Perhaps it was when he heard the roll of drums proclaiming the closing of the gates, and witnessed the changing of the guard.\n\nPercy had not come. He could not come now, and he (Armand) would have the night to face without news of Jeanne. Something, of course, had detained Percy; perhaps he had been unable to get definite information about Jeanne; perhaps the information which he had obtained was too terrible to communicate.\n\nIf only Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had been there, and Armand had had some one to talk to, perhaps then he would have found sufficient strength of mind to wait with outward patience, even though his nerves were on the rack.\n\nDarkness closed in around him, and with the darkness came the full return of the phantoms that had assailed him in the house of the Square du Roule when first he had heard of Jeanne\u2019s arrest. The open place facing the gate had transformed itself into the Place de la Revolution, the tall rough post that held a flickering oil lamp had become the gaunt arm of the guillotine, the feeble light of the lamp was the knife that gleamed with the reflection of a crimson light.\n\nAnd Armand saw himself, as in a vision, one of a vast and noisy throng--they were all pressing round him so that he could not move; they were brandishing caps and tricolour flags, also pitchforks and scythes. He had seen such a crowd four years ago rushing towards the Bastille. Now they were all assembled here around him and around the guillotine.\n\nSuddenly a distant rattle caught his subconscious ear: the rattle of wheels on rough cobble-stones. Immediately the crowd began to cheer and to shout; some sang the \u201cCa ira!\u201d and others screamed:\n\n\u201cLes aristos! a la lanterne! a mort! a mort! les aristos!\u201d\n\nHe saw it all quite plainly, for the darkness had vanished, and the vision was more vivid than even reality could have been. The rattle of wheels grew louder, and presently the cart debouched on the open place.\n\nMen and women sat huddled up in the cart; but in the midst of them a woman stood, and her eyes were fixed upon Armand. She wore her pale-grey satin gown, and a white kerchief was folded across her bosom. Her brown hair fell in loose soft curls all round her head. She looked exactly like the exquisite cameo which Marguerite used to wear. Her hands were tied with cords behind her back, but between her fingers she held a small bunch of violets.\n\nArmand saw it all. It was, of course, a vision, and he knew that it was one, but he believed that the vision was prophetic. No thought of the chief whom he had sworn to trust and to obey came to chase away these imaginings of his fevered fancy. He saw Jeanne, and only Jeanne, standing on the tumbril and being led to the guillotine. Sir Andrew was not there, and Percy had not come. Armand believed that a direct message had come to him from heaven to save his beloved.",
    "She flew into her arms, holding the friend whom she loved so well close and closer to her heart, trying to hide her face, which was wet with tears, in the folds of Marguerite\u2019s kerchief. \u201cCome inside, my darling,\u201d said Marguerite. \u201cWhy, how cold your little hands are!\u201d She was on the point of turning back to her boudoir, drawing Lady Ffoulkes by the hand, when suddenly she caught sight of Sir Andrew, who stood at a little distance from her, at the top of the stairs. \u201cSir Andrew!\u201d she exclaimed with unstinted gladness. Then she paused. The cry of welcome died on her lips, leaving them dry and parted. She suddenly felt as if some fearful talons had gripped her heart and were tearing at it with sharp, long nails; the blood flew from her cheeks and from her limbs, leaving her with a sense of icy numbness. She backed into the room, still holding Suzanne\u2019s hand, and drawing her in with her. Sir Andrew followed them, then closed the door behind him. At last the word escaped Marguerite\u2019s parched lips: \u201cPercy! Something has happened to him! He is dead?\u201d \u201cNo, no!\u201d exclaimed Sir Andrew quickly. Suzanne put her loving arms round her friend and drew her down into the chair by the fire. She knelt at her feet on the hearthrug, and pressed her own burning lips on Marguerite\u2019s icy-cold hands. Sir Andrew stood silently by, a world of loving friendship, of heart-broken sorrow, in his eyes. There was silence in the pretty white-panelled room for a while. Marguerite sat with her eyes closed, bringing the whole armoury of her will power to bear her up outwardly now. \u201cTell me!\u201d she said at last, and her voice was toneless and dull, like one that came from the depths of a grave--\u201ctell me--exactly--everything. Don\u2019t be afraid. I can bear it. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\n\n\nSir Andrew remained standing, with bowed head and one hand resting on the table. In a firm, clear voice he told her the events of the past few days as they were known to him. All that he tried to hide was Armand\u2019s disobedience, which, in his heart, he felt was the primary cause of the catastrophe. He told of the rescue of the Dauphin from the Temple, the midnight drive in the coal-cart, the meeting with Hastings and Tony in the spinney. He only gave vague explanations of Armand\u2019s stay in Paris which caused Percy to go back to the city, even at the moment when his most daring plan had been so successfully carried through. \u201cArmand, I understand, has fallen in love with a beautiful woman in Paris, Lady Blakeney,\u201d he said, seeing that a strange, puzzled look had appeared in Marguerite\u2019s pale face. \u201cShe was arrested the day before the rescue of the Dauphin from the Temple. Armand could not join us. He felt that he could not leave her. I am sure that you will understand.\u201d\n\n\nThen as she made no comment, he resumed his narrative: \u201cI had been ordered to go back to La Villette, and there to resume my duties as a labourer in the day-time, and to wait for Percy during the night. The fact that I had received no message from him for two days had made me somewhat worried, but I have such faith in him, such belief in his good luck and his ingenuity, that I would not allow myself to be really anxious. Then on the third day I heard the news.\u201d \u201cWhat news?\u201d asked Marguerite mechanically. \u201cThat the Englishman who was known as the Scarlet Pimpernel had been captured in a house in the Rue de la Croix Blanche, and had been imprisoned in the Conciergerie.\u201d \u201cThe Rue de la Croix Blanche? Where is that?\u201d \u201cIn the Montmartre quarter. Armand lodged there. Percy, I imagine, was working to get him away; and those brutes captured him.\u201d \u201cHaving heard the news, Sir Andrew, what did you do?\u201d \u201cI went into Paris and ascertained its truth.\u201d \u201cAnd there is no doubt of it?\u201d \u201cAlas, none! I went to the house in the Rue de la Croix Blanche. Armand had disappeared. I succeeded in inducing the concierge to talk. She seems to have been devoted to her lodger. Amidst tears she told me some of the details of the capture. Can you bear to hear them, Lady Blakeney?\u201d \u201cYes--tell me everything--don\u2019t be afraid,\u201d she reiterated with the same dull monotony.\n\n\n\u201cIt appears that early on the Tuesday morning the son of the concierge--a lad about fifteen--was sent off by her lodger with a message to No. 9 Rue St. Germain l\u2019Auxerrois. That was the house where Percy was staying all last week, where he kept disguises and so on for us all, and where some of our meetings were held. Percy evidently expected that Armand would try and communicate with him at that address, for when the lad arrived in front of the house he was accosted--so he says--by a big, rough workman, who browbeat him into giving up the lodger\u2019s letter, and finally pressed a piece of gold into his hand. The workman was Blakeney, of course. I imagine that Armand, at the time that he wrote the letter, must have been under the belief that Mademoiselle Lange was still in prison; he could not know then that Blakeney had already got her into comparative safety. In the letter he must have spoken of the terrible plight in which he stood, and also of his fears for the woman whom he loved. Percy was not the man to leave a comrade in the lurch! He would not be the man whom we all love and admire, whose word we all obey, for whose sake we would gladly all of us give our life--he would not be that man if he did not brave even certain dangers in order to be of help to those who call on him. Armand called and Percy went to him. He must have known that Armand was being spied upon, for Armand, alas! was already a marked man, and the watch-dogs of those infernal committees were already on his heels. Whether these sleuth-hounds had followed the son of the concierge and seen him give the letter to the workman in the Rue St. Germain l\u2019Auxerrois, or whether the concierge in the Rue de la Croix Blanche was nothing but a spy of Heron\u2019s, or, again whether the Committee of General Security kept a company of soldiers in constant alert in that house, we shall, of course, never know. All that I do know is that Percy entered that fatal house at half-past ten, and that a quarter of an hour later the concierge saw some of the soldiers descending the stairs, carrying a heavy burden. She peeped out of her lodge, and by the light in the corridor she saw that the heavy burden was the body of a man bound closely with ropes: his eyes were closed, his clothes were stained with blood. He was seemingly unconscious. The next day the official organ of the Government proclaimed the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and there was a public holiday in honour of the event.\u201d\n\n\nMarguerite had listened to this terrible narrative dry-eyed and silent. Now she still sat there, hardly conscious of what went on around her--of Suzanne\u2019s tears, that fell unceasingly upon her fingers--of Sir Andrew, who had sunk into a chair, and buried his head in his hands. She was hardly conscious that she lived; the universe seemed to have stood still before this awful, monstrous cataclysm. But, nevertheless, she was the first to return to the active realities of the present. \u201cSir Andrew,\u201d she said after a while, \u201ctell me, where are my Lords Tony and Hastings?\u201d",
    "That same evening Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, having announced his intention of gleaning further news of Armand, if possible, went out shortly after seven o\u2019clock, promising to be home again about nine. Marguerite, on the other hand, had to make her friend a solemn promise that she would try and eat some supper which the landlady of these miserable apartments had agreed to prepare for her. So far they had been left in peaceful occupation of these squalid lodgings in a tumble-down house on the Quai de la Ferraille, facing the house of Justice, the grim walls of which Marguerite would watch with wide-open dry eyes for as long as the grey wintry light lingered over them. Even now, though the darkness had set in, and snow, falling in close, small flakes, threw a thick white veil over the landscape, she sat at the open window long after Sir Andrew had gone out, watching the few small flicks of light that blinked across from the other side of the river, and which came from the windows of the Chatelet towers. The windows of the Conciergerie she could not see, for these gave on one of the inner courtyards; but there was a melancholy consolation even in the gazing on those walls that held in their cruel, grim embrace all that she loved in the world.\n\n\nIt seemed so impossible to think of Percy--the laughter-loving, irresponsible, light-hearted adventurer--as the prey of those fiends who would revel in their triumph, who would crush him, humiliate him, insult him--ye gods alive! even torture him, perhaps--that they might break the indomitable spirit that would mock them even on the threshold of death. Surely, surely God would never allow such monstrous infamy as the deliverance of the noble soaring eagle into the hands of those preying jackals! Marguerite--though her heart ached beyond what human nature could endure, though her anguish on her husband\u2019s account was doubled by that which she felt for her brother--could not bring herself to give up all hope. Sir Andrew said it rightly; while there was life there was hope. While there was life in those vigorous limbs, spirit in that daring mind, how could puny, rampant beasts gain the better of the immortal soul? As for Armand--why, if Percy were free she would have no cause to fear for Armand.\n\n\nShe sighed a sigh of deep, of passionate regret and longing. If she could only see her husband; if she could only look for one second into those laughing, lazy eyes, wherein she alone knew how to fathom the infinity of passion that lay within their depths; if she could but once feel his--ardent kiss on her lips, she could more easily endure this agonising suspense, and wait confidently and courageously for the issue. She turned away from the window, for the night was getting bitterly cold. From the tower of St. Germain l\u2019Auxerrois the clock slowly struck eight. Even as the last sound of the historic bell died away in the distance she heard a timid knocking at the door. \u201cEnter!\u201d she called unthinkingly. She thought it was her landlady, come up with more wood, mayhap, for the fire, so she did not turn to the door when she heard it being slowly opened, then closed again, and presently a soft tread on the threadbare carpet. \u201cMay I crave your kind attention, Lady Blakeney?\u201d said a harsh voice, subdued to tones of ordinary courtesy.\n\n\nShe quickly repressed a cry of terror. How well she knew that voice! When last she heard it it was at Boulogne, dictating that infamous letter--the weapon wherewith Percy had so effectually foiled his enemy. She turned and faced the man who was her bitterest foe--hers in the person of the man she loved. \u201cChauvelin!\u201d she gasped. \u201cHimself at your service, dear lady,\u201d he said simply. He stood in the full light of the lamp, his trim, small figure boldly cut out against the dark wall beyond. He wore the usual sable-coloured clothes which he affected, with the primly-folded jabot and cuffs edged with narrow lace. Without waiting for permission from her he quietly and deliberately placed his hat and cloak on a chair. Then he turned once more toward her, and made a movement as if to advance into the room; but instinctively she put up a hand as if to ward off the calamity of his approach. He shrugged his shoulders, and the shadow of a smile, that had neither mirth nor kindliness in it, hovered round the corners of his thin lips. \u201cHave I your permission to sit?\u201d he asked. \u201cAs you will,\u201d she replied slowly, keeping her wide-open eyes fixed upon him as does a frightened bird upon the serpent whom it loathes and fears. \u201cAnd may I crave a few moments of your undivided attention, Lady Blakeney?\u201d he continued, taking a chair, and so placing it beside the table that the light of the lamp when he sat remained behind him and his face was left in shadow. \u201cIs it necessary?\u201d asked Marguerite. \u201cIt is,\u201d he replied curtly, \u201cif you desire to see and speak with your husband--to be of use to him before it is too late.\u201d \u201cThen, I pray you, speak, citizen, and I will listen.\u201d\n\n\nShe sank into a chair, not heeding whether the light of the lamp fell on her face or not, whether the lines in her haggard cheeks, or her tear-dimmed eyes showed plainly the sorrow and despair that had traced them. She had nothing to hide from this man, the cause of all the tortures which she endured. She knew that neither courage nor sorrow would move him, and that hatred for Percy--personal deadly hatred for the man who had twice foiled him--had long crushed the last spark of humanity in his heart. \u201cPerhaps, Lady Blakeney,\u201d he began after a slight pause and in his smooth, even voice, \u201cit would interest you to hear how I succeeded in procuring for myself this pleasure of an interview with you?\u201d \u201cYour spies did their usual work, I suppose,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cExactly. We have been on your track for three days, and yesterday evening an unguarded movement on the part of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes gave us the final clue to your whereabouts.\u201d \u201cOf Sir Andrew Ffoulkes?\u201d she asked, greatly puzzled. \u201cHe was in an eating-house, cleverly disguised, I own, trying to glean information, no doubt as to the probable fate of Sir Percy Blakeney. As chance would have it, my friend Heron, of the Committee of General Security, chanced to be discussing with reprehensible openness--er--certain--what shall I say?--certain measures which, at my advice, the Committee of Public Safety have been forced to adopt with a view to--\u201d \u201cA truce on your smooth-tongued speeches, citizen Chauvelin,\u201d she interposed firmly. \u201cSir Andrew Ffoulkes has told me naught of this--so I pray you speak plainly and to the point, if you can.\u201d\n\n\nHe bowed with marked irony. \u201cAs you please,\u201d he said. \u201cSir Andrew Ffoulkes, hearing certain matters of which I will tell you anon, made a movement which betrayed him to one of our spies. At a word from citizen Heron this man followed on the heels of the young farrier who had shown such interest in the conversation of the Chief Agent. Sir Andrew, I imagine, burning with indignation at what he had heard, was perhaps not quite so cautious as he usually is. Anyway, the man on his track followed him to this door. It was quite simple, as you see. As for me, I had guessed a week ago that we would see the beautiful Lady Blakeney in Paris before long. When I knew where Sir Andrew Ffoulkes lodged, I had no difficulty in guessing that Lady Blakeney would not be far off.\u201d \u201cAnd what was there in citizen Heron\u2019s conversation last night,\u201d she asked quietly, \u201cthat so aroused Sir Andrew\u2019s indignation?\u201d \u201cHe has not told you?\u201d",
    "Marguerite found the gate at the bottom of the monumental stairs open when she arrived. Chauvelin was standing immediately inside the building waiting for her. \u201cWe are prepared for your visit, Lady Blakeney,\u201d he said, \u201cand the prisoner knows that you are coming.\u201d He led the way down one of the numerous and interminable corridors of the building, and she followed briskly, pressing her hand against her bosom there where the folds of her kerchief hid the steel files and the precious dagger. Even in the gloom of these ill-lighted passages she realised that she was surrounded by guards. There were soldiers everywhere; two had stood behind the door when first she entered, and had immediately closed it with a loud clang behind her; and all the way down the corridors, through the half-light engendered by feebly flickering lamps, she caught glimpses of the white facings on the uniforms of the town guard, or occasionally the glint of steel of a bayonet. Presently Chauvelin paused beside a door, which he had just reached. His hand was on the latch, for it did not appear to be locked, and he turned toward Marguerite. \u201cI am very sorry, Lady Blakeney,\u201d he said in simple, deferential tones, \u201cthat the prison authorities, who at my request are granting you this interview at such an unusual hour, have made a slight condition to your visit.\u201d \u201cA condition?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cYou must forgive me,\u201d he said, as if purposely evading her question, \u201cfor I give you my word that I had nothing to do with a regulation that you might justly feel was derogatory to your dignity. If you will kindly step in here a wardress in charge will explain to you what is required.\u201d\n\n\nHe pushed open the door, and stood aside ceremoniously in order to allow her to pass in. She looked on him with deep puzzlement and a look of dark suspicion in her eyes. But her mind was too much engrossed with the thought of her meeting with Percy to worry over any trifle that might--as her enemy had inferred--offend her womanly dignity. She walked into the room, past Chauvelin, who whispered as she went by: \u201cI will wait for you here. And, I pray you, if you have aught to complain of summon me at once.\u201d Then he closed the door behind her. The room in which Marguerite now found herself was a small unventilated quadrangle, dimly lighted by a hanging lamp. A woman in a soiled cotton gown and lank grey hair brushed away from a parchment-like forehead rose from the chair in which she had been sitting when Marguerite entered, and put away some knitting on which she had apparently been engaged. \u201cI was to tell you, citizeness,\u201d she said the moment the door had been closed and she was alone with Marguerite, \u201cthat the prison authorities have given orders that I should search you before you visit the prisoner.\u201d She repeated this phrase mechanically like a child who has been taught to say a lesson by heart. She was a stoutish middle-aged woman, with that pasty, flabby skin peculiar to those who live in want of fresh air; but her small, dark eyes were not unkindly, although they shifted restlessly from one object to another as if she were trying to avoid looking the other woman straight in the face. \u201cThat you should search me!\u201d reiterated Marguerite slowly, trying to understand. \u201cYes,\u201d replied the woman. \u201cI was to tell you to take off your clothes, so that I might look them through and through. I have often had to do this before when visitors have been allowed inside the prison, so it is no use your trying to deceive me in any way. I am very sharp at finding out if any one has papers, or files or ropes concealed in an underpetticoat. Come,\u201d she added more roughly, seeing that Marguerite had remained motionless in the middle of the room; \u201cthe quicker you are about it the sooner you will be taken to see the prisoner.\u201d\n\n\nThese words had their desired effect. The proud Lady Blakeney, inwardly revolting at the outrage, knew that resistance would be worse than useless. Chauvelin was the other side of the door. A call from the woman would bring him to her assistance, and Marguerite was only longing to hasten the moment when she could be with her husband. She took off her kerchief and her gown and calmly submitted to the woman\u2019s rough hands as they wandered with sureness and accuracy to the various pockets and folds that might conceal prohibited articles. The woman did her work with peculiar stolidity; she did not utter a word when she found the tiny steel files and placed them on a table beside her. In equal silence she laid the little dagger beside them, and the purse which contained twenty gold pieces. These she counted in front of Marguerite and then replaced them in the purse. Her face expressed neither surprise, nor greed nor pity. She was obviously beyond the reach of bribery--just a machine paid by the prison authorities to do this unpleasant work, and no doubt terrorised into doing it conscientiously. When she had satisfied herself that Marguerite had nothing further concealed about her person, she allowed her to put her dress on once more. She even offered to help her on with it. When Marguerite was fully dressed she opened the door for her. Chauvelin was standing in the passage waiting patiently. At sight of Marguerite, whose pale, set face betrayed nothing of the indignation which she felt, he turned quick, inquiring eyes on the woman. \u201cTwo files, a dagger and a purse with twenty louis,\u201d said the latter curtly. Chauvelin made no comment. He received the information quite placidly, as if it had no special interest for him. Then he said quietly: \u201cThis way, citizeness!\u201d\n\n\nMarguerite followed him, and two minutes later he stood beside a heavy nail-studded door that had a small square grating let into one of the panels, and said simply: \u201cThis is it.\u201d Two soldiers of the National Guard were on sentry at the door, two more were pacing up and down outside it, and had halted when citizen Chauvelin gave his name and showed his tricolour scarf of office. From behind the small grating in the door a pair of eyes peered at the newcomers. \u201cQui va la?\u201d came the quick challenge from the guard-room within. \u201cCitizen Chauvelin of the Committee of Public Safety,\u201d was the prompt reply. There was the sound of grounding of arms, of the drawing of bolts and the turning of a key in a complicated lock. The prison was kept locked from within, and very heavy bars had to be moved ere the ponderous door slowly swung open on its hinges. Two steps led up into the guard-room. Marguerite mounted them with the same feeling of awe and almost of reverence as she would have mounted the steps of a sacrificial altar. The guard-room itself was more brilliantly lighted than the corridor outside. The sudden glare of two or three lamps placed about the room caused her momentarily to close her eyes that were aching with many shed and unshed tears. The air was rank and heavy with the fumes of tobacco, of wine and stale food. A large barred window gave on the corridor immediately above the door. When Marguerite felt strong enough to look around her, she saw that the room was filled with soldiers. Some were sitting, others standing, others lay on rugs against the wall, apparently asleep. There was one who appeared to be in command, for with a word he checked the noise that was going on in the room when she entered, and then he said curtly: \u201cThis way, citizeness!\u201d He turned to an opening in the wall on the left, the stone-lintel of a door, from which the door itself had been removed; an iron bar ran across the opening, and this the sergeant now lifted, nodding to Marguerite to go within. Instinctively she looked round for Chauvelin. But he was nowhere to be seen.",
    "Citizen Chauvelin had drawn his colleague with him to the end of the cell that was farthest away from the recess, and the table at which the prisoner was sitting. Here the noise and hubbub that went on constantly in the guard room would effectually drown a whispered conversation. Chauvelin called to the sergeant to hand him a couple of chairs over the barrier. These he placed against the wall opposite the opening, and beckoning Heron to sit down, he did likewise, placing himself close to his colleague. From where the two men now sat they could see both into the guard-room opposite them and into the recess at the furthermost end of the cell.\n\n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d began Chauvelin after a while, and sinking his voice to a whisper, \u201clet me understand you thoroughly, citizen Heron. Do you want the death of the Englishman, either to-day or to-morrow, either in this prison or on the guillotine? For that now is easy of accomplishment; or do you want, above all, to get hold of little Capet?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is Capet I want,\u201d growled Heron savagely under his breath. \u201cCapet! Capet! My own neck is dependent on my finding Capet. Curse you, have I not told you that clearly enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have told it me very clearly, citizen Heron; but I wished to make assurance doubly sure, and also make you understand that I, too, want the Englishman to betray little Capet into your hands. I want that more even than I do his death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen in the name of hell, citizen, give me your advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy advice to you, citizen Heron, is this: Give your prisoner now just a sufficiency of food to revive him--he will have had a few moments\u2019 sleep--and when he has eaten, and, mayhap, drunk a glass of wine, he will, no doubt, feel a recrudescence of strength, then give him pen and ink and paper. He must, as he says, write to one of his followers, who, in his turn, I suppose, will communicate with the others, bidding them to be prepared to deliver up little Capet to us; the letter must make it clear to that crowd of English gentlemen that their beloved chief is giving up the uncrowned King of France to us in exchange for his own safety. But I think you will agree with me, citizen Heron, that it would not be over-prudent on our part to allow that same gallant crowd to be forewarned too soon of the proposed doings of their chief. Therefore, I think, we\u2019ll explain to the prisoner that his follower, whom he will first apprise of his intentions, shall start with us to-morrow on our expedition, and accompany us until its last stage, when, if it is found necessary, he may be sent on ahead, strongly escorted of course, and with personal messages from the gallant Scarlet Pimpernel to the members of his League.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will be the good of that?\u201d broke in Heron viciously. \u201cDo you want one of his accursed followers to be ready to give him a helping hand on the way if he tries to slip through our fingers?\u201d\n\n\u201cPatience, patience, my good Heron!\u201d rejoined Chauvelin with a placid smile. \u201cHear me out to the end. Time is precious. You shall offer what criticism you will when I have finished, but not before.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on, then. I listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not only proposing that one member of the Scarlet Pimpernel League shall accompany us to-morrow,\u201d continued Chauvelin, \u201cbut I would also force the prisoner\u2019s wife--Marguerite Blakeney--to follow in our train.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman? Bah! What for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell you the reason of this presently. In her case I should not let the prisoner know beforehand that she too will form a part of our expedition. Let this come as a pleasing surprise for him. She could join us on our way out of Paris.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow will you get hold of her?\u201d\n\n\u201cEasily enough. I know where to find her. I traced her myself a few days ago to a house in the Rue de Charonne, and she is not likely to have gone away from Paris while her husband was at the Conciergerie. But this is a digression, let me proceed more consecutively. The letter, as I have said, being written to-night by the prisoner to one of his followers, I will myself see that it is delivered into the right hands. You, citizen Heron, will in the meanwhile make all arrangements for the journey. We ought to start at dawn, and we ought to be prepared, especially during the first fifty leagues of the way, against organised attack in case the Englishman leads us into an ambush.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. He might even do that, curse him!\u201d muttered Heron.\n\n\u201cHe might, but it is unlikely. Still it is best to be prepared. Take a strong escort, citizen, say twenty or thirty men, picked and trained soldiers who would make short work of civilians, however well-armed they might be. There are twenty members--including the chief--in that Scarlet Pimpernel League, and I do not quite see how from this cell the prisoner could organise an ambuscade against us at a given time. Anyhow, that is a matter for you to decide. I have still to place before you a scheme which is a measure of safety for ourselves and our men against ambush as well as against trickery, and which I feel sure you will pronounce quite adequate.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me hear it, then!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prisoner will have to travel by coach, of course. You can travel with him, if you like, and put him in irons, and thus avert all chances of his escaping on the road. But\u201d--and here Chauvelin made a long pause, which had the effect of holding his colleague\u2019s attention still more closely--\u201cremember that we shall have his wife and one of his friends with us. Before we finally leave Paris tomorrow we will explain to the prisoner that at the first attempt to escape on his part, at the slightest suspicion that he has tricked us for his own ends or is leading us into an ambush--at the slightest suspicion, I say--you, citizen Heron, will order his friend first, and then Marguerite Blakeney herself, to be summarily shot before his eyes.\u201d",
    "What occurred within the inner cell of the Conciergerie prison within the next half-hour of that 16th day of Pluviose in the year II of the Republic is, perhaps, too well known to history to need or bear overfull repetition. Chroniclers intimate with the inner history of those infamous days have told us how the chief agent of the Committee of General Security gave orders one hour after midnight that hot soup, white bread and wine be served to the prisoner, who for close on fourteen days previously had been kept on short rations of black bread and water; the sergeant in charge of the guard-room watch for the night also received strict orders that that same prisoner was on no account to be disturbed until the hour of six in the morning, when he was to be served with anything in the way of breakfast that he might fancy. All this we know, and also that citizen Heron, having given all necessary orders for the morning\u2019s expedition, returned to the Conciergerie, and found his colleague Chauvelin waiting for him in the guard-room.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d he asked with febrile impatience--\u201cthe prisoner?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe seems better and stronger,\u201d replied Chauvelin.\n\n\u201cNot too well, I hope?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, only just well enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have seen him--since his supper?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly from the doorway. It seems he ate and drank hardly at all, and the sergeant had some difficulty in keeping him awake until you came.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now for the letter,\u201d concluded Heron with the same marked feverishness of manner which sat so curiously on his uncouth personality. \u201cPen, ink and paper, sergeant!\u201d he commanded.\n\n\u201cOn the table, in the prisoner\u2019s cell, citizen,\u201d replied the sergeant.\n\nHe preceded the two citizens across the guard-room to the doorway, and raised for them the iron bar, lowering it back after them. The next moment Heron and Chauvelin were once more face to face with their prisoner.\n\nWhether by accident or design the lamp had been so placed that as the two men approached its light fell full upon their faces, while that of the prisoner remained in shadow. He was leaning forward with both elbows on the table, his thin, tapering fingers toying with the pen and ink-horn which had been placed close to his hand.\n\n\u201cI trust that everything has been arranged for your comfort, Sir Percy?\u201d Chauvelin asked with a sarcastic little smile.\n\n\u201cI thank you, sir,\u201d replied Blakeney politely.\n\n\u201cYou feel refreshed, I hope?\u201d\n\n\u201cGreatly so, I assure you. But I am still demmed sleepy; and if you would kindly be brief--\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have not changed your mind, sir?\u201d queried Chauvelin, and a note of anxiety, which he vainly tried to conceal, quivered in his voice.\n\n\u201cNo, my good M. Chambertin,\u201d replied Blakeney with the same urbane courtesy, \u201cI have not changed my mind.\u201d\n\nA sigh of relief escaped the lips of both the men. The prisoner certainly had spoken in a clearer and firmer voice; but whatever renewed strength wine and food had imparted to him he apparently did not mean to employ in renewed obstinacy. Chauvelin, after a moment\u2019s pause, resumed more calmly:\n\n\u201cYou are prepared to direct us to the place where little Capet lies hidden?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am prepared to do anything, sir, to get out of this d--d hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. My colleague, citizen Heron, has arranged for an escort of twenty men picked from the best regiment of the Garde de Paris to accompany us--yourself, him and me--to wherever you will direct us. Is that clear?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfectly, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must not imagine for a moment that we, on the other hand, guarantee to give you your life and freedom even if this expedition prove unsuccessful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not venture on suggesting such a wild proposition, sir,\u201d said Blakeney placidly.",
    "Rain! Rain! Rain! Incessant, monotonous and dreary! The wind had changed round to the southwest. It blew now in great gusts that sent weird, sighing sounds through the trees, and drove the heavy showers into the faces of the men as they rode on, with heads bent forward against the gale. The rain-sodden bridles slipped through their hands, bringing out sores and blisters on their palms; the horses were fidgety, tossing their heads with wearying persistence as the wet trickled into their ears, or the sharp, intermittent hailstones struck their sensitive noses.\n\nThree days of this awful monotony, varied only by the halts at wayside inns, the changing of troops at one of the guard-houses on the way, the reiterated commands given to the fresh squad before starting on the next lap of this strange, momentous way; and all the while, audible above the clatter of horses\u2019 hoofs, the rumbling of coach-wheels--two closed carriages, each drawn by a pair of sturdy horses; which were changed at every halt. A soldier on each box urged them to a good pace to keep up with the troopers, who were allowed to go at an easy canter or light jog-trot, whatever might prove easiest and least fatiguing. And from time to time Heron\u2019s gaunt, ugly face, crowned with a battered, sugar-loaf hat, appeared from time to time at the window of the coach. He was no horseman, and, moreover, preferred to keep the prisoner closely under his own eye. The corporal had told Armand that the prisoner was with citizen Heron inside the coach--in irons. Beyond that the soldiers could tell him nothing; they knew nothing of the object of this expedition. Vaguely they might have wondered in their dull minds why this particular prisoner was thus being escorted out of the Conciergerie prison with so much paraphernalia and such an air of mystery, when there were thousands of prisoners in the city and the provinces at the present moment who anon would be bundled up wholesale into carts to be dragged to the guillotine like a flock of sheep to the butchers.\n\nBut even if they wondered they made no remarks among themselves. Their faces, blue with the cold, were the perfect mirrors of their own unconquerable stolidity.\n\nThe tower clock of Notre Dame struck seven when the small cavalcade finally moved slowly out of the monumental gates. In the east the wan light of a February morning slowly struggled out of the surrounding gloom. Now the towers of many churches loomed ghostlike against the dull grey sky, and down below, on the right, the frozen river, like a smooth sheet of steel, wound its graceful curves round the islands and past the facade of the Louvres palace, whose walls looked grim and silent, like the mausoleum of the dead giants of the past. All around the great city gave signs of awakening; the business of the day renewed its course every twenty-four hours, despite the tragedies of death and of dishonour that walked with it hand in hand. From the Place de La Revolution the intermittent roll of drums came from time to time with its muffled sound striking the ear of the passer-by. Along the quay opposite an open-air camp was already astir; men, women, and children engaged in the great task of clothing and feeding the people of France, armed against tyranny, were bending to their task, even before the wintry dawn had spread its pale grey tints over the narrower streets of the city.\n\nArmand shivered under his cloak. This silent ride beneath the leaden sky, through the veil of half-frozen rain and snow, seemed like a dream to him. And now, as the outriders of the little cavalcade turned to cross the Pont au Change, he saw spread out on his left what appeared like the living panorama of these three weeks that had just gone by. He could see the house of the Rue St. Germain l\u2019Auxerrois where Percy had lodged before he carried through the rescue of the little Dauphin. Armand could even see the window at which the dreamer had stood, weaving noble dreams that his brilliant daring had turned into realities, until the hand of a traitor had brought him down to--to what? Armand would not have dared at this moment to look back at that hideous, vulgar hackney coach wherein that proud, reckless adventurer, who had defied Fate and mocked Death, sat, in chains, beside a loathsome creature whose very propinquity was an outrage. Now they were passing under the very house on the Quai de La Ferraille, above the saddler\u2019s shop, the house where Marguerite had lodged ten days ago, whither Armand had come, trying to fool himself into the belief that the love of \u201clittle mother\u201d could be deceived into blindness against his own crime. He had tried to draw a veil before those eyes which he had scarcely dared encounter, but he knew that that veil must lift one day, and then a curse would send him forth, outlawed and homeless, a wanderer on the face of the earth."

  "H. Rider Haggard -- Child of Storm": [
    "We white people think that we know everything. For instance, we think that we understand human nature. And so we do, as human nature appears to us, with all its trappings and accessories seen dimly through the glass of our conventions, leaving out those aspects of it which we have forgotten or do not think it polite to mention. But I, Allan Quatermain, reflecting upon these matters in my ignorant and uneducated fashion, have always held that no one really understands human nature who has not studied it in the rough. Well, that is the aspect of it with which I have been best acquainted.\n\nFor most of the years of my life I have handled the raw material, the virgin ore, not the finished ornament that is smelted out of it\u2014if, indeed, it is finished yet, which I greatly doubt. I dare say that a time may come when the perfected generations\u2014if Civilisation, as we understand it, really has a future and any such should be allowed to enjoy their hour on the World\u2014will look back to us as crude, half-developed creatures whose only merit was that we handed on the flame of life.\n\nMaybe, maybe, for everything goes by comparison; and at one end of the ladder is the ape-man, and at the other, as we hope, the angel. No, not the angel; he belongs to a different sphere, but that last expression of humanity upon which I will not speculate. While man is man\u2014that is, before he suffers the magical death-change into spirit, if such should be his destiny\u2014well, he will remain man. I mean that the same passions will sway him; he will aim at the same ambitions; he will know the same joys and be oppressed by the same fears, whether he lives in a Kafir hut or in a golden palace; whether he walks upon his two feet or, as for aught I know he may do one day, flies through the air. This is certain: that in the flesh he can never escape from our atmosphere, and while he breathes it, in the main with some variations prescribed by climate, local law and religion, he will do much as his forefathers did for countless ages.\n\nThat is why I have always found the savage so interesting, for in him, nakedly and forcibly expressed, we see those eternal principles which direct our human destiny.\n\nTo descend from these generalities, that is why also I, who hate writing, have thought it worth while, at the cost of some labour to myself, to occupy my leisure in what to me is a strange land\u2014for although I was born in England, it is not my country\u2014in setting down various experiences of my life that do, in my opinion, interpret this our universal nature. I dare say that no one will ever read them; still, perhaps they are worthy of record, and who knows? In days to come they may fall into the hands of others and prove of value. At any rate, they are true stories of interesting peoples, who, if they should survive in the savage competition of the nations, probably are doomed to undergo great changes. Therefore I tell of them before they began to change.\n\nNow, although I take it out of its strict chronological order, the first of these histories that I wish to preserve is in the main that of an extremely beautiful woman\u2014with the exception of a certain Nada, called \u201cthe Lily,\u201d of whom I hope to speak some day, I think the most beautiful that ever lived among the Zulus. Also she was, I think, the most able, the most wicked, and the most ambitious. Her attractive name\u2014for it was very attractive as the Zulus said it, especially those of them who were in love with her\u2014was Mameena, daughter of Umbezi. Her other name was Child of Storm (_Ingane-ye-Sipepo_, or, more freely and shortly, _O-we-Zulu_), but the word \u201cMa-mee-na\u201d had its origin in the sound of the wind that wailed about the hut when she was born.\n\nSince I have been settled in England I have read\u2014of course in a translation\u2014the story of Helen of Troy, as told by the Greek poet, Homer. Well, Mameena reminds me very much of Helen, or, rather, Helen reminds me of Mameena. At any rate, there was this in common between them, although one of them was black, or, rather, copper-coloured, and the other white\u2014they both were lovely; moreover, they both were faithless, and brought men by hundreds to their deaths. There, perhaps, the resemblance ends, since Mameena had much more fire and grit than Helen could boast, who, unless Homer misrepresents her, must have been but a poor thing after all. Beauty Itself, which those old rascals of Greek gods made use of to bait their snares set for the lives and honour of men, such was Helen, no more; that is, as I understand her, who have not had the advantage of a classical education. Now, Mameena, although she was superstitious\u2014a common weakness of great minds\u2014acknowledging no gods in particular, as we understand them, set her own snares, with varying success but a very definite object, namely, that of becoming the first woman in the world as she knew it\u2014the stormy, bloodstained world of the Zulus.\n\nBut the reader shall judge for himself, if ever such a person should chance to cast his eye upon this history.\n\nIt was in the year 1854 that I first met Mameena, and my acquaintance with her continued off and on until 1856, when it came to an end in a fashion that shall be told after the fearful battle of the Tugela in which Umbelazi, Panda\u2019s son and Cetewayo\u2019s brother\u2014who, to his sorrow, had also met Mameena\u2014lost his life. I was still a youngish man in those days, although I had already buried my second wife, as I have told elsewhere, after our brief but happy time of marriage.\n\nLeaving my boy in charge of some kind people in Durban, I started into \u201cthe Zulu\u201d\u2014a land with which I had already become well acquainted as a youth, there to carry on my wild life of trading and hunting.",
    "\u201cDo I understand that you wish me to give you one of my good guns with two mouths to it (i.e. double-barrelled), a gun worth at least twelve oxen, for nothing, O Saduko?\u201d I asked in a cold and scandalised voice.\n\n\u201cNot so, O Watcher-by-Night,\u201d he answered; \u201cnot so, O He-who-sleeps-with-one-eye-open\u201d (another free and difficult rendering of my native name, Macumazahn, or more correctly, Macumazana)\u2014\u201cI should never dream of offering such an insult to your high-born intelligence.\u201d He paused and took another pinch of snuff, then went on in a meditative voice: \u201cWhere I propose to get those hundred cattle there are many more; I am told not less than a thousand head in all. Now, _Inkoosi_,\u201d he added, looking at me sideways, \u201csuppose you gave me the gun I ask for, and suppose you accompanied me with your own gun and your armed hunters, it would be fair that you should have half the cattle, would it not?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d I said. \u201cSo, young man, you want to turn me into a cow-thief and get my throat cut by Panda for breaking the peace of his country?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither, Macumazahn, for these are my own cattle. Listen, now, and I will tell you a story. You have heard of Matiwane, the chief of the Amangwane?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cHis tribe lived near the head of the Umzinyati, did they not? Then they were beaten by the Boers or the English, and Matiwane came under the Zulus. But afterwards Dingaan wiped him out, with his House, and now his people are killed or scattered.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, his people are killed and scattered, but his House still lives. Macumazahn, I am his House, I, the only son of his chief wife, for Zikali the Wise Little One, the Ancient, who is of the Amangwane blood, and who hated Chaka and Dingaan\u2014yes, and Senzangakona their father before them, but whom none of them could kill because he is so great and has such mighty spirits for his servants, saved and sheltered me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he is so great, why, then, did he not save your father also, Saduko?\u201d I asked, as though I knew nothing of this Zikali.\n\n\u201cI cannot say, Macumazahn. Perhaps the spirits plant a tree for themselves, and to do so cut down many other trees. At least, so it happened. It happened thus: Bangu, chief of the Amakoba, whispered into Dingaan\u2019s ear that Matiwane, my father, was a wizard; also that he was very rich. Dingaan listened because he thought a sickness that he had came from Matiwane\u2019s witchcraft. He said: \u2018Go, Bangu, and take a company with you and pay Matiwane a visit of honour, and in the night, O in the night! Afterwards, Bangu, we will divide the cattle, for Matiwane is strong and clever, and you shall not risk your life for nothing.\u2019\u201d\n\nSaduko paused and looked down at the ground, brooding heavily.\n\n\u201cMacumazahn, it was done,\u201d he said presently. \u201cThey ate my father\u2019s meat, they drank his beer; they gave him a present from the king, they praised him with high names; yes, Bangu took snuff with him and called him brother. Then in the night, O in the night\u2014!\n\nMy father was in the hut with my mother, and I, so big only\u201d\u2014and he held his hand at the height of a boy of ten\u2014\u201cwas with them. The cry arose, the flames began to eat; my father looked out and saw. \u2018Break through the fence and away, woman,\u2019 he said; \u2018away with Saduko, that he may live to avenge me. Begone while I hold the gate! Begone to Zikali, for whose witchcrafts I pay with my blood.\u2019\n\nThen he kissed me on the brow, saying but one word, \u2018Remember,\u2019 and thrust us from the hut.\n\nMy mother broke a way through the fence; yes, she tore at it with her nails and teeth like a hyena. I looked back out of the shadow of the hut and saw Matiwane my father fighting like a buffalo. Men went down before him, one, two, three, although he had no shield: only his spear. Then Bangu crept behind him and stabbed him in the back and he threw up his arms and fell. I saw no more, for by now we were through the fence. We ran, but they perceived us. They hunted us as wild dogs hunt a buck. They killed my mother with a throwing assegai; it entered at her back and came out at her heart. I went mad, I drew it from her body, I ran at them. I dived beneath the shield of the first, a very tall man, and held the spear, so, in both my little hands. His weight came upon its point and it went through him as though he were but a bowl of buttermilk. Yes, he rolled over, quite dead, and the handle of the spear broke upon the ground. Now the others stopped astonished, for never had they seen such a thing. That a child should kill a tall warrior, oh! that tale had not been told. Some of them would have let me go, but just then Bangu came up and saw the dead man, who was his brother.\n\n\u2018_Wow!_\u2019 he said when he knew how the man had died. \u2018This lion\u2019s cub is a wizard also, for how else could he have killed a soldier who has known war? Hold out his arms that I may finish him slowly.\u2019\n\nSo two of them held out my arms, and Bangu came up with his spear.\u201d",
    "Shortly after dawn I was awakened by a voice calling me, which in a hazy fashion I recognised as that of Umbezi.\n\n\u201cMacumazahn,\u201d said the voice in a hoarse whisper, \u201cthe reeds below us are full of buffalo. Get up. Get up at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d I answered. \u201cIf the buffalo came into the reeds they will go out of them. We do not want meat.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Macumazahn; but I want their hides. Panda, the King, has demanded fifty shields of me, and without killing oxen that I can ill spare I have not the skins whereof to make them. Now, these buffalo are in a trap. This swamp is like a dish with one mouth. They cannot get out at the sides of the dish, and the mouth by which they came in is very narrow. If we station ourselves at either side of it we can kill many of them.\u201d\n\nBy this time I was thoroughly awake and had arisen from my blankets. Throwing a kaross over my shoulders, I left the hut, made of boughs, in which I was sleeping and walked a few paces to the crest of a rocky ridge, whence I could see the dry _vlei_ below. Here the mists of dawn still clung, but from it rose sounds of grunts, bellows and tramplings which I, an old hunter, could not mistake. Evidently a herd of buffalo, one or two hundred of them, had established themselves in those reeds.\n\nJust then my bastard servant, Scowl, and Saduko joined us, both of them full of excitement.\n\nIt appeared that Scowl, who never seemed to sleep at any natural time, had seen the buffalo entering the reeds, and estimated their number at two or three hundred. Saduko had examined the cleft through which they passed, and reported it to be so narrow that we could kill any number of them as they rushed out to escape.\n\n\u201cQuite so. I understand,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, my opinion is that we had better let them escape. Only four of us, counting Umbezi, are armed with guns, and assegais are not of much use against buffalo. Let them go, I say.\u201d\n\nUmbezi, thinking of a cheap raw material for the shields which had been requisitioned by the King, who would surely be pleased if they were made of such a rare and tough hide as that of buffalo, protested violently, and Saduko, either to please one whom he hoped might be his father-in-law or from sheer love of sport, for which he always had a positive passion, backed him up. Only Scowl\u2014whose dash of Hottentot blood made him cunning and cautious\u2014took my side, pointing out that we were very short of powder and that buffalo \u201cate up much lead.\u201d At last Saduko said:\n\n\u201cThe lord Macumazana is our captain; we must obey him, although it is a pity. But doubtless the prophesying of Zikali weighs upon his mind, so there is nothing to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cZikali!\u201d exclaimed Umbezi. \u201cWhat has the old dwarf to do with this matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind what he has or has not to do with it,\u201d I broke in, for although I do not think that he meant them as a taunt, but merely as a statement of fact, Saduko\u2019s words stung me to the quick, especially as my conscience told me that they were not altogether without foundation. \u201cWe will try to kill some of these buffalo,\u201d I went on, \u201calthough, unless the herd should get bogged, which is not likely, as the swamp is very dry, I do not think that we can hope for more than eight or ten at the most, which won\u2019t be of much use for shields. Come, let us make a plan. We have no time to lose, for I think they will begin to move again before the sun is well up.\u201d\n\nHalf an hour later the four of us who were armed with guns were posted behind rocks on either side of the steep, natural roadway cut by water, which led down to the _vlei_, and with us some of Umbezi\u2019s men. That chief himself was at my side\u2014a post of honour which he had insisted upon taking. To tell the truth, I did not dissuade him, for I thought that I should be safer so than if he were opposite to me, since, even if the old rifle did not go off of its own accord, Umbezi, when excited, was a most uncertain shot. The herd of buffalo appeared to have lain down in the reeds, so, being careful to post ourselves first, we sent three of the native bearers to the farther side of the _vlei_, with instructions to rouse the beasts by shouting. The remainder of the Zulus\u2014there were ten or a dozen of them armed with stabbing spears\u2014we kept with us.\n\nBut what did these scoundrels do? Instead of disturbing the herd by making a noise, as we told them, for some reason best known to themselves\u2014I expect it was because they were afraid to go into the _vlei_, where they might meet the horn of a buffalo at any moment\u2014they fired the dry reeds in three or four places at once, and this, if you please, with a strong wind blowing from them to us. In a minute or two the farther side of the swamp was a sheet of crackling flame that gave off clouds of dense white smoke. Then pandemonium began.",
    "\u201cNow, hearken. Although I am the colour of copper, I am comely. I am well-bred also; there is no higher blood than ours in Zululand, both on my father\u2019s and my mother\u2019s side, and, Macumazahn, I have a fire in me that shows me things. I can be great, and I long for greatness. Take me to wife, Macumazahn, and I swear to you that in ten years I will make you king of the Zulus. Forget your pale white women and wed yourself to that fire which burns in me, and it shall eat up all that stands between you and the Crown, as flame eats up dry grass. More, I will make you happy. If you choose to take other wives, I will not be jealous, because I know that I should hold your spirit, and that, compared to me, they would be nothing in your thought\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Mameena,\u201d I broke in, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be king of the Zulus.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, yes, you do, for every man wants power, and it is better to rule over a brave, black people\u2014thousands and thousands of them\u2014than to be no one among the whites. Think, think! There is wealth in the land. By your skill and knowledge the _amabuto_ [regiments] could be improved; with the wealth you would arm them with guns\u2014yes, and \u2018by-and-byes\u2019 also with the throat of thunder\u201d (that is, or was, the Kafir name for cannon).[2] \u201cThey would be invincible. Chaka\u2019s kingdom would be nothing to ours, for a hundred thousand warriors would sleep on their spears, waiting for your word. If you wished it even you could sweep out Natal and make the whites there your subjects, too. Or perhaps it would be safer to let them be, lest others should come across the green water to help them, and to strike northwards, where I am told there are great lands as rich and fair, in which none would dispute our sovereignty\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut, Mameena,\u201d I gasped, for this girl\u2019s titanic ambition literally overwhelmed me, \u201csurely you are mad! How would you do all these things?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not mad,\u201d she answered; \u201cI am only what is called great, and you know well enough that I can do them, not by myself, who am but a woman and tied with the ropes that bind women, but with you to cut those ropes and help me. I have a plan which will not fail. But, Macumazahn,\u201d she added in a changed voice, \u201cuntil I know that you will be my partner in it I will not tell it even to you, for perhaps you might talk\u2014in your sleep, and then the fire in my breast would soon go out\u2014for ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might talk now, for the matter of that, Mameena.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; for men like you do not tell tales of foolish girls who chance to love them. But if that plan began to work, and you heard say that kings or princes died, it might be otherwise. You might say, \u2018I think I know where the witch lives who causes these evils\u2019\u2014in your sleep, Macumazahn.\u201d\n\n\u201cMameena,\u201d I said, \u201ctell me no more. Setting your dreams on one side, can I be false to my friend, Saduko, who talks to me day and night of you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaduko! _Piff!_\u201d she exclaimed, with that expressive gesture of her hand.\n\n\u201cAnd can I be false,\u201d I continued, seeing that Saduko was no good card to play, \u201cto my friend, Umbezi, your father?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father!\u201d she laughed. \u201cWhy, would it not please him to grow great in your shadow? Only yesterday he told me to marry you, if I could, for then he would find a stick indeed to lean on, and be rid of Saduko\u2019s troubling.\u201d\n\nEvidently Umbezi was a worse card even than Saduko, so I played another.\n\n\u201cAnd can I help you, Mameena, to tread a road that at the best must be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not,\u201d she asked, \u201csince with or without you I am destined to tread that road, the only difference being that with you it will lead to glory and without you perhaps to the jackals and the vultures? Blood! _Piff!_ What is blood in Zululand?\u201d\n\nThis card also having failed, I tabled my last.\n\n\u201cGlory or no glory, I do not wish to share it, Mameena. I will not make war among a people who have entertained me hospitably, or plot the downfall of their Great Ones. As you told me just now, I am nobody\u2014just one grain of sand upon a white shore\u2014but I had rather be that than a haunted rock which draws the heavens\u2019 lightnings and is drenched with sacrifice. I seek no throne over white or black, Mameena, who walk my own path to a quiet grave that shall perhaps not be without honour of its own, though other than you seek. I will keep your counsel, Mameena, but, because you are so beautiful and so wise, and because you say you are fond of me\u2014for which I thank you\u2014I pray you put away these fearful dreams of yours that in the end, whether they succeed or fail, will send you shivering from the world to give account of them to the Watcher-on-high.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so, O Macumazana,\u201d she said, with a proud little laugh. \u201cWhen your Watcher sowed my seed\u2014if thus he did\u2014he sowed the dreams that are a part of me also, and I shall only bring him back his own, with the flower and the fruit by way of interest. But that is finished. You refuse the greatness. Now, tell me, if I sink those dreams in a great water, tying about them the stone of forgetfulness and saying: \u2018Sleep there, O dreams; it is not your hour\u2019\u2014if I do this, and stand before you just a woman who loves and who swears by the spirits of her fathers never to think or do that which has not your blessing\u2014will you love me a little, Macumazahn?\u201d\n\nNow I was silent, for she had driven me to the last ditch, and I knew not what to say. Moreover, I will confess my weakness\u2014I was strangely moved. This beautiful girl with the \u201cfire in her heart,\u201d this woman who was different from all other women that I had ever known, seemed to have twisted her slender fingers into my heart-strings and to be drawing me towards her. It was a great temptation, and I bethought me of old Zikali\u2019s saying in the Black Kloof, and seemed to hear his giant laugh.\n\nShe glided up to me, she threw her arms about me and kissed me on the lips, and I think I kissed her back, but really I am not sure what I did or said, for my head swam. When it cleared again she was standing in front of me, looking at me reflectively.\n\n\u201cNow, Macumazahn,\u201d she said, with a little smile that both mocked and dazzled, \u201cthe poor black girl has you, the wise, experienced white man, in her net, and I will show you that she can be generous. Do you think that I do not read your heart, that I do not know that you believe I am dragging you down to shame and ruin? Well, I spare you, Macumazahn, since you have kissed me and spoken words which already you may have forgotten, but which I do not forget. Go your road, Macumazahn, and I go mine, since the proud white man shall not be stained with my black touch. Go your road; but one thing I forbid you\u2014to believe that you have been listening to lies, and that I have merely played off a woman\u2019s arts upon you for my own ends. I love you, Macumazahn, as you will never be loved till you die, and I shall never love any other man, however many I may marry. Moreover, you shall promise me one thing\u2014that once in my life, and once only, if I wish it, you shall kiss me again before all men. And now, lest you should be moved to folly and forget your white man\u2019s pride, I bid you farewell, O Macumazana. When we meet again it will be as friends only.\u201d\n\nThen she went, leaving me feeling smaller than ever I felt in my life, before or since\u2014even smaller than when I walked into the presence of old Zikali the Wise. Why, I wondered, had she first made a fool of me, and then thrown away the fruits of my folly? To this hour I cannot quite answer the question, though I believe the explanation to be that she did really care for me, and was anxious not to involve me in trouble and her plottings; also she may have been wise enough to see that our natures were as oil and water and would never blend.",
    "\u201cGreeting, Umbezi,\u201d said Saduko in his proud manner. \u201cI see that you feast. Am I welcome here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you are always welcome, Saduko,\u201d replied Umbezi uneasily, \u201calthough, as it happens, I am entertaining a great man.\u201d And he looked towards Masapo.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Saduko, eyeing the strangers. \u201cBut which of these may be the great man? I ask that I may salute him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know well enough, _umfokazana_\u201d (that is, low fellow), exclaimed Masapo angrily.\n\n\u201cI know that if you were outside this fence, Masapo, I would cram that word down your throat at the point of my assegai,\u201d replied Saduko in a fierce voice. \u201cOh, I can guess your business here, Masapo, and you can guess mine,\u201d and he glanced towards Mameena. \u201cTell me, Umbezi, is this little chief of the Amansomi your daughter\u2019s accepted suitor?\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, nay, Saduko,\u201d said Umbezi; \u201cno one is her accepted suitor. Will you not sit down and take food with us? Tell us where you have been, and why you return here thus suddenly, and\u2014uninvited?\u201d\n\n\u201cI return here, O Umbezi, to speak with the white chief, Macumazahn. As to where I have been, that is my affair, and not yours or Masapo\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, if I were chief of this kraal,\u201d said Masapo, \u201cI would hunt out of it this hyena with a mangy coat and without a hole who comes to devour your meat and, perhaps,\u201d he added with meaning, \u201cto steal away your child.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I not tell you, Macumazahn, that when two bucks met they would fight?\u201d whispered Mameena suavely into my ear.\n\n\u201cYes, Mameena, you did\u2014or rather I told you. But you did not tell me what the doe would do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doe, Macumazahn, will crouch in her form and see what happens\u2014as is the fashion of does,\u201d and again she laughed softly.\n\n\u201cWhy not do your own hunting, Masapo?\u201d asked Saduko. \u201cCome, now, I will promise you good sport. Outside this kraal there are other hyenas waiting who call me chief\u2014a hundred or two of them\u2014assembled for a certain purpose by the royal leave of King Panda, whose House, as we all know, you hate. Come, leave that beef and beer and begin your hunting of hyenas, O Masapo.\u201d\n\nNow Masapo sat silent, for he saw that he who thought to snare a baboon had caught a tiger.\n\n\u201cYou do not speak, O Chief of the little Amansomi,\u201d went on Saduko, who was beside himself with rage and jealousy. \u201cYou will not leave your beef and beer to hunt the hyenas who are captained by an _umfokazana!_ Well, then, the _umfokazana_ will speak,\u201d and, stepping up to Masapo, with the spear he carried poised in his right hand, Saduko grasped his rival\u2019s short beard with his left.\n\n\u201cListen, Chief,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and I are enemies. You seek the woman I seek, and, mayhap, being rich, you will buy her. But if so, I tell you that I will kill you and all your House, you sneaking, half-bred dog!\u201d\n\nWith these fierce words he spat in his face and tumbled him backwards. Then, before anyone could stop him, for Umbezi, and even Masapo\u2019s headmen, seemed paralysed with surprise, he stalked through the kraal gate, saying as he passed me:\n\n\u201c_Inkoosi_, I have words for you when you are at liberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shall pay for this,\u201d roared Umbezi after him, turning almost green with rage, for Masapo still lay upon his broad back, speechless, \u201cyou who dare to insult my guest in my own house.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody must pay,\u201d cried back Saduko from the gate, \u201cbut who it is only the unborn moons will see.\u201d\n\n\u201cMameena,\u201d I said as I followed him, \u201cyou have set fire to the grass, and men will be burned in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI meant to, Macumazahn,\u201d she answered calmly. \u201cDid I not tell you that there was a flame in me, and it will break out sometimes? But, Macumazahn, it is you who have set fire to the grass, not I. Remember that when half Zululand is in ashes. Farewell, O Macumazana, till we meet again, and,\u201d she added softly, \u201cwhoever else must burn, may the spirits have _you_ in their keeping.\u201d\n\nAt the gate, remembering my manners, I turned to bid that company a polite farewell. By now Masapo had gained his feet, and was roaring out like a bull:\n\n\u201cKill him! Kill the hyena! Umbezi, will you sit still and see me, your guest\u2014me, Masapo\u2014struck and insulted under the shadow of your own hut? Go forth and kill him, I say!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not kill him yourself, Masapo,\u201d asked the agitated Umbezi, \u201cor bid your headmen kill him? Who am I that I should take precedence of so great a chief in a matter of the spear?\u201d Then he turned towards me, saying: \u201cOh, Macumazahn the crafty, if I have dealt well by you, come here and give me your counsel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI come, Eater-up-of-Elephants,\u201d I answered, and I did.\n\n\u201cWhat shall I do\u2014what shall I do?\u201d went on Umbezi, brushing the perspiration off his brow with one hand, while he wrung the other in his agitation. \u201cThere stands a friend of mine\u201d\u2014he pointed to the infuriated Masapo\u2014\u201cwho wishes me to kill another friend of mine,\u201d and he jerked his thumb towards the kraal gate. \u201cIf I refuse I offend one friend, and if I consent I bring blood upon my hands which will call for blood, since, although Saduko is poor, without doubt he has those who love him.\u201d",
    "\u201cWell, Umbezi,\u201d I said, \u201cand how has it fared with you since we parted a year ago? Have you seen anything of Saduko, who, you may remember, left you in some wrath?\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks be to my Spirit, I have seen nothing of that wild man, Macumazahn,\u201d answered Umbezi, shaking his fat old head in a fashion which showed great anxiety. \u201cYet I have heard of him, for he sent me a message the other day to tell me that he had not forgotten what he owed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he mean the sticks with which he promised to bray you like a green hide?\u201d I inquired innocently.\n\n\u201cI think so, Macumazahn\u2014I think so, for certainly he owes me nothing else. And the worst of it is that, there at Panda\u2019s kraal, he has grown like a pumpkin on a dung heap\u2014great, great!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd therefore is now one who can pay any debt that he owes, Umbezi,\u201d I said, taking a pull at the \u201csquareface\u201d and looking at him over the top of the pannikin.\n\n\u201cDoubtless he can, Macumazahn, and, between you and me, that is the real reason why I\u2014or rather Masapo\u2014was so anxious to get those guns. They were not for hunting, as he told you by the messenger, or for war, but to protect us against Saduko, in case he should attack. Well, now I hope we shall be able to hold our own.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and Masapo must teach your people to use them first, Umbezi. But I expect Saduko has forgotten all about both of you now that he is the husband of a princess of the royal blood. Tell me, how goes it with Mameena?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, well, Macumazahn. For is she not the head lady of the Amasomi? There is nothing wrong with her\u2014nothing at all, except that as yet she has no child; also that\u2014,\u201d and he paused.\n\n\u201cThat what?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThat she hates the very sight of her husband, Masapo, and says that she would rather be married to a baboon\u2014yes, to a baboon\u2014than to him, which gives him offence, after he has paid so many cattle for her. But what of this, Macumazahn? There is always a grain missing upon the finest head of corn. Nothing is _quite_ perfect in the world, Macumazahn, and if Mameena does not chance to love her husband\u2014\u201d and he shrugged his shoulders and drank some \u201csquareface.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it does not matter in the least, Umbezi, except to Mameena and her husband, who no doubt will settle down in time, now that Saduko is married to a princess of the Zulu House.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope so, Macumazahn, but, to tell the truth, I wish you had brought more guns, for I live amongst a terrible lot of people. Masapo, who is furious with Mameena because she will have none of him, and therefore with me, as though _I_ could control Mameena; Mameena, who is mad with Masapo, and therefore with me, because I gave her in marriage to him; Saduko, who foams at the mouth at the name of Masapo, because he has married Mameena, whom, it is said, he still loves, and therefore at me, because I am her father and did my best to settle her in the world. Oh, give me some more of that fire-water, Macumazahn, for it makes me forget all these things, and especially that my guardian spirit made me the father of Mameena, with whom you would not run away when you might have done so. Oh, Macumazahn, why did you not run away with Mameena, and turn her into a quiet white woman who ties herself up in sacks, sings songs to the \u2018Great-Great\u2019 in the sky\u2014[that is, hymns to the Power above us]\u2014and never thinks of any man who is not her husband?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause if I had done so, Umbezi, I should have ceased to be a quiet white man. Yes, yes, my friend, I should have been in some such place as yours to-day, and that is the last thing that I wish. And now, Umbezi, you have had quite enough \u2018squareface,\u2019 so I will take the bottle away with me. Good-night.\u201d",
    "In due course I reached Nodwengu without accident, having sent forward one of my hunters to report my approach to Panda. When my wagons arrived outside the Great Place they were met by none other than my old friend, Maputa, he who had brought me back the pills before our attack upon Bangu. \u201cGreeting, Macumazahn,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sent by the King to say that you are welcome and to point you out a good place to outspan; also to give you permission to trade as much as you will in this town, since he knows that your dealings are always fair.\u201d\n\nI returned my thanks in the usual fashion, adding that I had brought a little present for the King which I would deliver when it pleased him to receive me. Then I invited Maputa, to whom I also offered some trifle which delighted him very much, to ride with me on the wagon-box till we came to the selected outspan. This, by the way, proved, to be a very good place indeed, a little valley full of grass for the cattle\u2014for by the King\u2019s order it had not been grazed\u2014with a stream of beautiful water running down it. Moreover it overlooked a great open space immediately in front of the main gate of the town, so that I could see everything that went on and all who arrived or departed.\n\n\u201cYou will be comfortable here, Macumazahn,\u201d said Maputa, \u201cduring your stay, which we hope will be long, since, although there will soon be a mighty crowd at Nodwengu, the King has given orders that none except your own servants are to enter this valley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank the King; but why will there be a crowd, Maputa?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d he answered with a shrug of the shoulders, \u201cbecause of a new thing. All the tribes of the Zulus are to come up to be reviewed. Some say that Cetewayo has brought this about, and some say that it is Umbelazi. But I am sure that it is the work of neither of these, but of Saduko, your old friend, though what his object is I cannot tell you. I only trust,\u201d he added uneasily, \u201cthat it will not end in bloodshed between the Great Brothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Saduko has grown tall, Maputa?\u201d\n\n\u201cTall as a tree, Macumazahn. His whisper in the King\u2019s ear is louder than the shouts of others. Moreover, he has become a \u2018self-eater\u2019 [that is a Zulu term which means one who is very haughty]. You will have to wait on him, Macumazahn; he will not wait on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it so?\u201d I answered. \u201cWell, tall trees are blown down sometimes.\u201d\n\nHe nodded his wise old head. \u201cYes, Macumazahn; I have seen plenty grow and fall in my time, for at last the swimmer goes with the stream. Anyhow, you will be able to do a good trade among so many, and, whatever happens, none will harm you whom all love. And now farewell; I bear your messages to the King, who sends an ox for you to kill lest you should grow hungry in his house.\u201d\n\nThat same evening I saw Saduko and the others, as I shall tell. I had been up to visit the King and give him my present, a case of English table-knives with bone handles, which pleased him greatly, although he did not in the least know how to use them. Indeed, without their accompanying forks these are somewhat futile articles. I found the old fellow very tired and anxious, but as he was surrounded by _indunas_, I had no private talk with him. Seeing that he was busy, I took my leave as soon as I could, and when I walked away whom should I meet but Saduko.\n\nI saw him while he was a good way off, advancing towards the inner gate with a train of attendants like a royal personage, and knew very well that he saw me. Making up my mind what to do at once, I walked straight on to him, forcing him to give me the path, which he did not wish to do before so many people, and brushed past him as though he were a stranger. As I expected, this treatment had the desired effect, for after we had passed each other he turned and said:\n\n\u201cDo you not know me, Macumazahn?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho calls?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy, friend, your face is familiar to me. How are you named?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you forgotten Saduko?\u201d he said in a pained voice.\n\n\u201cNo, no, of course not,\u201d I answered. \u201cI know you now, although you seem somewhat changed since we went out hunting and fighting together\u2014I suppose because you are fatter. I trust that you are well, Saduko? Good-bye. I must be going back to my wagons. If you wish to see me you will find me there.\u201d\n\nThese remarks, I may add, seemed to take Saduko very much aback. At any rate, he found no reply to them, even when old Maputa, with whom I was walking, and some others sniggered aloud. There is nothing that Zulus enjoy so much as seeing one whom they consider an upstart set in his place.\n\nWell, a couple of hours afterwards, just as the sun was sinking, who should walk up to my wagons but Saduko himself, accompanied by a woman whom I recognised at once as his wife, the Princess Nandie, who carried a fine baby boy in her arms. Rising, I saluted Nandie and offered her my camp-stool, which she looked at suspiciously and declined, preferring to seat herself on the ground after the native fashion. So I took it back again, and after I had sat down on it, not before, stretched out my hand to Saduko, who by this time was quite humble and polite.\n\nWell, we talked away, and by degrees, without seeming too much interested in them, I was furnished with a list of all the advancements which it had pleased Panda to heap upon Saduko during the past year. In their way they were remarkable enough, for it was much as though some penniless country gentleman in England had been promoted in that short space of time to be one of the premier peers of the kingdom and endowed with great offices and estates. When he had finished the count of them he paused, evidently waiting for me to congratulate him. But all I said was:\n\n\u201cBy the Heavens above I am sorry for you, Saduko! How many enemies you must have made! What a long way there will be for you to fall one night!\u201d\u2014a remark at which the quiet Nandie broke into a low laugh that I think pleased her husband even less than my sarcasm. \u201cWell,\u201d I went on, \u201cI see that you have got a baby, which is much better than all these titles. May I look at it, _Inkosazana?_\u201d\n\nOf course she was delighted, and we proceeded to inspect the baby, which evidently she loved more than anything on earth. Whilst we were examining the child and chatting about it, Saduko sitting by meanwhile in the sulks, who on earth should appear but Mameena and her fat and sullen-looking husband, the chief Masapo.\n\n\u201cOh, Macumazahn,\u201d she said, appearing to notice no one else, \u201chow pleased I am to see you after a whole long year!\u201d\n\nI stared at her and my jaw dropped. Then I recovered myself, thinking she must have made a mistake and meant to say \u201cweek.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwelve moons,\u201d she went on, \u201cand, Macumazahn, not one of them has gone by but I have thought of you several times and wondered if we should ever meet again. Where have you been all this while?\u201d",
    "I should add that, except for the remission of the case to the court of the witch-doctor, which, of course, was an instance of pure Kafir superstition, this judgment of the King\u2019s seemed to me well reasoned and just, very different indeed from what would have been given by Dingaan or Chaka, who were wont, on less evidence, to make a clean sweep not only of the accused, but of all his family and dependents.\n\nAbout eight days later, during which time I had heard nothing of the matter and seen no one connected with it, for the whole thing seemed to have become _Zila_\u2014that is, not to be talked about\u2014I received a summons to attend the \u201csmelling-out,\u201d and went, wondering what witch-doctor had been chosen for that bloody and barbarous ceremony. Indeed, I had not far to go, since the place selected for the occasion was outside the fence of the town of Nodwengu, on that great open stretch of ground which lay at the mouth of the valley where I was camped. Here, as I approached, I saw a vast multitude of people crowded together, fifty deep or more, round a little oval space not much larger than the pit of a theatre. On the inmost edge of this ring were seated many notable people, male and female, and as I was conducted to the side of it which was nearest to the gate of the town, I observed among them Saduko, Masapo, Mameena and others, and mixed up with them a number of soldiers, who were evidently on duty.\n\nScarcely had I seated myself on a camp-stool, carried by my servant Scowl, when through the gate of the kraal issued Panda and certain of his Council, whose appearance the multitude greeted with the royal salute of _Bay\u00e9te_, that came from them in a deep and simultaneous roar of sound. When its echoes died away, in the midst of a deep silence Panda spoke, saying:\n\n\u201cBring forth the Nyanga [doctor]. Let the _umhlahlo_ [that is, the witch-trial] begin!\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause, and then in the open gateway appeared a solitary figure that at first sight seemed to be scarcely human, the figure of a dwarf with a gigantic head, from which hung long, white hair, plaited into locks. It was Zikali, no other!\n\nQuite unattended, and naked save for his moocha, for he had on him none of the ordinary paraphernalia of the witch-doctor, he waddled forward with a curious toad-like gait till he had passed through the Councillors and stood in the open space of the ring. Halting there, he looked about him slowly with his deep-set eyes, turning as he looked, till at length his glance fell upon the King.\n\n\u201cWhat would you have of me, Son of Senzangakona?\u201d he asked. \u201cMany years have passed since last we met. Why do you drag me from my hut, I who have visited the kraal of the King of the Zulus but twice since the \u2018Black One\u2019 [Chaka] sat upon the throne\u2014once when the Boers were killed by him who went before you, and once when I was brought forth to see all who were left of my race, shoots of the royal Dwandwe stock, slain before my eyes. Do you bear me hither that I may follow them into the darkness, O Child of Senzangakona? If so I am ready; only then I have words to say that it may not please you to hear.\u201d\n\nHis deep, rumbling voice echoed into silence, while the great audience waited for the King\u2019s answer. I could see that they were all afraid of this man, yes, even Panda was afraid, for he shifted uneasily upon his stool. At length he spoke, saying:\n\n\u201cNot so, O Zikali. Who would wish to do hurt to the wisest and most ancient man in all the land, to him who touches the far past with one hand and the present with the other, to him who was old before our grandfathers began to be? Nay, you are safe, you on whom not even the \u2018Black One\u2019 dared to lay a finger, although you were his enemy and he hated you. As for the reason why you have been brought here, tell it to us, O Zikali. Who are we that we should instruct you in the ways of wisdom?\u201d\n\nWhen the dwarf heard this he broke into one of his great laughs.\n\n\u201cSo at last the House of Senzangakona acknowledges that I have wisdom. Then before all is done they will think me wise indeed.\u201d\n\nHe laughed again in his ill-omened fashion and went on hurriedly, as though he feared that he should be called upon to explain his words:\n\n\u201cWhere is the fee? Where is the fee? Is the King so poor that he expects an old Dwandwe doctor to divine for nothing, just as though he were working for a private friend?\u201d\n\nPanda made a motion with his hand, and ten fine heifers were driven into the circle from some place where they had been kept in waiting.\n\n\u201cSorry beasts!\u201d said Zikali contemptuously, \u201ccompared to those we used to breed before the time of Senzangakona\u201d\u2014a remark which caused a loud \u201c_Wow!_\u201d of astonishment to be uttered by the multitude that heard it. \u201cStill, such as they are, let them be taken to my kraal, with a bull, for I have none.\u201d\n\nThe cattle were driven away, and the ancient dwarf squatted himself down and stared at the ground, looking like a great black toad. For a long while\u2014quite ten minutes, I should think\u2014he stared thus, till I, for one, watching him intently, began to feel as though I were mesmerised.",
    "Now, Panda looked much disturbed, as was not wonderful, since, rushing out from the fence behind which they had been listening, Umqumbazi, Cetewayo\u2019s mother, whispered into one of his ears, while Umbelazi\u2019s mother whispered into the other. What advice each of them gave I do not know, although obviously it was not the same advice, since the poor man rolled his eyes first at one and then at the other, and finally put his hands over his ears that he might hear no more.\n\n\u201cChoose, choose, O King!\u201d shouted the audience. \u201cWho is to succeed you, Cetewayo or Umbelazi?\u201d\n\nWatching Panda, I saw that he fell into a kind of agony; his fat sides heaved, and, although the day was cold, sweat ran from his brow.\n\n\u201cWhat would the white men do in such a case?\u201d he said to me in a hoarse, low voice, whereon I answered, looking at the ground and speaking so that few could hear me:\n\n\u201cI think, O King, that a white man would do nothing. He would say that others might settle the matter after he was dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould that I could say so, too,\u201d muttered Panda; \u201cbut it is not possible.\u201d\n\nThen followed a long pause, during which all were silent, for every man there felt that the hour was big with doom. At length Panda rose with difficulty, because of his unwieldy weight, and uttered these fateful words, that were none the less ominous because of the homely idiom in which they were couched:\n\n\u201c_When two young bulls quarrel they must fight it out._\u201d\n\nInstantly in one tremendous roar volleyed forth the royal salute of _Bay\u00e9te_, a signal of the acceptance of the King\u2019s word\u2014the word that meant civil war and the death of many thousands.\n\nThen Panda turned and, so feebly that I thought he would fall, walked through the gateway behind him, followed by the rival queens. Each of these ladies struggled to be first after him in the gate, thinking that it would be an omen of success for her son. Finally, however, to the disappointment of the multitude, they only succeeded in passing it side by side.\n\nWhen they had gone the great audience began to break up, the men of each party marching away together as though by common consent, without offering any insult or molestation to their adversaries. I think that this peaceable attitude arose, however, from the knowledge that matters had now passed from the stage of private quarrel into that of public war. It was felt that their dispute awaited decision, not with sticks outside the Nodwengu kraal, but with spears upon some great battlefield, for which they went to prepare.\n\nWithin two days, except for those regiments which Panda kept to guard his person, scarcely a soldier was to be seen in the neighbourhood of Nodwengu. The princes also departed to muster their adherents, Cetewayo establishing himself among the Mandhlakazi that he commanded, and Umbelazi returning to the kraal of Umbezi, which happened to stand almost in the centre of that part of the nation which adhered to him.\n\nWhether he took Mameena with him there I am not certain. I believe, however, that, fearing lest her welcome at her birthplace should be warmer than she wished, she settled herself at some retired and outlying kraal in the neighbourhood, and there awaited the crisis of her fortune. At any rate, I saw nothing of her, for she was careful to keep out of my way.\n\nWith Umbelazi and Saduko, however, I did have an interview. Before they left Nodwengu they called on me together, apparently on the best of terms, and said in effect that they hoped for my support in the coming war.\n\nI answered that, however well I might like them personally, a Zulu civil war was no affair of mine, and that, indeed, for every reason, including the supreme one of my own safety, I had better get out of the way at once.\n\nThey argued with me for a long while, making great offers and promises of reward, till at length, when he saw that my determination could not be shaken, Umbelazi said:\n\n\u201cCome, Saduko, let us humble ourselves no more before this white man. After all, he is right; the business is none of his, and why should we ask him to risk his life in our quarrel, knowing as we do that white men are not like us; they think a great deal of their lives. Farewell, Macumazahn. If I conquer and grow great you will always be welcome in Zululand, whereas if I fail perhaps you will be best over the Tugela river.\u201d\n\nNow, I felt the hidden taunt in this speech very keenly. Still, being determined that for once I would be wise and not allow my natural curiosity and love of adventure to drag me into more risks and trouble, I replied:\n\n\u201cThe Prince says that I am not brave and love my life, and what he says is true. I fear fighting, who by nature am a trader with the heart of a trader, not a warrior with the heart of a warrior, like the great _Indhlovu-ene-Sihlonti_\u201d\u2014words at which I saw the grave Saduko smile faintly. \u201cSo farewell to you, Prince, and may good fortune attend you.\u201d\n\nOf course, to call the Prince to his face by this nickname, which referred to a defect in his person, was something of an insult; but I had been insulted, and meant to give him \u201ca Roland for his Oliver.\u201d However, he took it in good part.",
    "\u201cSee their plan?\u201d he said. \u201cThey would close on Umbelazi and gore him with their horns and then charge with their head. The horn will pass between us and the right flank of the _Isigqosa_. Oh! awake, awake, Elephant! Are you asleep with Mameena in a hut? Unloose your spears, Child of the King, and at them as they mount the slope. Behold!\u201d he went on, \u201cit is the Son of Dunn that begins the battle! Did I not tell you that we must look to the white men to show us the way? Peep through your tube, Macumazahn, and tell me what passes.\u201d\n\nSo I \u201cpeeped,\u201d and, the telescope which John Dunn had kindly left with me being good though small, saw everything clearly enough. He rode up almost to the point of the left horn of the _Usutu_, waving a white handkerchief and followed by his small force of police and Natal Kafirs. Then from somewhere among the _Usutu_ rose a puff of smoke. Dunn had been fired at.\n\nHe dropped the handkerchief and leapt to the ground. Now he and his police were firing rapidly in reply, and men fell fast among the _Usutu_. They raised their war shout and came on, though slowly, for they feared the bullets. Step by step John Dunn and his people were thrust back, fighting gallantly against overwhelming odds. They were level with us, not a quarter of a mile to our left. They were pushed past us. They vanished among the bush behind us, and a long while passed before ever I heard what became of them, for we met no more that day.\n\nNow, the horns having done their work and wrapped themselves round Umbelazi\u2019s army as the nippers of a wasp close about a fly (why did not Umbelazi cut off those horns, I wondered), the _Usutu_ bull began his charge. Twenty or thirty thousand strong, regiment after regiment, Cetewayo\u2019s men rushed up the slope, and there, near the crest of it, were met by Umbelazi\u2019s regiments springing forward to repel the onslaught and shouting their battle-cry of \u201c_Laba! Laba! Laba! Laba!_\u201d\n\nThe noise of their meeting shields came to our ears like that of the roll of thunder, and the sheen of their stabbing-spears shone as shines the broad summer lightning. They hung and wavered on the slope; then from the Amawombe ranks rose a roar of \u201c_Umbelazi wins!_\u201d\n\nWatching intently, we saw the _Usutu_ giving back. Down the slope they went, leaving the ground in front of them covered with black spots which we knew to be dead or wounded men.\n\n\u201cWhy does not the Elephant charge home?\u201d said Maputa in a perplexed voice. \u201cThe _Usutu_ bull is on his back! Why does he not trample him?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he is afraid, I suppose,\u201d I answered, and went on watching.\n\nThere was plenty to see, as it happened. Finding that they were not pursued, Cetewayo\u2019s _impi_ reformed swiftly at the bottom of the slope, in preparation for another charge. Among that of Umbelazi, above them, rapid movements took place of which I could not guess the meaning, which movements were accompanied by much noise of angry shouting. Then suddenly, from the midst of the _Isigqosa_ army, emerged a great body of men, thousands strong, which ran swiftly, but in open order, down the slope towards the _Usutu_, holding their spears reversed. At first I thought that they were charging independently, till I saw the _Usutu_ ranks open to receive them with a shout of welcome.\n\n\u201cTreachery!\u201d I said. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaduko, with the Amakoba and Amangwane soldiers and others. I know them by their head-dresses,\u201d answered Maputa in a cold voice.\n\n\u201cDo you mean that Saduko has gone over to Cetewayo with all his following?\u201d I asked excitedly.\n\n\u201cWhat else, Macumazahn? Saduko is a traitor: Umbelazi is finished,\u201d and he passed his hand swiftly across his mouth\u2014a gesture that has only one meaning among the Zulus.\n\nAs for me, I sat down upon a stone and groaned, for now I understood everything.\n\n\nPresently the _Usutu_ raised fierce, triumphant shouts, and once again their impi, swelled with Saduko\u2019s power, began to advance up the slope. Umbelazi, and those of the _Isigqosa_ party who clung to him\u2014now, I should judge, not more than eight thousand men\u2014never stayed to wait the onslaught. They broke! They fled in a hideous rout, crashing through the thin, left horn of the _Usutu_ by mere weight of numbers, and passing behind us obliquely on their road to the banks of the Tugela. A messenger rushed up to us, panting.\n\n\u201cThese are the words of Umbelazi,\u201d he gasped. \u201cO Watcher-by-Night and O Maputa, _Indhlovu-ene-Sihlonti_ prays that you will hold back the _Usutu_, as the King bade you do in case of need, and so give to him and those who cling to him time to escape with the women and children into Natal. His general, Saduko, has betrayed him, and gone over with three regiments to Cetewayo, and therefore we can no longer stand against the thousands of the _Usutu_.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo tell the prince that Macumazahn, Maputa, and the Amawombe regiment will do their best,\u201d answered Maputa calmly. \u201cStill, this is our advice to him, that he should cross the Tugela swiftly with the women and the children, seeing that we are few and Cetewayo is many.\u201d\n\nThe messenger leapt away, but, as I heard afterwards, he never found Umbelazi, since the poor man was killed within five hundred yards of where we stood.\n\nThen Maputa gave an order, and the Amawombe formed themselves into a triple line, thirteen hundred men in the first line, thirteen hundred men in the second line, and about a thousand in the third, behind whom were the carrier boys, three or four hundred of them. The place assigned to me was in the exact centre of the second line, where, being mounted on a horse, it was thought, as I gathered, that I should serve as a convenient rallying-point.\n\nIn this formation we advanced a few hundred yards to our left, evidently with the object of interposing ourselves between the routed impi and the pursuing _Usutu_, or, if the latter should elect to go round us, with that of threatening their flank. Cetewayo\u2019s generals did not leave us long in doubt as to what they would do. The main body of their army bore away to the right in pursuit of the flying foe, but three regiments, each of about two thousand five hundred spears, halted. Five minutes passed perhaps while they marshalled, with a distance of some six hundred yards between them. Each regiment was in a triple line like our own.",
    "The case of Saduko was taken first. An officer learned in Zulu law\u2014which I can assure the reader is a very intricate and well-established law\u2014I suppose that he might be called a kind of attorney-general, rose and stated the case against the prisoner. He told how Saduko, from a nobody, had been lifted to a great place by the King and given his daughter, the Princess Nandie, in marriage. Then he alleged that, as would be proved in evidence, the said Saduko had urged on Umbelazi the Prince, to whose party he had attached himself, to make war upon Cetewayo. This war having begun, at the great battle of Endondakusuka, he had treacherously deserted Umbelazi, together with three regiments under his command, and gone over to Cetewayo, thereby bringing Umbelazi to defeat and death.\n\nThis brief statement of the case for the prosecution being finished, Panda asked Saduko whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty.\n\n\u201cGuilty, O King,\u201d he answered, and was silent.\n\nThen Panda asked him if he had anything to say in excuse of his conduct.\n\n\u201cNothing, O King, except that I was Umbelazi\u2019s man, and when you, O King, had given the word that he and the Prince yonder might fight, I, like many others, some of whom are dead and some alive, worked for him with all my ten fingers that he might have the victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why did you desert my son the Prince in the battle?\u201d asked Panda.\n\n\u201cBecause I saw that the Prince Cetewayo was the stronger bull and wished to be on the winning side, as all men do\u2014for no other reason,\u201d answered Saduko calmly.\n\nNow, everyone present stared, not excepting Cetewayo. Panda, who, like the rest of us, had heard a very different tale, looked extremely puzzled, while Zikali, in his corner, set up one of his great laughs.\n\n\nAfter a long pause, at length the King, as supreme judge, began to pass sentence. At least, I suppose that was his intention, but before three words had left his lips Nandie rose and said: \u201cMy Father, ere you speak that which cannot be unspoken, hear me. It is well known that Saduko, my husband, was my brother Umbelazi\u2019s general and councillor, and if he is to be killed for clinging to the Prince, then I should be killed also, and countless others in Zululand who still remain alive because they were not in or escaped the battle. It is well known also, my Father, that during that battle Saduko went over to my brother Cetewayo, though whether this brought about the defeat of Umbelazi I cannot say. Why did he go over? He tells you because he wished to be on the winning side. It is not true. He went over in order to be revenged upon Umbelazi, who had taken from him yonder witch\u201d\u2014and she pointed with her finger at Mameena\u2014\u201cyonder witch, whom he loved and still loves, and whom even now he would shield, even though to do so he must make his own name shameful. Saduko sinned; I do not deny it, my Father, but there sits the real traitress, red with the blood of Umbelazi and with that of thousands of others who have \u2018_tshonile_\u2019d\u2019 [gone down to keep him company among the ghosts]. Therefore, O King, I beseech you, spare the life of Saduko, my husband, or, if he must die, learn that I, your daughter, will die with him. I have spoken, O King.\u201d\n\nAnd very proudly and quietly she sat herself down again, waiting for the fateful words.\n\nBut those words were not spoken, since Panda only said: \u201cLet us try the case of this woman, Mameena.\u201d\n\nThereon the law officer rose again and set out the charges against Mameena, namely, that it was she who had poisoned Saduko\u2019s child, and not Masapo; that, after marrying Saduko, she had deserted him and gone to live with the Prince Umbelazi; and that finally she had bewitched the said Umbelazi and caused him to make civil war in the land.\n\n\u201cThe second charge, if proved, namely, that this woman deserted her husband for another man, is a crime of death,\u201d broke in Panda abruptly as the officer finished speaking; \u201ctherefore, what need is there to hear the first and the third until that is examined. What do you plead to that charge, woman?\u201d\n\nNow, understanding that the King did not wish to stir up these other matters of murder and witchcraft for some reason of his own, we all turned to hear Mameena\u2019s answer.\n\n\u201cO King,\u201d she said in her low, silvery voice, \u201cI cannot deny that I left Saduko for Umbelazi the Handsome, any more than Saduko can deny that he left Umbelazi the beaten for Cetewayo the conqueror.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you leave Saduko?\u201d asked Panda.\n\n\u201cO King, perhaps because I loved Umbelazi; for was he not called the Handsome? Also _you_ know that the Prince, your son, was one to be loved.\u201d Here she paused, looking at poor Panda, who winced. \u201cOr, perhaps, because I wished to be great; for was he not of the Blood Royal, and, had it not been for Saduko, would he not one day have been a king? Or, perhaps, because I could no longer bear the treatment that the Princess Nandie dealt out to me; she who was cruel to me and threatened to beat me, because Saduko loved my hut better than her own. Ask Saduko; he knows more of these matters than I do,\u201d and she gazed at him steadily. Then she went on: \u201cHow can a woman tell her reasons, O King, when she never knows them herself?\u201d\u2014a question at which some of her hearers smiled.\n\nNow Saduko rose and said slowly: \u201cHear me, O King, and I will give the reason that Mameena hides. She left me for Umbelazi because I bade her to do so, for I knew that Umbelazi desired her, and I wished to tie the cord tighter which bound me to one who at that time I thought would inherit the Throne. Also, I was weary of Mameena, who quarrelled night and day with the Princess Nandie, my _Inkosikazi_.\u201d\n\nNow Nandie gasped in astonishment (and so did I), but Mameena laughed and said: \u201cYes, O King, those were the two real reasons that I had forgotten. I left Saduko because he bade me, as he wished to make a present to the Prince. Also, he _was_ tired of me; for many days at a time he would scarcely speak to me, because, however kind she might be, I could not help quarrelling with the Princess Nandie. Moreover, there was another reason which I have forgotten: I had no child, and not having any child I did not think it mattered whether I went or stayed. If Saduko searches, he will remember that I told him so, and that he agreed with me.\u201d\n\nAgain she looked at Saduko, who said hurriedly: \u201cYes, yes, I told her so; I told her that I wished for no barren cows in my kraal.\u201d\n\nNow some of the audience laughed outright, but Panda frowned. \u201cIt seems,\u201d he said, \u201cthat my ears are being stuffed with lies, though which of these two tells them I cannot say. Well, if the woman left the man by his own wish, and that his ends might be furthered, as he says, he had put her away, and therefore the fault, if any, is his, not hers. So that charge is ended. Now, woman, what have you to tell us of the witchcraft which it is said you practised upon the Prince who is gone, thereby causing him to make war in the land?\u201d",
    "The King began to speak. \u201cMameena,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have heard. Have you aught to say? For if not it would seem that you are a witch and a murderess, and one who must die.\u201d\n\n\u201cYea, a little word, O King,\u201d she answered quietly. \u201cNahana speaks truth. It is true that I entered the hut of Nandie and set the medicine there. I say it because by nature I am not one who hides the truth or would attempt to throw discredit even upon a humble serving-woman,\u201d and she glanced at Nahana.\n\n\u201cThen from between your own teeth it is finished,\u201d said Panda.\n\n\u201cNot altogether, O King. I have said that I set the medicine in the hut. I have not said, and I will not say, how and why I set it there. That tale I call upon Saduko yonder to tell to you, he who was my husband, that I left for Umbelazi, and who, being a man, must therefore hate me. By the words he says I will abide. If he declares that I am guilty, then I am guilty, and prepared to pay the price of guilt. But if he declares that I am innocent, then, O King and O Prince Cetewayo, without fear I trust myself to your justness. Now speak, O Saduko; speak the whole truth, whatever it may be, if that is the King\u2019s will.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my will,\u201d said Panda.\n\n\u201cAnd mine also,\u201d added Cetewayo, who, I could see, like everyone else, was much interested in this matter.\n\n\nSaduko rose to his feet, the same Saduko that I had always known, and yet so changed. All the life and fire had gone from him; his pride in himself was no more; none could have known him for that ambitious, confident man who, in his day of power, the Zulus named the \u201cSelf-Eater.\u201d He was a mere mask of the old Saduko, informed by some new, some alien, spirit. With dull, lack-lustre eyes fixed always upon the lovely eyes of Mameena, in slow and hesitating tones he began his tale.  \u201cIt is true, O Lion,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Mameena spread the poison upon my child\u2019s mat. It is true that she set the deadly charms in the doorway of Nandie\u2019s hut. These things she did, not knowing what she did, and it was I who instructed her to do them. This is the case. From the beginning I have always loved Mameena as I have loved no other woman and as no other woman was ever loved. But while I was away with Macumazahn, who sits yonder, to destroy Bangu, chief of the Amakoba, he who had killed my father, Umbezi, the father of Mameena, he whom the Prince Cetewayo gave to the vultures the other day because he had lied as to the death of Umbelazi, he, I say, forced Mameena, against her will, to marry Masapo the Boar, who afterwards was executed for wizardry. Now, here at your feast, when you reviewed the people of the Zulus, O King, after you had given me the lady Nandie as wife, Mameena and I met again and loved each other more than we had ever done before. But, being an upright woman, Mameena thrust me away from her, saying: \u2018I have a husband, who, if he is not dear to me, still is my husband, and while he lives to him I will be true.\u2019 Then, O King, I took counsel with the evil in my heart, and made a plot in myself to be rid of the Boar, Masapo, so that when he was dead I might marry Mameena. This was the plot that I made\u2014that my son and Princess Nandie\u2019s should be poisoned, and that Masapo should seem to poison him, so that he might be killed as a wizard and I marry Mameena.\u201d\n\nNow, at this astounding statement, which was something beyond the experience of the most cunning and cruel savage present there, a gasp of astonishment went up from the audience; even old Zikali lifted his head and stared. Nandie, too, shaken out of her usual calm, rose as though to speak; then, looking first at Saduko and next at Mameena, sat herself down again and waited. But Saduko went on again in the same cold, measured voice: \u201cI gave Mameena a powder which I had bought for two heifers from a great doctor who lived beyond the Tugela, but who is now dead, which powder I told her was desired by Nandie, my _Inkosikazi_, to destroy the little beetles that ran about the hut, and directed her where she was to spread it. Also, I gave her the bag of medicine, telling her to thrust it into the doorway of the hut, that it might bring a blessing upon my House. These things she did ignorantly to please me, not knowing that the powder was poison, not knowing that the medicine was bewitched. So my child died, as I wished it to die, and, indeed, I myself fell sick because by accident I touched the powder. Afterwards Masapo was smelt out as a wizard by old Zikali, I having caused a bag of the poison to be sewn in his kaross in order to deceive Zikali, and killed by your order, O King, and Mameena was given to me as a wife, also by your order, O King, which was what I desired. Later on, as I have told you, I wearied of her, and wishing to please the Prince who has wandered away, I commanded her to yield herself to him, which Mameena did out of her love for me and to advance my fortunes, she who is blameless in all things.\u201d\n\nSaduko finished speaking and sat down again, as an automaton might do when a wire is pulled, his lack-lustre eyes still fixed upon Mameena\u2019s face.  \u201cYou have heard, O King,\u201d said Mameena. \u201cNow pass judgment, knowing that, if it be your will, I am ready to die for Saduko\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n\nBut Panda sprang up in a rage. \u201c_Take him away!_\u201d he said, pointing to Saduko. \u201cTake away that dog who is not fit to live, a dog who eats his own child that thereby he may cause another to be slain unjustly and steal his wife.\u201d\n\nThe executioners leapt forward, and, having something to say, for I could bear this business no longer, I began to rise to my feet. Before I gained them, however, Zikali was speaking. \u201cO King,\u201d he said, \u201cit seems that you have killed one man unjustly on this matter, namely, Masapo. Would you do the same by another?\u201d and he pointed to Saduko."

  "H. Rider Haggard -- Ayesha, the Return of She": [
    "Hard on twenty years have gone by since that night of Leo\u2019s vision--the most awful years, perhaps, which were ever endured by men--twenty years of search and hardship ending in soul-shaking wonder and amazement. My death is very near to me, and of this I am glad, for I desire to pursue the quest in other realms, as it has been promised to me that I shall do. I desire to learn the beginning and the end of the spiritual drama of which it has been my strange lot to read some pages upon earth.\n\nI, Ludwig Horace Holly, have been very ill; they carried me, more dead than alive, down those mountains whose lowest slopes I can see from my window, for I write this on the northern frontiers of India. Indeed any other man had long since perished, but Destiny kept my breath in me, perhaps that a record might remain. I must bide here a month or two till I am strong enough to travel homewards, for I have a fancy to die in the place where I was born. So while I have strength I will put the story down, or at least those parts of it that are most essential, for much can, or at any rate must, be omitted. I shrink from attempting too long a book, though my notes and memory would furnish me with sufficient material for volumes.\n\nI will begin with the Vision.\n\nAfter Leo Vincey and I came back from Africa in 1885, desiring solitude, which indeed we needed sorely to recover from the fearful shock we had experienced, and to give us time and opportunity to think, we went to an old house upon the shores of Cumberland that has belonged to my family for many generations. This house, unless somebody has taken it believing me to be dead, is still my property and thither I travel to die.\n\nThose whose eyes read the words I write, if any should ever read them, may ask--What shock?\n\nWell, I am Horace Holly, and my companion, my beloved friend, my son in the spirit whom I reared from infancy was--nay, is--Leo Vincey. We are those men who, following an ancient clue, travelled to the Caves of K\u00f4r in Central Africa, and there discovered her whom we sought, the immortal _She-who-must-be-obeyed_. In Leo she found her love, that re-born Kallikrates, the Grecian priest of Isis whom some two thousand years before she had slain in her jealous rage, thus executing on him the judgment of the angry goddess. In her also I found the divinity whom I was doomed to worship from afar, not with the flesh, for that is all lost and gone from me, but, what is sorer still, because its burden is undying, with the will and soul which animate a man throughout the countless eons of his being. The flesh dies, or at least it changes, and its passions pass, but that other passion of the spirit--that longing for oneness--is undying as itself.\n\nWhat crime have I committed that this sore punishment should be laid upon me? Yet, in truth, is it a punishment? May it not prove to be but that black and terrible Gate which leads to the joyous palace of Rewards? She swore that I should ever be her friend and his and dwell with them eternally, and I believe her.\n\nFor how many winters did we wander among the icy hills and deserts! Still, at length, the Messenger came and led us to the Mountain, and on the Mountain we found the Shrine, and in the Shrine the Spirit. May not these things be an allegory prepared for our instruction? I will take comfort. I will hope that it is so. Nay, I am sure that it is so.\n\nIt will be remembered that in K\u00f4r we found the immortal woman. There before the flashing rays and vapours of the Pillar of Life she declared her mystic love, and then in our very sight was swept to a doom so horrible that even now, after all which has been and gone, I shiver at its recollection. Yet what were Ayesha\u2019s last words? \u201c_Forget me not . . . have pity on my shame. I die not. I shall come again and shall once more be beautiful. I swear it--it is true._\u201d\n\nWell, I cannot set out that history afresh. Moreover it is written; the man whom I trusted in the matter did not fail me, and the book he made of it seems to be known throughout the world, for I have found it here in English, yes, and read it first translated into Hindostani. To it then I refer the curious.\n\nIn that house upon the desolate sea-shore of Cumberland, we dwelt a year, mourning the lost, seeking an avenue by which it might be found again and discovering none. Here our strength came back to us, and Leo\u2019s hair, that had been whitened in the horror of the Caves, grew again from grey to golden. His beauty returned to him also, so that his face was as it had been, only purified and saddened.\n\nWell I remember that night--and the hour of illumination. We were heart-broken, we were in despair. We sought signs and could find none. The dead remained dead to us and no answer came to all our crying.\n\nIt was a sullen August evening, and after we had dined we walked upon the shore, listening to the slow surge of the waves and watching the lightning flicker from the bosom of a distant cloud. In silence we walked, till at last Leo groaned--it was more of a sob than a groan--and clasped my arm.\n\n\u201cI can bear it no longer, Horace,\u201d he said--for so he called me now--\u201cI am in torment. The desire to see Ayesha once more saps my brain. Without hope I shall go quite mad. And I am strong, I may live another fifty years.\u201d",
    "The mountain-side was moving down upon us in a vast avalanche of snow.\n\nOh! what a sight was that. On from the crest of the precipitous slopes above, two miles and more away, it came, a living thing, rolling, sliding, gliding; piling itself in long, leaping waves, hollowing itself into cavernous valleys, like a tempest-driven sea, whilst above its surface hung a powdery cloud of frozen spray.\n\nAs we watched, clinging to each other terrified, the first of these waves struck our hill, causing the mighty mass of solid rock to quiver like a yacht beneath the impact of an ocean roller, or an aspen in a sudden rush of wind. It struck and slowly separated, then with a majestic motion flowed like water over the edge of the precipice on either side, and fell with a thudding sound into the unmeasured depths beneath. And this was but a little thing, a mere forerunner, for after it, with a slow, serpentine movement, rolled the body of the avalanche.\n\nIt came in combers, it came in level floods. It piled itself against our hill, yes, to within fifty feet of the head of it, till we thought that even that rooted rock must be torn from its foundations and hurled like a pebble to the deeps beneath. And the turmoil of it all! The screaming of the blast caused by the compression of the air, the dull, continuous thudding of the fall of millions of tons of snow as they rushed through space and ended their journey in the gulf.\n\nNor was this the worst of it, for as the deep snows above thinned, great boulders that had been buried beneath them, perhaps for centuries, were loosened from their resting-places and began to thunder down the hill. At first they moved slowly, throwing up the hard snow around them as the prow of a ship throws foam. Then gathering momentum, they sprang into the air with leaps such as those of shells ricocheting upon water, till in the end, singing and hurtling, many of them rushed past and even over us to vanish far beyond. Some indeed struck our little mountain with the force of shot fired from the great guns of a battle-ship, and shattered there, or if they fell upon its side, tore away tons of rock and passed with them into the chasm like a meteor surrounded by its satellites. Indeed, no bombardment devised and directed by man could have been half so terrible or, had there been anything to destroy, half so destructive.\n\nThe scene was appalling in its unchained and resistless might evolved suddenly from the completest calm. There in the lap of the quiet mountains, looked down upon by the peaceful, tender sky, the powers hidden in the breast of Nature were suddenly set free, and, companioned by whirlwinds and all the terrifying majesty of sound, loosed upon the heads of us two human atoms.\n\nAt the first rush of snow we had leapt back behind our protecting peak and, lying at full length upon the ground, gripped it and clung there, fearing lest the wind should whirl us to the abyss. Long ago our tent had gone like a dead leaf in an autumn gale, and at times it seemed as if we must follow.\n\nThe boulders hurtled over and past us; one of them fell full upon the little peak, shattering its crest and bursting into fragments, which fled away, each singing its own wild song. We were not touched, but when we looked behind us it was to see the yak, which had risen in its terror, lying dead and headless. Then in our fear we lay still, waiting for the end, and wondering dimly whether we should be buried in the surging snow or swept away with the hill, or crushed by the flying rocks, or lifted and lost in the hurricane.\n\nHow long did it last? We never knew. It may have been ten minutes or two hours, for in such a scene time loses its proportion. Only we became aware that the wind had fallen, while the noise of grinding snow and hurtling boulders ceased. Very cautiously we gained our feet and looked.\n\nIn front of us was sheer mountain side, for a depth of over two miles, the width of about a thousand yards, which had been covered with many feet of snow, was now bare rock. Piled up against the face of our hill, almost to its summit, lay a tongue of snow, pressed to the consistency of ice and spotted with boulders that had lodged there. The peak itself was torn and shattered, so that it revealed great gleaming surfaces and pits, in which glittered mica, or some other mineral. The vast gulf behind was half filled with the avalanche and its debris. But for the rest, it seemed as though nothing had happened, for the sun shone sweetly overhead and the solemn snows reflected its rays from the sides of a hundred hills. And we had endured it all and were still alive; yes, and unhurt.",
    "Oh! what cold was that. The frost was fearful, and at this height a wind blew whose icy breath passed through all our wrappings, and seemed to burn our flesh beneath as though with hot irons. It was fortunate that we had brought the yak, for without the warmth from its shaggy body I believe that we should have perished, even in our tent. For some hours we watched, as indeed we must, since to sleep might mean to die, yet saw nothing save the lonely stars, and heard nothing in that awful silence, for here even the wind made no noise as it slid across the snows. Accustomed as I was to such exposure, my faculties began to grow numb and my eyes to shut, when suddenly Leo said--\u201cLook, below the red star!\u201d\n\nI looked, and there high in the sky was the same curious glow which we had seen upon the previous night. There was more than this indeed, for beneath it, almost on a line with us and just above the crests of the intervening peaks, appeared a faint sheet of fire and revealed against it, something black. Whilst we watched, the fire widened, spread upwards and grew in power and intensity. Now against its flaming background the black object became clearly visible, and lo! it was the top of a soaring pillar surmounted by a loop. Yes, we could see its every outline. It was the _crux ansata_, the Symbol of Life itself.\n\nThe symbol vanished, the fire sank. Again it blazed up more fiercely than before and the loop appeared afresh, then once more disappeared. A third time the fire shone, and with such intensity, that no lightning could surpass its brilliance. All around the heavens were lit up, and, through the black needle-shaped eye of the symbol, as from the flare of a beacon, or the search-light of a ship, one fierce ray shot across the sea of mountain tops and the spaces of the desert, straight as an arrow to the lofty peak on which we lay. Yes, it lit upon the snow, staining it red, and upon the wild, white faces of us who watched, though to the right and left of us spread thick darkness. My compass lay before me on the snow, and I could even see its needle; and beyond us the shape of a white fox that had crept near, scenting food. Then it was gone as swiftly as it came. Gone too were the symbol and the veil of flame behind it, only the glow lingered a little on the distant sky.\n\nFor awhile there was silence between us, then Leo said--\u201cDo you remember, Horace, when we lay upon the Rocking Stone where _her_ cloak fell upon me--\u201d as he said the words the breath caught in his throat--\u201chow the ray of light was sent to us in farewell, and to show us a path of escape from the Place of Death? Now I think that it has been sent again in greeting to point out the path to the Place of Life where Ayesha dwells, whom we have lost awhile.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be so,\u201d I answered shortly, for the matter was beyond speech or argument, beyond wonder even. But I knew then, as I know now that we were players in some mighty, predestined drama; that our parts were written and we must speak them, as our path was prepared and we must tread it to the end unknown. Fear and doubt were left behind, hope was sunk in certainty; the fore-shadowing visions of the night had found an actual fulfilment and the pitiful seed of the promise of her who died, growing unseen through all the cruel, empty years, had come to harvest.\n\nNo, we feared no more, not even when with the dawn rose the roaring wind, through which we struggled down the mountain slopes, as it would seem in peril of our lives at every step; not even as hour by hour we fought our way onwards through the whirling snow-storm, that made us deaf and blind. For we knew that those lives were charmed. We could not see or hear, yet we were led. Clinging to the yak, we struggled downward and homewards, till at length out of the turmoil and the gloom its instinct brought us unharmed to the door of the monastery, where the old abbot embraced us in his joy, and the monks put up prayers of thanks. For they were sure that we must be dead. Through such a storm, they said, no man had ever lived before.",
    "Now, when I was carried from the rock-chamber where Leo and I had been together, I took note of the way. First, reckoning from my sleeping-place, there was a passage thirty paces long, for I had counted the footfalls of my bearers. Then came a turn to the left, and ten more paces of passage, and lastly near certain steps running to some place unknown, another sharp turn to the right which led to our old chamber.\n\nDown the long passage I walked stealthily, and although it was pitch dark, found the turn to the left, and followed it till I came to the second sharp turn to the right, that of the gallery from which rose the stairs. I crept round it only to retreat hastily enough, as well I might, for at the door of Leo\u2019s room, which she was in the act of locking on the outside, as I could see by the light of the lamp that she held in her hand, stood the Khania herself.\n\nMy first thought was to fly back to my own chamber, but I abandoned it, feeling sure that I should be seen. Therefore I determined, if she discovered me, to face the matter out and say that I was trying to find Leo, and to learn how he fared. So I crouched against the wall, and waited with a beating heart. I heard her sweep down the passage, and--yes--begin to mount the stair.\n\nNow, what should I do? To try to reach Leo was useless, for she had locked the door with the key she held. Go back to bed? No, I would follow her, and if we met would make the same excuse. Thus I might get some tidings, or perhaps--a dagger thrust.\n\nSo round the corner and up the steps I went, noiselessly as a snake. They were many and winding, like those of a church tower, but at length I came to the head of them, where was a little landing, and opening from it a door. It was a very ancient door; the light streamed through cracks where its panels had rotted, and from the room beyond came the sound of voices, those of the Shaman Simbri and the Khania.\n\n\u201cHave you learned aught, my niece?\u201d I heard him say, and also heard her answer---\u201cA little. A very little.\u201d\n\nThen in my thirst for knowledge I grew bold, and stealing to the door, looked through one of the cracks in its wood. Opposite to me, in the full flood of light thrown by a hanging lamp, her hand resting on a table at which Simbri was seated, stood the Khania. Truly she was a beauteous sight, for she wore robes of royal purple, and on her brow a little coronet of gold, beneath which her curling hair streamed down her shapely neck and bosom. Seeing her I guessed at once that she had arrayed herself thus for some secret end, enhancing her loveliness by every art and grace that is known to woman. Simbri was looking at her earnestly, with fear and doubt written on even his cold, impassive features.\n\n\u201cWhat passed between you, then?\u201d he asked, peering at her.\n\n\u201cI questioned him closely as to the reason of his coming to this land, and wrung from him the answer that it was to seek some beauteous woman--he would say no more. I asked him if she were more beauteous than _I_ am, and he replied with courtesy--nothing else, I think--that it would be hard to say, but that she had been different. Then I said that though it behooved me not to speak of such a matter, there was no lady in Kaloon whom men held to be so fair as I; moreover, that I was its ruler, and that I and no other had saved him from the water. Aye, and I added that my heart told me I was the woman whom he sought.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave done, niece,\u201d said Simbri impatiently, \u201cI would not hear of the arts you used--well enough, doubtless. What then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he said that it might be so, since he thought that this woman was born again, and studied me a while, asking me if I had ever \u2018passed through fire.\u2019 To this I replied that the only fires I had passed were those of the spirit, and that I dwelt in them now. He said, \u2018Show me your hair,\u2019 and I placed a lock of it in his hand. Presently he let it fall, and from that satchel which he wears about his neck drew out another tress of hair--oh! Simbri, my uncle, the loveliest hair that ever eyes beheld, for it was soft as silk, and reached from my coronet to the ground. Moreover, no raven\u2019s wing in the sunshine ever shone as did that fragrant tress.\n\n\u201c\u2018Yours is beautiful,\u2019 he said, \u2018but see, they are not the same.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Mayhap,\u2019 I answered, \u2018since no woman ever wore such locks.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018You are right,\u2019 he replied, \u2018for she whom I seek was more than a woman.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then--and then--though I tried him in many ways he would say no more, so, feeling hate against this Unknown rising in my heart, and fearing lest I should utter words that were best unsaid, I left him. Now I bid you, search the books which are open to your wisdom and tell me of this woman whom he seeks, who she is, and where she dwells. Oh! search them swiftly, that I may find her and--kill her if I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, if you can,\u201d answered the Shaman, \u201cand if she lives to kill. But say, where shall we begin our quest? Now, this letter from the Mountain that the head-priest Oros sent to your court a while ago?\u201d--and he selected a parchment from a pile which lay upon the table and looked at her.\n\n\u201cRead,\u201d she said, \u201cI would hear it again.\u201d\n\nSo he read: \u201cFrom the Hesea of the House of Fire, to Atene, Khania of Kaloon.\n\nMy sister--Warning has reached me that two strangers of a western race journey to your land, seeking my Oracle, of which they would ask a question. On the first day of the next moon, I command that you and with you Simbri, your great-uncle, the wise Shaman, Guardian of the Gate, shall be watching the river in the gulf at the foot of the ancient road, for by that steep path the strangers travel. Aid them in all things and bring them safely to the Mountain, knowing that in this matter I shall hold him and you to account. Myself I will not meet them, since to do so would be to break the pact between our powers, which says that the Hesea of the Sanctuary visits not the territory of Kaloon, save in war. Also their coming is otherwise appointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would seem,\u201d said Simbri, laying down the parchment, \u201cthat these are no chance wanderers, since Hes awaits them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, they are no chance wanderers, since my heart awaited one of them also. Yet the Hesea cannot be that woman, for reasons which are known to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are many women on the Mountain,\u201d suggested the Shaman in a dry voice, \u201cif indeed any woman has to do with this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI at least have to do with it, and he shall not go to the Mountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHes is powerful, my niece, and beneath these smooth words of hers lies a dreadful threat. I say that she is mighty from of old and has servants in the earth and air who warned her of the coming of these men, and will warn her of what befalls them. I know it, who hate her, and to your royal house of Rassen it has been known for many a generation. Therefore thwart her not lest ill befall us all, for she is a spirit and terrible. She says that it is appointed that they shall go----\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd _I_ say it is appointed that he shall not go. Let the other go if he desires.\u201d\n\n\u201cAtene, be plain, what will you with the man called Leo--that he should become your lover?\u201d asked the Shaman.\n\nShe stared him straight in the eyes, and answered boldly--\u201cNay, I will that he should become my husband.\u201d",
    "We sprang to our saddles, but before we gave rein I turned and looked behind me. It will be remembered that we had ridden up a long slope which terminated in a ridge, about three miles away, the border of the great plain whereon we stood. Now the sun had sunk behind that ridge so that although it was still light the plain had fallen into shadow. Therefore, while no distant object could be seen upon the plain, anything crossing the ridge remained visible enough in that clear air, at least to persons of keen sight.\n\nThis is what we saw. Over the ridge poured a multitude of little objects, and amongst the last of these galloped a man mounted on a great horse, who led another horse by the bridle.\n\n\u201cAll the pack are out,\u201d said Leo grimly, \u201cand Rassen has brought a second mount with him. Now I see why he wanted us to leave the spears, and I think,\u201d he shouted as we began to gallop, \u201cthat before all is done the Shaman may prove himself a true prophet.\u201d\n\nAway we sped through the gathering darkness, heading straight for the Peak. While we went I calculated our chances. Our horses, as good as any in the land, were still strong and fresh, for although we had ridden far we had not over-pressed them, and their condition was excellent. But doubtless the death-hounds were fresh also, for, meaning to run us down at night when he thought that he might catch us sleeping, Rassen would have brought them along easily, following us by inquiry among the peasants and only laying them on our spoor after the last village had been left behind.\n\nAlso he had two mounts, and for aught we knew--though afterwards this proved not to be the case, for he wished to work his wickedness alone and unseen--he might be followed by attendants with relays. Therefore it would appear that unless we reached some place whither he did not dare to follow, before him--that is the slopes of the Peak many miles away, he must run us down. There remained the chance also that the dogs would tire and refuse to pursue the chase.\n\nThis, however, seemed scarcely probable, for they were extraordinarily swift and strong, and so savage that when once they had scented blood, in which doubtless our horses\u2019 hoofs were steeped, they would fall dead from exhaustion sooner than abandon the trail. Indeed, both the Khania and Simbri had often told us as much. Another chance--they might lose the scent, but seeing its nature, again this was not probable. Even an English pack will carry the trail of a red herring breast high without a fault for hours, and here was something stronger--a cunning compound of which the tell-tale odour would hold for days. A last chance. If we were forced to abandon our horses, we, their riders, might possibly escape, could we find any place to hide in on that great plain. If not, we should be seen as well as scented, and then----No, the odds were all against us, but so they had often been before; meanwhile we had three miles start, and perhaps help would come to us from the Mountain, some help unforeseen. So we set our teeth and sped away like arrows while the light lasted.\n\nVery soon it failed, and whilst the moon was hidden behind the mountains the night grew dark.  Now the hounds gained on us, for in the gloom, which to them was nothing, we did not dare to ride full speed, fearing lest our horses should stumble and lame themselves, or fall. Then it was for the second time since we had dwelt in this land of Kaloon that of a sudden the fire flamed upon the Peak. When we had seen it before, it had appeared to flash across the heavens in one great lighthouse ray, concentrated through the loop above the pillar, and there this night also the ray ran far above us like a lance of fire. But now that we were nearer to its fount we found ourselves bathed in a soft, mysterious radiance like that of the phosphorescence on a summer sea, reflected downwards perhaps from the clouds and massy rock roof of the column loop and diffused by the snows beneath.\n\nThis unearthly glimmer, faint as it was, helped us much, indeed but for it we must have been overtaken, for here the ground was very rough, full of holes also made by burrowing marmots. Thus in our extremity help did come to us from the Mountain, until at length the moon rose, when as quickly as they had appeared the volcanic fires vanished, leaving behind them nothing but the accustomed pillar of dull red smoke.\n\nIt is a commonplace to speak of the music of hounds at chase, but often I have wondered how that music sounds in the ears of the deer or the fox fleeing for its life. Now, when we filled the place of the quarry, it was my destiny to solve this problem, and I assert with confidence that the progeny of earth can produce no more hideous noise. It had come near to us, and in the desolate silence of the night the hellish harmonies of its volume seemed terrific, yet I could discern the separate notes of which it was composed, especially one deep, bell-like bay. I remembered that I had heard this bay when we sat in the boat upon the river and saw that poor noble done to death for the crime of loving the Khania. As the hunt passed us then I observed that it burst from the throat of the leading hound, a huge brute, red in colour, with a coal-black ear, fangs that gleamed like ivory, and a mouth which resembled a hot oven. I even knew the name of the beast, for afterwards the Khan, whose peculiar joy it was, had pointed it out to me. He called it Master, because no dog in the pack dared fight it, and told me that it could kill an armed man alone.  Now, as its baying warned us, Master was not half a mile away!\n\nThe coming of the moonlight enabled us to gallop faster, especially as here the ground was smooth, being covered with a short, dry turf, and for the next two hours we gained upon the pack. Yes, it was only two hours, or perhaps less, but it seemed a score of centuries. The slopes of the Peak were now not more than ten miles ahead, but our horses were giving out at last. They had borne us nobly, poor beasts, though we were no light weights, yet their strength had its limits. The sweat ran from them, their sides panted like bellows, they breathed in gasps, they stumbled and would scarcely answer to the flogging of our spear-shafts. Their gallop sank to a jolting canter, and I thought that soon they must come to a dead stop.",
    "\u201cListen, you people,\u201d said the priest, \u201cand learn that this man deserved his dreadful doom. Know you why he purposed to kill that woman whom the strangers saved? Because his familiar marked her as a witch, you think. I tell you it was not so. It was because she being fair, he would have taken her from her husband, as he had taken many another, and she refused him. But the Eye saw, the Voice spoke, and the Messenger did judgment. He is caught in his own snare, and so shall you be, every one of you who dares to think evil in his heart or to do it with his hands. Such is the just decree of the Hesea, spoken by her from her throne amidst the fires of the Mountain.\u201d\n\nOne by one the terrified tribesmen crept away. When the last of them were gone the priest advanced to Leo and saluted him by placing his hand upon his forehead.\n\n\u201cLord,\u201d he said, in the same corrupt Grecian dialect which was used by the courtiers of Kaloon, \u201cI will not ask if you are hurt, since from the moment that you entered the sacred river and set foot within this land you and your companion were protected by a power invisible and could not be harmed by man or spirit, however great may have seemed your danger. Yet vile hands have been laid upon you, and this is the command of the Mother whom I serve, that, if you desire it, every one of those men who touched you shall die before your eyes. Say, is that your will?\u201d\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d answered Leo; \u201cthey were mad and blind, let no blood be shed for _us_. All we ask of you, friend--but, how are you called?\u201d\n\n\u201cName me Oros,\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cFriend Oros--a good title for one who dwells upon the Mountain--all we ask is food and shelter, and to be led swiftly into the presence of her whom you name Mother, that Oracle whose wisdom we have travelled far to seek.\u201d\n\nHe bowed and answered: \u201cThe food and shelter are prepared and to-morrow, when you have rested, I am commanded to conduct you whither you desire to be. Follow me, I pray you\u201d; and he preceded us past the fiery pit to a building that stood about fifty yards away against the rock wall of the amphitheatre.\n\nIt would seem that it was a guest-house, or at least had been made ready to serve that purpose, as in it lamps were lit and a fire burned, for here the air was cold. The house was divided into two rooms, the second of them a sleeping place, to which he led us through the first.\n\n\u201cEnter,\u201d he said, \u201cfor you will need to cleanse yourselves, and you\u201d--here he addressed himself to me--\u201cto be treated for that hurt to your arm which you had from the jaws of the great hound.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow know you that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt matters not if I do know and have made ready,\u201d Oros answered gravely.\n\nThis second room was lighted and warmed like the first, moreover, heated water stood in basins of metal and on the beds were laid clean linen garments and dark-coloured hooded robes, lined with rich fur. Also upon a little table were ointments, bandages, and splints, a marvellous thing to see, for it told me that the very nature of my hurt had been divined. But I asked no more questions; I was too weary; moreover, I knew that it would be useless.\n\nNow the priest Oros helped me to remove my tattered robe, and, undoing the rough bandages upon my arm, washed it gently with warm water, in which he mixed some spirit, and examined it with the skill of a trained doctor.\n\n\u201cThe fangs rent deep,\u201d he said, \u201cand the small bone is broken, but you will take no harm, save for the scars which must remain.\u201d Then, having treated the wounds with ointment, he wrapped the limb with such a delicate touch that it scarcely pained me, saying that by the morrow the swelling would have gone down and he would set the bone. This indeed happened.\n\nAfter it was done he helped me to wash and to clothe myself in the clean garments, and put a sling about my neck to serve as a rest for my arm. Meanwhile Leo had also dressed himself, so that we left the chamber together very different men to the foul, blood-stained wanderers who had entered there. In the outer room we found food prepared for us, of which we ate with a thankful heart and without speaking. Then, blind with weariness, we returned to the other chamber and, having removed our outer garments, flung ourselves upon the beds and were soon plunged in sleep.\n\nAt some time in the night I awoke suddenly, at what hour I do not know, as certain people wake, I among them, when their room is entered, even without the slightest noise. Before I opened my eyes I felt that some one was with us in the place. Nor was I mistaken. A little lamp still burned in the chamber, a mere wick floating in oil, and by its light I saw a dim, ghost-like form standing near the door. Indeed I thought almost that it was a ghost, till presently I remembered, and knew it for our corpse-like guide, who appeared to be looking intently at the bed on which Leo lay, or so I thought, for the head was bent in that direction.\n\nAt first she was quite still, then she moaned aloud, a low and terrible moan, which seemed to well from the very heart.  So the thing was not dumb, as I had believed. Evidently it could suffer, and express its suffering in a human fashion. Look! it was wringing its padded hands as in an excess of woe. Now it would seem that Leo began to feel its influence also, for he stirred and spoke in his sleep, so low at first that I could only distinguish the tongue he used, which was Arabic. Presently I caught a few words.\n\n\u201cAyesha,\u201d he said, \u201c_Ayesha!_\u201d\n\nThe figure glided towards him and stopped. He sat up in the bed still fast asleep, for his eyes were shut. He stretched out his arms, as though seeking one whom he would embrace, and spoke again in a low and passionate voice--\u201cAyesha, through life and death I have sought thee long. Come to me, my goddess, my desired.\u201d\n\nThe figure glided yet nearer, and I could see that it was trembling, and now its arms were extended also.  At the bedside she halted, and Leo laid himself down again. Now the coverings had fallen back, exposing his breast, where lay the leather satchel he always wore, that which contained the lock of Ayesha\u2019s hair. He was fast asleep, and the figure seemed to fix its eyes upon this satchel. Presently it did more, for, with surprising deftness those white-wrapped fingers opened its clasp, yes, and drew out the long tress of shining hair. Long and earnestly she gazed at it, then gently replaced the relic, closed the satchel and for a little while seemed to weep. While she stood thus the dreaming Leo once more stretched out his arms and spoke, saying, in the same passion-laden voice--\u201cCome to me, my darling, my beautiful, my beautiful!\u201d\n\nAt those words, with a little muffled scream, like that of a scared night-bird, the figure turned and flitted through the doorway.",
    "As we went down the ravine by which we had approached the village on the previous night, a sound of chanting struck our ears. Presently the path turned, and we saw a solemn procession advancing up that dismal, sunless gorge. At the head of it rode none other than the beautiful Khania, followed by her great-uncle, the old Shaman, and after these came a company of shaven priests in their white robes, bearing between them a bier, upon which, its face uncovered, lay the body of the Khan, draped in a black garment. Yet he looked better thus than he had ever done, for now death had touched this insane and dissolute man with something of the dignity which he lacked in life. Thus then we met. At the sight of our guide\u2019s white form, the horse which the Khania rode reared up so violently that I thought it would have thrown her. But she mastered the animal with her whip and voice, and called out--\u201cWho is this draped hag of the Mountain that stops the path of the Khania Atene and her dead lord? My guests, I find you in ill company, for it seems that you are conducted by an evil spirit to meet an evil fate. That guide of yours must surely be something hateful and hideous, for were she a wholesome woman she would not fear to show her face.\u201d\n\nNow the Shaman plucked his mistress by the sleeve, and the priest Oros, bowing to her, prayed her to be silent and cease to speak such ill-omened words into the air, which might carry them she knew not whither. But some instinctive hate seemed to bubble up in Atene, and she would not be silent, for she addressed our guide using the direct \u201cthou,\u201d a manner of speech that we found was very usual on the Mountain though rare upon the Plains. \u201cLet the air carry them whither it will,\u201d she cried. \u201cSorceress, strip off thy rags, fit only for a corpse too vile to view. Show us what thou art, thou flitting night-owl, who thinkest to frighten me with that livery of death, which only serves to hide the death within.\u201d\n\n\u201cCease, I pray lady, cease,\u201d said Oros, stirred for once out of his imperturbable calm. \u201cShe is the Minister, none other, and with her goes the Power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it goes not against Atene, Khania of Kaloon,\u201d she answered, \u201cor so I think. Power, forsooth! Let her show her power. If she has any it is not her own, but that of the Witch of the Mountain, who feigns to be a spirit, and by her sorceries has drawn away my guests\u201d--and she pointed to us--\u201cthus bringing my husband to his death.\u201d\n\n\u201cNiece, be silent!\u201d said the old Shaman, whose wrinkled face was white with terror, whilst Oros held up his hands as though in supplication to some unseen Strength, saying--\u201cO thou that hearest and seest, be merciful, I beseech thee, and forgive this woman her madness, lest the blood of a guest should stain the hands of thy servants, and the ancient honour of our worship be brought low in the eyes of men.\u201d\n\nThus he prayed, but although his hands were uplifted, it seemed to me that his eyes were fixed upon our guide, as ours were. While he spoke, I saw her hand raised, as she had raised it when she slew or rather sentenced the witch-doctor. Then she seemed to reflect, and stayed it in mid air, so that it pointed at the Khania. She did not move, she made no sound, only she pointed, and the angry words died upon Atene\u2019s lips, the fury left her eyes, and the colour her face. Yes, she grew white and silent as the corpse upon the bier behind her. Then, cowed by that invisible power, she struck her horse so fiercely that it bounded by us onward towards the village, at which the funeral company were to rest awhile.\n\nAs the Shaman Simbri followed the Khania, the priest Oros caught his horse\u2019s bridle and said to him--\u201cMagician, we have met before, for instance, when your lady\u2019s father was brought to his funeral. Warn her, then, you that know something of the truth and of her power to speak more gently of the ruler of this land. Say to her, from me, that had she not been the ambassadress of death, and, therefore, inviolate, surely ere now she would have shared her husband\u2019s bier. Farewell, tomorrow we will speak again,\u201d and, loosing the Shaman\u2019s bridle, Oros passed on.\n\nSoon we had left the melancholy procession behind us and, issuing from the gorge, turned up the Mountain slope towards the edge of the bright snows that lay not far above. It was as we came out of this darksome valley, where the overhanging pine trees almost eclipsed the light, that suddenly we missed our guide.\n\n\u201cHas she gone back to--to reason with the Khania?\u201d I asked of Oros.\n\n\u201cNay!\u201d he answered, with a slight smile, \u201cI think that she has gone forward to give warning that the Hesea\u2019s guests draw near.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d I answered, staring hard at the bare slope of mountain, up which not a mouse could have passed without being seen. \u201cI understand--she has gone forward,\u201d and the matter dropped. But what I did _not_ understand was--how she had gone. As the Mountain was honeycombed with caves and galleries, I suppose, however, that she entered one of them.",
    "Behold! a temple set amid sands and washed by a wide, palm-bordered river, and across its pyloned court processions of priests, who pass to and fro with flaunting banners. The court empties; I could see the shadow of a falcon\u2019s wings that fled across its sunlit floor. A man clad in a priest\u2019s white robe, shaven-headed, and barefooted, enters through the southern pylon gate and walks slowly towards a painted granite shrine, in which sits the image of a woman crowned with the double crown of Egypt, surmounted by a lotus bloom, and holding in her hand the sacred sistrum. Now, as though he heard some sound, he halts and looks towards us, and by the heaven above me, his face is the face of Leo Vincey in his youth, the face too of that Kallikrates whose corpse we had seen in the Caves of K\u00f4r!\n\n\u201cLook, look!\u201d gasped Leo, catching me by the arm; but I only nodded my head in answer.\n\nThe man walks on again, and kneeling before the goddess in the shrine, embraces her feet and makes his prayer to her. Now the gates roll open, and a procession enters, headed by a veiled, noble-looking woman, who bears offerings, which she sets on the table before the shrine, bending her knee to the effigy of the goddess. Her oblations made, she turns to depart, and as she goes brushes her hand against the hand of the watching priest, who hesitates, then follows her.\n\nWhen all her company have passed the gate she lingers alone in the shadow of the pylon, whispering to the priest and pointing to the river and the southern land beyond. He is disturbed; he reasons with her, till, after one swift glance round, she lets drop her veil, bending towards him and--their lips meet.\n\nAs time flies her face is turned towards us, and lo! it is the face of Atene, and amid her dusky hair the aura is reflected in jewelled gold, the symbol of her royal rank. She looks at the shaven priest; she laughs as though in triumph; she points to the westering sun and to the river, and is gone.\n\nAye, and that laugh of long ago is echoed by Atene at our side, for she also laughs in triumph and cries aloud to the old Shaman--\u201cTrue diviners were my heart and thou! Behold how I won him in the past.\u201d\n\nThen, like ice on fire fell the cold voice of the Hesea. \u201cBe silent, woman, and see how thou didst lose him in the past.\u201d\n\nLo! the scene changes, and on a couch a lovely shape lies sleeping. She dreams; she is afraid; and over her bends and whispers in her ear a shadowy form clad with the emblems of the goddess in the shrine, but now wearing upon her head the vulture cap. The woman wakes from her dream and looks round, and oh! the face is the face of Ayesha as it was seen of us when first she loosed her veil in the Caves of K\u00f4r.\n\nA sigh went up from us; we could not speak who thus fearfully once more beheld her loveliness.\n\nAgain she sleeps, again the awful form bends over her and whispers. It points, the distance opens. Lo! on a stormy sea a boat, and in the boat two wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, the priest and the royal woman, while over them like a Vengeance, raw-necked and ragged-pinioned, hovers a following vulture, such a vulture as the goddess wore for headdress.\n\nThat picture fades from its burning frame, leaving the vast sheet of fire empty as the noonday sky. Then another forms. First a great, smooth-walled cave carpeted with sand, a cave that we remembered well. Then lying on the sand, now no longer shaven, but golden-haired, the corpse of the priest staring upwards with his glazed eyes, his white skin streaked with blood, and standing over him two women. One holds a javelin in her hand and is naked except for her flowing hair, and beautiful, beautiful beyond imagining. The other, wrapped in a dark cloak, beats the air with her hands, casting up her eyes as though to call the curse of Heaven upon her rival\u2019s head. And those women are she into whose sleeping ear the shadow had whispered, and the royal Egyptian who had kissed her lover beneath the pylon gate.\n\nSlowly all the figures faded; it was as though the fire ate them up, for first they became thin and white as ashes; then vanished. The Hesea, who had been leaning forward, sank backwards in her chair, as if weary with the toil of her own magic.\n\nFor a while confused pictures flitted rapidly to and fro across the vast mirror of the flame, such as might be reflected from an intelligence crowded with the memories of over two thousand years which it was too exhausted to separate and define. Wild scenes, multitudes of people, great caves, and in them faces, amongst others our own, starting up distorted and enormous, to grow tiny in an instant and depart; stark imaginations of Forms towering and divine; of Things monstrous and inhuman; armies marching, illimitable battle-fields, and corpses rolled in blood, and hovering over them the spirits of the slain.\n\nThese pictures died as the others had died, and the fire was blank again.",
    "Then she was silent, nor would she speak more upon the matter. Also--and this was the worst of it--even now I was not sure that she told me the truth, or, at any rate, all of it, for to Ayesha\u2019s mind truth seemed many coloured as are the rays of light thrown from the different faces of a cut jewel. We never could be certain which shade of it she was pleased to present, who, whether by preference or of necessity, as she herself had said, spoke of such secrets in figures of speech and parables.\n\nIt is a fact that to this hour I do not know whether Ayesha is spirit or woman, or, as I suspect, a blend of both. I do not know the limits of her powers, or if that elaborate story of the beginning of her love for Leo was true--which personally I doubt--or but a fable, invented by her mind, and through it, as she had hinted, pictured on the flame for her own hidden purposes.\n\nI do not know whether when first we saw her on the Mountain she was really old and hideous, or did but put on that shape in our eyes in order to test her lover. I do not know whether, as the priest Oros bore witness--which he may well have been bidden to do--her spirit passed into the body of the dead priestess of Hes, or whether when she seemed to perish there so miserably, her body and her soul were wafted straightway from the Caves of K\u00f4r to this Central Asian peak.\n\nI do not know why, as she was so powerful, she did not come to seek us, instead of leaving us to seek her through so many weary years, though I suggest that some superior force forbade her to do more than companion us unseen, watching our every act, reading our every thought, until at length we reached the predestined place and hour. Also, as will appear, there were other things of which this is not the time to speak, whereby I am still more tortured and perplexed.\n\nIn short, I know nothing, except that my existence has been intertangled with one of the great mysteries of the world; that the glorious being called Ayesha won the secret of life from whatever power holds it in its keeping; that she alleged--although of this, remember, we have no actual proof--such life was to be attained by bathing in a certain emanation, vapour or essence; that she was possessed by a passion not easy to understand, but terrific in its force and immortal in its nature, concentrated upon one other being and one alone. That through this passion also some angry fate smote her again, again, and yet again, making of her countless days a burden, and leading the power and the wisdom which knew all but could foreknow nothing, into abysses of anguish, suspense, and disappointment such as--Heaven be thanked!--we common men and women are not called upon to plumb.\n\nFor the rest, should human eyes ever fall upon it, each reader must form his own opinion of this history, its true interpretation and significance. These and the exact parts played by Atene and myself in its development I hope to solve shortly, though not here.\n\nWell, as I have said, the upshot of it all was that Ayesha was devoured with anxiety about Leo. Except in this matter of marriage, his every wish was satisfied, and indeed forestalled. Thus he was never again asked to share in any of the ceremonies of the Sanctuary, though, indeed, stripped of its rites and spiritual symbols, the religion of the College of Hes proved pure and harmless enough. It was but a diluted version of the Osiris and Isis worship of old Egypt, from which it had been inherited, mixed with the Central Asian belief in the transmigration or reincarnation of souls and the possibility of drawing near to the ultimate Godhead by holiness of thought and life.\n\nIn fact, the head priestess and Oracle was only worshipped as a representative of the Divinity, while the temporal aims of the College in practice were confined to good works, although it is true that they still sighed for their lost authority over the country of Kaloon. Thus they had hospitals, and during the long and severe winters, when the Tribes of the Mountain slopes were often driven to the verge of starvation, gave liberally to the destitute from their stores of food.\n\nLeo liked to be with Ayesha continually, so we spent each evening in her company, and much of the day also, until she found that this inactivity told upon him who for years had been accustomed to endure every rigour of climate in the open air. After this came home to her--although she was always haunted by terror lest any accident should befall him--Ayesha insisted upon his going out to kill the wild sheep and the ibex, which lived in numbers on the mountain ridges, placing him in the charge of the chiefs and huntsmen of the Tribes, with whom thus he became well acquainted. In this exercise, however, I accompanied him but rarely, as, if used too much, my arm still gave me pain.",
    "Ayesha, in her sweetest voice, was questioning the men as to how the leopard, of which the skin lay before her, had come to attack Leo. The chief answered that they had tracked the brute to its lair between two rocks; that one of them had gone in and wounded it, whereon it sprang upon him and struck him down; that then the lord Leo had engaged it while the man escaped, and was also struck down, after which, rolling with it on the ground, he stabbed and slew the animal. That was all.\n\n\u201cNo, not all,\u201d said Ayesha; \u201cfor you forget, cowards that you are, that, keeping yourselves in safety, you left my lord to the fury of this beast. Good. Drive them out on to the Mountain, there to perish also at the fangs of beasts, and make it known that he who gives them food or shelter dies.\u201d\n\nOffering no prayer for pity or excuse, the chief and his followers rose, bowed, and turned to go.\n\n\u201cStay a moment, comrades,\u201d said Leo, \u201cand, chief, give me your arm; my scratch grows stiff; I cannot walk fast. We will finish this hunt together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat doest thou? Art mad?\u201d asked Ayesha.\n\n\u201cI know not whether I am mad,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut I know that thou art wicked and unjust. Look now, than these hunters none braver ever breathed. That man\u201d--and he pointed to the one whom the leopard had struck down--\u201ctook my place and went in before me because I ordered that we should attack the creature, and thus was felled. As thou seest all, thou mightest have seen this also. Then it sprang on me, and the rest of these, my friends, ran round waiting a chance to strike, which at first they could not do unless they would have killed me with it, since I and the brute rolled over and over in the snow. As it was, one of them seized it with his bare hands: look at the teeth marks on his arm. So if they are to perish on the Mountain, I, who am the man to blame, perish with them.\u201d\n\nNow, while the hunters looked at him with fervent gratitude in their eyes, Ayesha thought a little, then said cleverly enough--\u201cIn truth, my lord Leo, had I known all the tale, well mightest thou have named me wicked and unjust; but I knew only what I saw, and out of their own mouths did I condemn them. My servants, my lord here has pleaded for you, and you are forgiven; more, he who rushed in upon the leopard and he who seized it with his hands shall be rewarded and advanced. Go; but I warn you if you suffer my lord to come into more danger, you shall not escape so easily again.\u201d\n\nSo they bowed and went, still blessing Leo with their eyes, since death by exposure on the Mountain snows was the most terrible form of punishment known to these people, and one only inflicted by the direct order of Hes upon murderers or other great criminals.\n\nWhen we had left the Sanctuary and were alone again in the hall, the storm that I had seen gathering upon Leo\u2019s face broke in earnest. Ayesha renewed her inquiries about his wounds, and wished to call Oros, the physician, to dress them, and as he refused this, offered to do so herself. He begged that she would leave his wounds alone, and then, his great beard bristling with wrath, asked her solmenly if he was a child in arms, a query so absurd that I could not help laughing.\n\nThen he scolded her--yes, he scolded Ayesha! Wishing to know what she meant (1) by spying upon him with her magic, an evil gift that he had always disliked and mistrusted; (2) by condemning brave and excellent men, his good friends, to a death of fiendish cruelty upon such evidence, or rather out of temper, on no evidence at all; and (3) by giving him into charge of them, as though he were a little boy, and telling them that they would have to answer for it if he were hurt: he who, in his time, had killed every sort of big game known and passed through some perils and encounters?\n\nThus he beat her with his words, and, wonderful to say, Ayesha, this being more than woman, submitted to the chastisement meekly. Yet had any other man dared to address her with roughness even, I doubt not that his speech and his life would have come to a swift and simultaneous end, for I knew that now, as of old, she could slay by the mere effort of her will. But she did not slay; she did not even threaten, only, as any other loving woman might have done, she began to cry. Yes, great tears gathered in those lovely eyes of hers and, rolling one by one down her face, fell--for her head was bent humbly forward--like heavy raindrops on the marble floor.\n\n\nAt the sight of this touching evidence of her human, loving heart all Leo\u2019s anger melted. Now it was he who grew penitent and prayed her pardon humbly. She gave him her hand in token of forgiveness, saying--\u201cLet others speak to me as they will\u201d (sorry should I have been to try it!) \u201cbut from thee, Leo, I cannot bear harsh words. Oh, thou art cruel, cruel. In what have I offended? Can I help it if my spirit keeps its watch upon thee, as indeed, though thou knewest it not, it has done ever since we parted yonder in the Place of Life? Can I help it if, like some mother who sees her little child at play upon a mountain\u2019s edge, my soul is torn with agony when I know thee in dangers that I am powerless to prevent or share? What are the lives of a few half-wild huntsmen that I should let them weigh for a single breath against thy safety, seeing that if I slew these, others would be more careful of thee? Whereas if I slay them not, they or their fellows may even lead thee into perils that would bring about--thy _death_,\u201d and she gasped with horror at the word.",
    "Leo--who had been considering her plans for conquest, and again combating them as best he could, for they were entirely repugnant to his religious, social and political views--said suddenly that after all they must break down, since they would involve the expenditure of sums of money so vast that even Ayesha herself would be unable to provide them by any known methods of taxation. She looked at him and laughed a little.\n\n\u201cVerily, Leo,\u201d she said, \u201cto thee, yes; and to Holly here I must seem as some madcap girl blown to and fro by every wind of fancy, and building me a palace wherein to dwell out of dew and vapours, or from the substance of the sunset fires. Thinkest thou then that I would enter on this war--one woman against all the world\u201d--and as she spoke her shape grew royal and in her awful eyes there came a look that chilled my blood--\u201cand make no preparation for its necessities? Why, since last we spoke upon this matter, foreseeing all, I have considered in my mind, and now thou shalt learn how, without cost to those we rule--and for that reason alone shall they love us dearly--I will glut the treasuries of the Empress of the Earth. Dost remember, Leo, how in K\u00f4r I found but a single pleasure during all those weary ages--that of forcing my mother Nature one by one to yield me up her choicest secrets; I, who am a student of all things which are and of the forces that cause them to be born. Now follow me, both of you, and ye shall look on what mortal eyes have not yet beheld.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we to see?\u201d I asked doubtfully, having a lively recollection of Ayesha\u2019s powers as a chemist.\n\n\u201cThat thou shalt learn, or shalt not learn if it pleases thee to stay behind. Come, Leo, my love, my love, and leave this wise philosopher first to find his riddle and next to guess it.\u201d\n\nThen turning her back to me she smiled on him so sweetly that although really he was more loth to go than I, Leo would have followed her through a furnace door, as indeed, had he but known it, he was about to do.\n\nSo they started, and I accompanied them since with Ayesha it was useless to indulge in any foolish pride, or to make oneself a victim to consistency. Also I was anxious to see her new marvel, and did not care to rely for an account of it upon Leo\u2019s descriptive skill, which at its best was never more than moderate.\n\nShe took us down passages that we had not passed before, to a door which she signed to Leo to open. He obeyed, and from the cave within issued a flood of light. As we guessed at once, the place was her laboratory, for about it stood metal flasks and various strange-shaped instruments. Moreover, there was a furnace in it, one of the best conceivable, for it needed neither fuel nor stoking, whose gaseous fires, like those of the twisted columns in the Sanctuary, sprang from the womb of the volcano beneath our feet.\n\nWhen we entered two priests were at work there: one of them stirring a cauldron with an iron rod and the other receiving its molten contents into a mould of clay. They stopped to salute Ayesha, but she bade them to continue their task, asking them if all went well.\n\n\u201cVery well, O Hes,\u201d they answered; and we passed through that cave and sundry doors and passages to a little chamber cut in the rock. There was no lamp or flame of fire in it, and yet the place was filled with a gentle light which seemed to flow from the opposing wall.\n\n\u201cWhat were those priests doing?\u201d I said, more to break the silence than for any other reason.\n\n\u201cWhy waste breath upon foolish questions?\u201d she replied. \u201cAre no metals smelted in thy country, O Holly? Now hadst thou sought to know what I am doing--But that, without seeing, thou wouldst not believe, so, Doubter, thou shalt see.\u201d\n\nThen she pointed to and bade us don, two strange garments that hung upon the wall, made of a material which seemed to be half cloth and half wood and having headpieces not unlike a diver\u2019s helmet.\n\nSo under her directions Leo helped me into mine, lacing it up behind, after which, or so I gathered from the sounds--for no light came through the helmet--she did the same service for him.\n\n\u201cI seem very much in the dark,\u201d I said presently; for now there was silence again, and beneath this extinguisher I felt alarmed and wished to be sure that I was not left alone.\n\n\u201cAye Holly,\u201d I heard Ayesha\u2019s mocking voice make answer, \u201cin the dark, as thou wast ever, the thick dark of ignorance and unbelief. Well, now, as ever also, I will give thee light.\u201d As she spoke I heard something roll back; I suppose that it must have been a stone door.\n\nThen, indeed, there was light, yes, even through the thicknesses of that prepared garment, such light as seemed to blind me. By it I saw that the wall opposite to us had opened and that we were all three of us, on the threshold of another chamber. At the end of it stood something like a little altar of hard, black stone, and on this altar lay a mass of substance of the size of a child\u2019s head, but fashioned, I suppose from fantasy, to the oblong shape of a human eye.\n\nOut of this eye there poured that blistering and intolerable light. It was shut round by thick, funnel-shaped screens of a material that looked like fire-brick, yet it pierced them as though they were but muslin. More, the rays thus directed upwards struck full upon a lump of metal held in place above them by a massive frame-work.\n\nAnd what rays they were! If all the cut diamonds of the world were brought together and set beneath a mighty burning-glass, the light flashed from them would not have been a thousandth part so brilliant. They scorched my eyes and caused the skin of my face and limbs to smart, yet Ayesha stood there unshielded from them. Aye, she even went down the length of the room and, throwing back her veil, bent over them, as it seemed a woman of molten steel in whose body the bones were visible, and examined the mass that was supported by the hanging cradle.\n\n\u201cIt is ready and somewhat sooner than I thought,\u201d she said. Then as though it were but a feather weight, she lifted the lump in her bare hands and glided back with it to where we stood, laughing and saying--\u201cTell me now, O thou well-read Holly, if thou hast ever heard of a better alchemist than this poor priestess of a forgotten faith?\u201d And she thrust the glowing substance up almost to the mask that hid my face.\n\nThen I turned and ran, or rather waddled, for in that gear I could not run, out of the chamber until the rock wall beyond stayed me, and there, with my back towards her, thrust my helmeted head against it, for I felt as though red-hot bradawls had been plunged into my eyes. So I stood while she laughed and mocked behind me until at length I heard the door close and the blessed darkness came like a gift from Heaven.",
    "She ceased speaking and gazed heavenwards with a rapt look as though she waited for some inspiration to fall upon her, and never, never--not even in the fires of K\u00f4r had Ayesha seemed so divine as she did now in this moment of the ripe harvest of her love.\n\nMy eyes wandered from her to Leo, who stood before her pale and still, still as the death-like figure of the Shaman, still as the Khania\u2019s icy shape which stared upwards from the ground. What was passing in his mind, I wondered, that he could remain thus insensible while in all her might and awful beauty this proud being worshipped him.\n\nHark! she began to sing in a voice so rich and perfect that its honied notes seemed to cloy my blood and stop my breath.\n\n\u201cThe world was not, was not, and in the womb of Silence Slept the souls of men. Yet I was and thou----\u201d\n\nSuddenly Ayesha stopped, and I felt rather than saw the horror on her face.\n\nLook! Leo swayed to and fro as though the stones beneath him were but a rocking boat. To and fro he swayed, stretched out his blind arms to clasp her--then suddenly fell backwards, and lay still.\n\nOh! what a shriek was that she gave! Surely it must have wakened the very corpses upon the plain. Surely it must have echoed in the stars. One shriek only--then throbbing silence.\n\nI sprang to him, and there, withered in Ayesha\u2019s kiss, slain by the fire of her love, Leo lay dead--lay dead upon the breast of dead Atene!\n\nI heard Ayesha say presently, and the words struck me as dreadful in their hopeless acceptance of a doom against which even she had no strength to struggle.\n\n\u201cIt seems that my lord has left me for awhile; I must hasten to my lord afar.\u201d\n\nAfter that I do not quite know what happened. I had lost the man who was all in all to me, friend and child in one, and I was crushed as I had never been before. It seemed so sad that I, old and outworn, should still live on whilst he in the flower of his age, snatched from joy and greatness such as no man hath known, lay thus asleep.\n\nI think that by an afterthought, Ayesha and Oros tried to restore him, tried without result, for here her powers were of no avail. Indeed my conviction is that although some lingering life still kept him on his feet, Leo had really died at the moment of her embrace, since when I looked at him before he fell, his face was that of a dead man.\n\nYes, I believe that last speech of hers, although she knew it not, was addressed to his spirit, for in her burning kiss his flesh had perished.\n\nWhen at length I recovered myself a little, it was to hear Ayesha in a cold, calm voice--her face I could not see for she had veiled herself--commanding certain priests who had been summoned to \u201cbear away the body of that accursed woman and bury her as befits her rank.\u201d Even then I bethought me, I remember, of the tale of Jehu and Jezebel.\n\nLeo, looking strangely calm and happy, lay now upon a couch, the arms folded on his breast. When the priests had tramped away carrying their royal burden, Ayesha, who sat by his body brooding, seemed to awake, for she rose and said--\u201cI need a messenger, and for no common journey, since he must search out the habitations of the Shades,\u201d and she turned herself towards Oros and appeared to look at him.\n\nNow for the first time I saw that priest change countenance a little, for the eternal smile, of which even this scene had not quite rid it, left his face and he grew pale and trembled.\n\n\u201cThou art afraid,\u201d she said contemptuously. \u201cBe at rest, Oros, I will not send one who is afraid. Holly, wilt thou go for me--and him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d I answered. \u201cI am weary of life and desire no other end. Only let it be swift and painless.\u201d\n\nShe mused a while, then said--\u201cNay, thy time is not yet, thou still hast work to do. Endure, my Holly, \u2018tis only for a breath.\u201d\n\nThen she looked at the Shaman, the man turned to stone who all this while had stood there as a statue stands, and cried--\u201cAwake!\u201d\n\nInstantly he seemed to thaw into life, his limbs relaxed, his breast heaved, he was as he had always been: ancient, gnarled, malevolent.\n\n\u201cI hear thee, mistress,\u201d he said, bowing as a man bows to the power that he hates.\n\n\u201cThou seest, Simbri,\u201d and she waved her hand.\n\n\u201cI see. Things have befallen as Atene and I foretold, have they not? \u2018Ere long the corpse of a new-crowned Khan of Kaloon,\u2019\u201d and he pointed to the gold circlet that Ayesha had set on Leo\u2019s brow, \u201c\u2018will lie upon the brink of the Pit of Flame\u2019--as I foretold.\u201d An evil smile crept into his eyes and he went on--\u201cHadst thou not smote me dumb, I who watched could have warned thee that they would so befall; but, great mistress, it pleased thee to smite me dumb. And so it seems, O Hes, that thou hast overshot thyself and liest broken at the foot of that pinnacle which step by step thou hast climbed for more than two thousand weary years. See what thou hast bought at the price of countless lives that now before the throne of Judgment bring accusations against thy powers misused, and cry out for justice on thy head,\u201d and he looked at the dead form of Leo."

  "Edgar Rice Burroughs -- Tarzan the Terrible": [
    "Silent as the shadows through which he moved, the great beast slunk through the midnight jungle, his yellow-green eyes round and staring, his sinewy tail undulating behind him, his head lowered and flattened, and every muscle vibrant to the thrill of the hunt. The jungle moon dappled an occasional clearing which the great cat was always careful to avoid. Though he moved through thick verdure across a carpet of innumerable twigs, broken branches, and leaves, his passing gave forth no sound that might have been apprehended by dull human ears.\n\nApparently less cautious was the hunted thing moving even as silently as the lion a hundred paces ahead of the tawny carnivore, for instead of skirting the moon-splashed natural clearings it passed directly across them, and by the tortuous record of its spoor it might indeed be guessed that it sought these avenues of least resistance, as well it might, since, unlike its grim stalker, it walked erect upon two feet--it walked upon two feet and was hairless except for a black thatch upon its head; its arms were well shaped and muscular; its hands powerful and slender with long tapering fingers and thumbs reaching almost to the first joint of the index fingers. Its legs too were shapely but its feet departed from the standards of all races of men, except possibly a few of the lowest races, in that the great toes protruded at right angles from the foot.\n\nPausing momentarily in the full light of the gorgeous African moon the creature turned an attentive ear to the rear and then, his head lifted, his features might readily have been discerned in the moonlight. They were strong, clean cut, and regular--features that would have attracted attention for their masculine beauty in any of the great capitals of the world. But was this thing a man? It would have been hard for a watcher in the trees to have decided as the lion's prey resumed its way across the silver tapestry that Luna had laid upon the floor of the dismal jungle, for from beneath the loin cloth of black fur that girdled its thighs there depended a long hairless, white tail.\n\nIn one hand the creature carried a stout club, and suspended at its left side from a shoulder belt was a short, sheathed knife, while a cross belt supported a pouch at its right hip. Confining these straps to the body and also apparently supporting the loin cloth was a broad girdle which glittered in the moonlight as though encrusted with virgin gold, and was clasped in the center of the belly with a huge buckle of ornate design that scintillated as with precious stones.\n\nCloser and closer crept Numa, the lion, to his intended victim, and that the latter was not entirely unaware of his danger was evidenced by the increasing frequency with which he turned his ear and his sharp black eyes in the direction of the cat upon his trail. He did not greatly increase his speed, a long swinging walk where the open places permitted, but he loosened the knife in its scabbard and at all times kept his club in readiness for instant action.\n\nForging at last through a narrow strip of dense jungle vegetation the man-thing broke through into an almost treeless area of considerable extent. For an instant he hesitated, glancing quickly behind him and then up at the security of the branches of the great trees waving overhead, but some greater urge than fear or caution influenced his decision apparently, for he moved off again across the little plain leaving the safety of the trees behind him. At greater or less intervals leafy sanctuaries dotted the grassy expanse ahead of him and the route he took, leading from one to another, indicated that he had not entirely cast discretion to the winds. But after the second tree had been left behind the distance to the next was considerable, and it was then that Numa walked from the concealing cover of the jungle and, seeing his quarry apparently helpless before him, raised his tail stiffly erect and charged.\n\nTwo months--two long, weary months filled with hunger, with thirst, with hardships, with disappointment, and, greater than all, with gnawing pain--had passed since Tarzan of the Apes learned from the diary of the dead German captain that his wife still lived. A brief investigation in which he was enthusiastically aided by the Intelligence Department of the British East African Expedition revealed the fact that an attempt had been made to keep Lady Jane in hiding in the interior, for reasons of which only the German High Command might be cognizant.\n\nIn charge of Lieutenant Obergatz and a detachment of native German troops she had been sent across the border into the Congo Free State.\n\nStarting out alone in search of her, Tarzan had succeeded in finding the village in which she had been incarcerated only to learn that she had escaped months before, and that the German officer had disappeared at the same time. From there on the stories of the chiefs and the warriors whom he quizzed, were vague and often contradictory. Even the direction that the fugitives had taken Tarzan could only guess at by piecing together bits of fragmentary evidence gleaned from various sources.\n\nSinister conjectures were forced upon him by various observations which he made in the village. One was incontrovertible proof that these people were man-eaters; the other, the presence in the village of various articles of native German uniforms and equipment. At great risk and in the face of surly objection on the part of the chief, the ape-man made a careful inspection of every hut in the village from which at least a little ray of hope resulted from the fact that he found no article that might have belonged to his wife.\n\nLeaving the village he had made his way toward the southwest, crossing, after the most appalling hardships, a vast waterless steppe covered for the most part with dense thorn, coming at last into a district that had probably never been previously entered by any white man and which was known only in the legends of the tribes whose country bordered it. Here were precipitous mountains, well-watered plateaus, wide plains, and vast swampy morasses, but neither the plains, nor the plateaus, nor the mountains were accessible to him until after weeks of arduous effort he succeeded in finding a spot where he might cross the morasses--a hideous stretch infested by venomous snakes and other larger dangerous reptiles. On several occasions he glimpsed at distances or by night what might have been titanic reptilian monsters, but as there were hippopotami, rhinoceri, and elephants in great numbers in and about the marsh he was never positive that the forms he saw were not of these.\n\nWhen at last he stood upon firm ground after crossing the morasses he realized why it was that for perhaps countless ages this territory had defied the courage and hardihood of the heroic races of the outer world that had, after innumerable reverses and unbelievable suffering penetrated to practically every other region, from pole to pole.\n\nFrom the abundance and diversity of the game it might have appeared that every known species of bird and beast and reptile had sought here a refuge wherein they might take their last stand against the encroaching multitudes of men that had steadily spread themselves over the surface of the earth, wresting the hunting grounds from the lower orders, from the moment that the first ape shed his hair and ceased to walk upon his knuckles. Even the species with which Tarzan was familiar showed here either the results of a divergent line of evolution or an unaltered form that had been transmitted without variation for countless ages.\n\nToo, there were many hybrid strains, not the least interesting of which to Tarzan was a yellow and black striped lion. Smaller than the species with which Tarzan was familiar, but still a most formidable beast, since it possessed in addition to sharp saber-like canines the disposition of a devil. To Tarzan it presented evidence that tigers had once roamed the jungles of Africa, possibly giant saber-tooths of another epoch, and these apparently had crossed with lions with the resultant terrors that he occasionally encountered at the present day.\n\nThe true lions of this new, Old World differed but little from those with which he was familiar; in size and conformation they were almost identical, but instead of shedding the leopard spots of cubhood, they retained them through life as definitely marked as those of the leopard.",
    "The creature who had raised the alarm had now reached the recess before Pan-at-lee's cave and here he halted and turned to give battle to Ta-den. Unslinging his club which had hung down his back from a thong about his neck he stood upon the level floor of the entrance-way effectually blocking Ta-den's ascent. From all directions the warriors of Kor-ul-JA were swarming toward the interlopers. Tarzan, who had reached a point on the same level with Ta-den but a little to the latter's left, saw that nothing short of a miracle could save them. Just at the ape-man's left was the entrance to a cave that either was deserted or whose occupants had not as yet been aroused, for the level recess remained unoccupied. Resourceful was the alert mind of Tarzan of the Apes and quick to respond were the trained muscles. In the time that you or I might give to debating an action he would accomplish it and now, though only seconds separated his nearest antagonist from him, in the brief span of time at his disposal he had stepped into the recess, unslung his long rope and leaning far out shot the sinuous noose, with the precision of long habitude, toward the menacing figure wielding its heavy club above Ta-den. There was a momentary pause of the rope-hand as the noose sped toward its goal, a quick movement of the right wrist that closed it upon its victim as it settled over his head and then a surging tug as, seizing the rope in both hands, Tarzan threw back upon it all the weight of his great frame.\n\nVoicing a terrified shriek, the Waz-don lunged headforemost from the recess above Ta-den. Tarzan braced himself for the coming shock when the creature's body should have fallen the full length of the rope and as it did there was a snap of the vertebrae that rose sickeningly in the momentary silence that had followed the doomed man's departing scream. Unshaken by the stress of the suddenly arrested weight at the end of the rope, Tarzan quickly pulled the body to his side that he might remove the noose from about its neck, for he could not afford to lose so priceless a weapon.\n\nDuring the several seconds that had elapsed since he cast the rope the Waz-don warriors had remained inert as though paralyzed by wonder or by terror. Now, again, one of them found his voice and his head and straightway, shrieking invectives at the strange intruder, started upward for the ape-man, urging his fellows to attack. This man was the closest to Tarzan. But for him the ape-man could easily have reached Ta-den's side as the latter was urging him to do. Tarzan raised the body of the dead Waz-don above his head, held it poised there for a moment as with face raised to the heavens he screamed forth the horrid challenge of the bull apes of the tribe of Kerchak, and with all the strength of his giant sinews he hurled the corpse heavily upon the ascending warrior. So great was the force of the impact that not only was the Waz-don torn from his hold but two of the pegs to which he clung were broken short in their sockets.\n\nAs the two bodies, the living and the dead, hurtled downward toward the foot of the cliff a great cry arose from the Waz-don. \"Jad-guru-don! Jad-guru-don!\" they screamed, and then: \"Kill him! Kill him!\"\n\nAnd now Tarzan stood in the recess beside Ta-den. \"Jad-guru-don!\" repeated the latter, smiling--\"The terrible man! Tarzan the Terrible! They may kill you, but they will never forget you.\"\n\n\"They shall not ki--What have we here?\" Tarzan's statement as to what \"they\" should not do was interrupted by a sudden ejaculation as two figures, locked in deathlike embrace, stumbled through the doorway of the cave to the outer porch. One was Om-at, the other a creature of his own kind but with a rough coat, the hairs of which seemed to grow straight outward from the skin, stiffly, unlike Om-at's sleek covering. The two were quite evidently well matched and equally evident was the fact that each was bent upon murder. They fought almost in silence except for an occasional low growl as one or the other acknowledged thus some new hurt.\n\nTarzan, following a natural impulse to aid his ally, leaped forward to enter the dispute only to be checked by a grunted admonition from Om-at. \"Back!\" he said. \"This fight is mine, alone.\"\n\nThe ape-man understood and stepped aside.\n\n\"It is a gund-bar,\" explained Ta-den, \"a chief-battle. This fellow must be Es-sat, the chief. If Om-at kills him without assistance Om-at may become chief.\"\n\nTarzan smiled. It was the law of his own jungle--the law of the tribe of Kerchak, the bull ape--the ancient law of primitive man that needed but the refining influences of civilization to introduce the hired dagger and the poison cup. Then his attention was drawn to the outer edge of the vestibule. Above it appeared the shaggy face of one of Es-sat's warriors. Tarzan sprang to intercept the man; but Ta-den was there ahead of him. \"Back!\" cried the Ho-don to the newcomer. \"It is gund-bar.\" The fellow looked scrutinizingly at the two fighters, then turned his face downward toward his fellows. \"Back!\" he cried, \"it is gund-bar between Es-sat and Om-at.\" Then he looked back at Ta-den and Tarzan. \"Who are you?\" he asked.\n\n\"We are Om-at's friends,\" replied Ta-den.\n\nThe fellow nodded. \"We will attend to you later,\" he said and disappeared below the edge of the recess.\n\nThe battle upon the ledge continued with unabated ferocity, Tarzan and Ta-den having difficulty in keeping out of the way of the contestants who tore and beat at each other with hands and feet and lashing tails. Es-sat was unarmed--Pan-at-lee had seen to that--but at Om-at's side swung a sheathed knife which he made no effort to draw. That would have been contrary to their savage and primitive code for the chief-battle must be fought with nature's weapons.\n\nSometimes they separated for an instant only to rush upon each other again with all the ferocity and nearly the strength of mad bulls. Presently one of them tripped the other but in that viselike embrace one could not fall alone--Es-sat dragged Om-at with him, toppling upon the brink of the niche. Even Tarzan held his breath. There they surged to and fro perilously for a moment and then the inevitable happened--the two, locked in murderous embrace, rolled over the edge and disappeared from the ape-man's view.\n\nTarzan voiced a suppressed sigh for he had liked Om-at and then, with Ta-den, approached the edge and looked over. Far below, in the dim light of the coming dawn, two inert forms should be lying stark in death; but, to Tarzan's amazement, such was far from the sight that met his eyes. Instead, there were the two figures still vibrant with life and still battling only a few feet below him. Clinging always to the pegs with two holds--a hand and a foot, or a foot and a tail, they seemed as much at home upon the perpendicular wall as upon the level surface of the vestibule; but now their tactics were slightly altered, for each seemed particularly bent upon dislodging his antagonist from his holds and precipitating him to certain death below. It was soon evident that Om-at, younger and with greater powers of endurance than Es-sat, was gaining an advantage. Now was the chief almost wholly on the defensive. Holding him by the cross belt with one mighty hand Om-at was forcing his foeman straight out from the cliff, and with the other hand and one foot was rapidly breaking first one of Es-sat's holds and then another, alternating his efforts, or rather punctuating them, with vicious blows to the pit of his adversary's stomach. Rapidly was Es-sat weakening and with the knowledge of impending death there came, as there comes to every coward and bully under similar circumstances, a crumbling of the veneer of bravado which had long masqueraded as courage and with it crumbled his code of ethics. Now was Es-sat no longer chief of Kor-ul-JA--instead he was a whimpering craven battling for life. Clutching at Om-at, clutching at the nearest pegs he sought any support that would save him from that awful fall, and as he strove to push aside the hand of death, whose cold fingers he already felt upon his heart, his tail sought Om-at's side and the handle of the knife that hung there.",
    "When Pan-at-lee stepped over the edge of the cliff above Kor-ul-lul she expected to be dashed to instant death upon the rocks below; but she had chosen this in preference to the rending fangs of JA. Instead, chance had ordained that she make the frightful plunge at a point where the tumbling river swung close beneath the overhanging cliff to eddy for a slow moment in a deep pool before plunging madly downward again in a cataract of boiling foam, and water thundering against rocks.\n\nInto this icy pool the girl shot, and down and down beneath the watery surface until, half choked, yet fighting bravely, she battled her way once more to air. Swimming strongly she made the opposite shore and there dragged herself out upon the bank to lie panting and spent until the approaching dawn warned her to seek concealment, for she was in the country of her people's enemies.\n\nRising, she moved into the concealment of the rank vegetation that grows so riotously in the well-watered kors of Pal-ul-don.\n\nHidden amidst the plant life from the sight of any who might chance to pass along the well-beaten trail that skirted the river Pan-at-lee sought rest and food, the latter growing in abundance all about her in the form of fruits and berries and succulent tubers which she scooped from the earth with the knife of the dead Es-sat.\n\nAh! if she had but known that he was dead! What trials and risks and terrors she might have been saved; but she thought that he still lived and so she dared not return to Kor-ul-JA. At least not yet while his rage was at white heat. Later, perhaps, her father and brothers returned to their cave, she might risk it; but not now--not now. Nor could she for long remain here in the neighborhood of the hostile Kor-ul-lul and somewhere she must find safety from beasts before the night set in.\n\nAs she sat upon the bole of a fallen tree seeking some solution of the problem of existence that confronted her, there broke upon her ears from up the gorge the voices of shouting men--a sound that she recognized all too well. It was the war cry of the Kor-ul-lul. Closer and closer it approached her hiding place. Then, through the veil of foliage she caught glimpses of three figures fleeing along the trail, and behind them the shouting of the pursuers rose louder and louder as they neared her. Again she caught sight of the fugitives crossing the river below the cataract and again they were lost to sight. And now the pursuers came into view--shouting Kor-ul-lul warriors, fierce and implacable. Forty, perhaps fifty of them. She waited breathless; but they did not swerve from the trail and passed her, unguessing that an enemy she lay hid within a few yards of them.\n\nOnce again she caught sight of the pursued--three Waz-don warriors clambering the cliff face at a point where portions of the summit had fallen away presenting a steep slope that might be ascended by such as these. Suddenly her attention was riveted upon the three. Could it be? O Jad-ben-Otho! had she but known a moment before. When they passed she might have joined them, for they were her father and two brothers. Now it was too late. With bated breath and tense muscles she watched the race. Would they reach the summit? Would the Kor-ul-lul overhaul them? They climbed well, but, oh, so slowly. Now one lost his footing in the loose shale and slipped back! The Kor-ul-lul were ascending--one hurled his club at the nearest fugitive. The Great God was pleased with the brother of Pan-at-lee, for he caused the club to fall short of its target, and to fall, rolling and bounding, back upon its owner carrying him from his feet and precipitating him to the bottom of the gorge.\n\nStanding now, her hands pressed tight above her golden breastplates, Pan-at-lee watched the race for life. Now one, her older brother, reached the summit and clinging there to something that she could not see he lowered his body and his long tail to the father beneath him. The latter, seizing this support, extended his own tail to the son below--the one who had slipped back--and thus, upon a living ladder of their own making, the three reached the summit and disappeared from view before the Kor-ul-lul overtook them. But the latter did not abandon the chase. On they went until they too had disappeared from sight and only a faint shouting came down to Pan-at-lee to tell her that the pursuit continued.\n\nThe girl knew that she must move on. At any moment now might come a hunting party, combing the gorge for the smaller animals that fed or bedded there.\n\nBehind her were Es-sat and the returning party of Kor-ul-lul that had pursued her kin; before her, across the next ridge, was the Kor-ul-GRYF, the lair of the terrifying monsters that brought the chill of fear to every inhabitant of Pal-ul-don; below her, in the valley, was the country of the Ho-don, where she could look for only slavery, or death; here were the Kor-ul-lul, the ancient enemies of her people and everywhere were the wild beasts that eat the flesh of man.\n\nFor but a moment she debated and then turning her face toward the southeast she set out across the gorge of water toward the Kor-ul-GRYF--at least there were no men there. As it is now, so it was in the beginning, back to the primitive progenitor of man which is typified by Pan-at-lee and her kind today, of all the hunters that woman fears, man is the most relentless, the most terrible. To the dangers of man she preferred the dangers of the GRYF.\n\nMoving cautiously she reached the foot of the cliff at the far side of Kor-ul-lul and here, toward noon, she found a comparatively easy ascent. Crossing the ridge she stood at last upon the brink of Kor-ul-GRYF--the horror place of the folklore of her race. Dank and mysterious grew the vegetation below; giant trees waved their plumed tops almost level with the summit of the cliff; and over all brooded an ominous silence.\n\nPan-at-lee lay upon her belly and stretching over the edge scanned the cliff face below her. She could see caves there and the stone pegs which the ancients had fashioned so laboriously by hand. She had heard of these in the firelight tales of her childhood and of how the gryfs had come from the morasses across the mountains and of how at last the people had fled after many had been seized and devoured by the hideous creatures, leaving their caves untenanted for no man living knew how long. Some said that Jad-ben-Otho, who has lived forever, was still a little boy. Pan-at-lee shuddered; but there were caves and in them she would be safe even from the gryfs.",
    "As Tarzan advanced upon the gryfs he imitated as closely as he could recall them the methods and mannerisms of the Tor-o-don, but up to the instant that he stood close beside one of the huge creatures he realized that his fate still hung in the balance, for the thing gave forth no sign, either menacing or otherwise. It only stood there, watching him out of its cold, reptilian eyes and then Tarzan raised his staff and with a menacing \"Whee-oo!\" struck the GRYF a vicious blow across the face.\n\nThe creature made a sudden side snap in his direction, a snap that did not reach him, and then turned sullenly away, precisely as it had when the Tor-o-don commanded it. Walking around to its rear as he had seen the shaggy first-man do, Tarzan ran up the broad tail and seated himself upon the creature's back, and then again imitating the acts of the Tor-o-don he prodded it with the sharpened point of his staff, and thus goading it forward and guiding it with blows, first upon one side and then upon the other, he started it down the gorge in the direction of the valley.\n\nAt first it had been in his mind only to determine if he could successfully assert any authority over the great monsters, realizing that in this possibility lay his only hope of immediate escape from his jailers. But once seated upon the back of his titanic mount the ape-man experienced the sensation of a new thrill that recalled to him the day in his boyhood that he had first clambered to the broad head of Tantor, the elephant, and this, together with the sense of mastery that was always meat and drink to the lord of the jungle, decided him to put his newly acquired power to some utilitarian purpose.\n\nPan-at-lee he judged must either have already reached safety or met with death. At least, no longer could he be of service to her, while below Kor-ul-GRYF, in the soft green valley, lay A-lur, the City of Light, which, since he had gazed upon it from the shoulder of Pastar-ul-ved, had been his ambition and his goal.\n\nWhether or not its gleaming walls held the secret of his lost mate he could not even guess but if she lived at all within the precincts of Pal-ul-don it must be among the Ho-don, since the hairy black men of this forgotten world took no prisoners. And so to A-lur he would go, and how more effectively than upon the back of this grim and terrible creature that the races of Pal-ul-don held in such awe?\n\nA little mountain stream tumbles down from Kor-ul-GRYF to be joined in the foothills with that which empties the waters of Kor-ul-lul into the valley, forming a small river which runs southwest, eventually entering the valley's largest lake at the City of A-lur, through the center of which the stream passes. An ancient trail, well marked by countless generations of naked feet of man and beast, leads down toward A-lur beside the river, and along this Tarzan guided the GRYF. Once clear of the forest which ran below the mouth of the gorge, Tarzan caught occasional glimpses of the city gleaming in the distance far below him.\n\nThe country through which he passed was resplendent with the riotous beauties of tropical verdure. Thick, lush grasses grew waist high upon either side of the trail and the way was broken now and again by patches of open park-like forest, or perhaps a little patch of dense jungle where the trees overarched the way and trailing creepers depended in graceful loops from branch to branch.\n\nAt times the ape-man had difficulty in commanding obedience upon the part of his unruly beast, but always in the end its fear of the relatively puny goad urged it on to obedience. Late in the afternoon as they approached the confluence of the stream they were skirting and another which appeared to come from the direction of Kor-ul-JA the ape-man, emerging from one of the jungle patches, discovered a considerable party of Ho-don upon the opposite bank. Simultaneously they saw him and the mighty creature he bestrode. For a moment they stood in wide-eyed amazement and then, in answer to the command of their leader, they turned and bolted for the shelter of the nearby wood.\n\nThe ape-man had but a brief glimpse of them but it was sufficient indication that there were Waz-don with them, doubtless prisoners taken in one of the raids upon the Waz-don villages of which Ta-den and Om-at had told him.\n\nAt the sound of their voices the GRYF had bellowed terrifically and started in pursuit even though a river intervened, but by dint of much prodding and beating, Tarzan had succeeded in heading the animal back into the path though thereafter for a long time it was sullen and more intractable than ever.\n\n\nAs the sun dropped nearer the summit of the western hills Tarzan became aware that his plan to enter A-lur upon the back of a GRYF was likely doomed to failure, since the stubbornness of the great beast was increasing momentarily, doubtless due to the fact that its huge belly was crying out for food. The ape-man wondered if the Tor-o-dons had any means of picketing their beasts for the night, but as he did not know and as no plan suggested itself, he determined that he should have to trust to the chance of finding it again in the morning.\n\nThere now arose in his mind a question as to what would be their relationship when Tarzan had dismounted. Would it again revert to that of hunter and quarry or would fear of the goad continue to hold its supremacy over the natural instinct of the hunting flesh-eater? Tarzan wondered but as he could not remain upon the GRYF forever, and as he preferred dismounting and putting the matter to a final test while it was still light, he decided to act at once.",
    "With the same assurance that you might venture upon the main street of a neighboring city Tarzan strode into the Ho-don city of A-lur. The first person to detect his spuriousness was a little child playing in the arched gateway of one of the walled buildings. \"No tail! no tail!\" it shouted, throwing a stone at him, and then it suddenly grew dumb and its eyes wide as it sensed that this creature was something other than a mere Ho-don warrior who had lost his tail. With a gasp the child turned and fled screaming into the courtyard of its home.\n\nTarzan continued on his way, fully realizing that the moment was imminent when the fate of his plan would be decided. Nor had he long to wait since at the next turning of the winding street he came face to face with a Ho-don warrior. He saw the sudden surprise in the latter's eyes, followed instantly by one of suspicion, but before the fellow could speak Tarzan addressed him.\n\n\"I am a stranger from another land,\" he said; \"I would speak with Ko-tan, your king.\"\n\nThe fellow stepped back, laying his hand upon his knife. \"There are no strangers that come to the gates of A-lur,\" he said, \"other than as enemies or slaves.\"\n\n\"I come neither as a slave nor an enemy,\" replied Tarzan. \"I come directly from Jad-ben-Otho. Look!\" and he held out his hands that the Ho-don might see how greatly they differed from his own, and then wheeled about that the other might see that he was tailless, for it was upon this fact that his plan had been based, due to his recollection of the quarrel between Ta-den and Om-at, in which the Waz-don had claimed that Jad-ben-Otho had a long tail while the Ho-don had been equally willing to fight for his faith in the taillessness of his god.\n\nThe warrior's eyes widened and an expression of awe crept into them, though it was still tinged with suspicion. \"Jad-ben-Otho!\" he murmured, and then, \"It is true that you are neither Ho-don nor Waz-don, and it is also true that Jad-ben-Otho has no tail. Come,\" he said, \"I will take you to Ko-tan, for this is a matter in which no common warrior may interfere. Follow me,\" and still clutching the handle of his knife and keeping a wary side glance upon the ape-man he led the way through A-lur.\n\nThe city covered a large area. Sometimes there was a considerable distance between groups of buildings, and again they were quite close together. There were numerous imposing groups, evidently hewn from the larger hills, often rising to a height of a hundred feet or more. As they advanced they met numerous warriors and women, all of whom showed great curiosity in the stranger, but there was no attempt to menace him when it was found that he was being conducted to the palace of the king.\n\nThey came at last to a great pile that sprawled over a considerable area, its western front facing upon a large blue lake and evidently hewn from what had once been a natural cliff. This group of buildings was surrounded by a wall of considerably greater height than any that Tarzan had before seen. His guide led him to a gateway before which waited a dozen or more warriors who had risen to their feet and formed a barrier across the entrance-way as Tarzan and his party appeared around the corner of the palace wall, for by this time he had accumulated such a following of the curious as presented to the guards the appearance of a formidable mob.\n\nThe guide's story told, Tarzan was conducted into the courtyard where he was held while one of the warriors entered the palace, evidently with the intention of notifying Ko-tan. Fifteen minutes later a large warrior appeared, followed by several others, all of whom examined Tarzan with every sign of curiosity as they approached.\n\nThe leader of the party halted before the ape-man. \"Who are you?\" he asked, \"and what do you want of Ko-tan, the king?\"\n\n\"I am a friend,\" replied the ape-man, \"and I have come from the country of Jad-ben-Otho to visit Ko-tan of Pal-ul-don.\"\n\nThe warrior and his followers seemed impressed. Tarzan could see the latter whispering among themselves.\n\n\"How come you here,\" asked the spokesman, \"and what do you want of Ko-tan?\"\n\nTarzan drew himself to his full height. \"Enough!\" he cried. \"Must the messenger of Jad-ben-Otho be subjected to the treatment that might be accorded to a wandering Waz-don? Take me to the king at once lest the wrath of Jad-ben-Otho fall upon you.\"\n\nThere was some question in the mind of the ape-man as to how far he might carry his unwarranted show of assurance, and he waited therefore with amused interest the result of his demand. He did not, however, have long to wait for almost immediately the attitude of his questioner changed. He whitened, cast an apprehensive glance toward the eastern sky and then extended his right palm toward Tarzan, placing his left over his own heart in the sign of amity that was common among the peoples of Pal-ul-don.",
    "Arrived at the great throneroom a new complication arose. Ko-tan would not acknowledge the right of Lu-don to occupy the apex of the pyramid and Lu-don would not consent to occupying an inferior position while Tarzan, to remain consistent with his high claims, insisted that no one should stand above him, but only to the ape-man was the humor of the situation apparent.\n\nTo relieve the situation Ja-don suggested that all three of them occupy the throne, but this suggestion was repudiated by Ko-tan who argued that no mortal other than a king of Pal-ul-don had ever sat upon the high eminence, and that furthermore there was not room for three there.\n\n\"But who,\" said Tarzan, \"is my accuser and who is my judge?\"\n\n\"Lu-don is your accuser,\" explained Ko-tan.\n\n\"And Lu-don is your judge,\" cried the high priest.\n\n\"I am to be judged by him who accuses me then,\" said Tarzan. \"It were better to dispense then with any formalities and ask Lu-don to sentence me.\" His tone was ironical and his sneering face, looking straight into that of the high priest, but caused the latter's hatred to rise to still greater proportions.\n\nIt was evident that Ko-tan and his warriors saw the justice of Tarzan's implied objection to this unfair method of dispensing justice. \"Only Ko-tan can judge in the throneroom of his palace,\" said Ja-don, \"let him hear Lu-don's charges and the testimony of his witnesses, and then let Ko-tan's judgment be final.\"\n\nKo-tan, however, was not particularly enthusiastic over the prospect of sitting in trial upon one who might after all very possibly be the son of his god, and so he temporized, seeking for an avenue of escape. \"It is purely a religious matter,\" he said, \"and it is traditional that the kings of Pal-ul-don interfere not in questions of the church.\"\n\n\"Then let the trial be held in the temple,\" cried one of the chiefs, for the warriors were as anxious as their king to be relieved of all responsibility in the matter. This suggestion was more than satisfactory to the high priest who inwardly condemned himself for not having thought of it before.\n\n\"It is true,\" he said, \"this man's sin is against the temple. Let him be dragged thither then for trial.\"\n\n\"The son of Jad-ben-Otho will be dragged nowhere,\" cried Tarzan. \"But when this trial is over it is possible that the corpse of Lu-don, the high priest, will be dragged from the temple of the god he would desecrate. Think well, then, Lu-don before you commit this folly.\"\n\nHis words, intended to frighten the high priest from his position failed utterly in consummating their purpose. Lu-don showed no terror at the suggestion the ape-man's words implied.\n\n\"Here is one,\" thought Tarzan, \"who, knowing more of his religion than any of his fellows, realizes fully the falsity of my claims as he does the falsity of the faith he preaches.\"\n\nHe realized, however, that his only hope lay in seeming indifference to the charges. Ko-tan and the warriors were still under the spell of their belief in him and upon this fact must he depend in the final act of the drama that Lu-don was staging for his rescue from the jealous priest whom he knew had already passed sentence upon him in his own heart.\n\nWith a shrug he descended the steps of the pyramid. \"It matters not to Dor-ul-Otho,\" he said, \"where Lu-don enrages his god, for Jad-ben-Otho can reach as easily into the chambers of the temple as into the throneroom of Ko-tan.\"\n\nImmeasurably relieved by this easy solution of their problem the king and the warriors thronged from the throneroom toward the temple grounds, their faith in Tarzan increased by his apparent indifference to the charges against him. Lu-don led them to the largest of the altar courts.\n\nTaking his place behind the western altar he motioned Ko-tan to a place upon the platform at the left hand of the altar and directed Tarzan to a similar place at the right.\n\nAs Tarzan ascended the platform his eyes narrowed angrily at the sight which met them. The basin hollowed in the top of the altar was filled with water in which floated the naked corpse of a new-born babe. \"What means this?\" he cried angrily, turning upon Lu-don.\n\nThe latter smiled malevolently. \"That you do not know,\" he replied, \"is but added evidence of the falsity of your claim. He who poses as the son of god did not know that as the last rays of the setting sun flood the eastern altar of the temple the lifeblood of an adult reddens the white stone for the edification of Jad-ben-Otho, and that when the sun rises again from the body of its maker it looks first upon this western altar and rejoices in the death of a new-born babe each day, the ghost of which accompanies it across the heavens by day as the ghost of the adult returns with it to Jad-ben-Otho at night.\n\n\"Even the little children of the Ho-don know these things, while he who claims to be the son of Jad-ben-Otho knows them not; and if this proof be not enough, there is more. Come, Waz-don,\" he cried, pointing to a tall slave who stood with a group of other blacks and priests on the temple floor at the left of the altar.\n\n\nThe fellow came forward fearfully. \"Tell us what you know of this creature,\" cried Lu-don, pointing to Tarzan.\n\n\"I have seen him before,\" said the Waz-don. \"I am of the tribe of Kor-ul-lul, and one day recently a party of which I was one encountered a few of the warriors of the Kor-ul-JA upon the ridge which separates our villages. Among the enemy was this strange creature whom they called Tarzan-jad-guru; and terrible indeed was he for he fought with the strength of many men so that it required twenty of us to subdue him. But he did not fight as a god fights, and when a club struck him upon the head he sank unconscious as might an ordinary mortal.\n\n\"We carried him with us to our village as a prisoner but he escaped after cutting off the head of the warrior we left to guard him and carrying it down into the gorge and tying it to the branch of a tree upon the opposite side.\"",
    "When night had fallen Tarzan donned the mask and the dead tail of the priest he had slain in the vaults beneath the temple. He judged that it would not do to attempt again to pass the guard, especially so late at night as it would be likely to arouse comment and suspicion, and so he swung into the tree that overhung the garden wall and from its branches dropped to the ground beyond. Avoiding too grave risk of apprehension the ape-man passed through the grounds to the court of the palace, approaching the temple from the side opposite to that at which he had left it at the time of his escape. He came thus it is true through a portion of the grounds with which he was unfamiliar but he preferred this to the danger of following the beaten track between the palace apartments and those of the temple. Having a definite goal in mind and endowed as he was with an almost miraculous sense of location he moved with great assurance through the shadows of the temple yard. Taking advantage of the denser shadows close to the walls and of what shrubs and trees there were he came without mishap at last to the ornate building concerning the purpose of which he had asked Lu-don only to be put off with the assertion that it was forgotten--nothing strange in itself but given possible importance by the apparent hesitancy of the priest to discuss its use and the impression the ape-man had gained at the time that Lu-don lied.\n\nAnd now he stood at last alone before the structure which was three stories in height and detached from all the other temple buildings. It had a single barred entrance which was carved from the living rock in representation of the head of a GRYF, whose wide-open mouth constituted the doorway. The head, hood, and front paws of the creature were depicted as though it lay crouching with its lower jaw on the ground between its outspread paws. Small oval windows, which were likewise barred, flanked the doorway. Seeing that the coast was clear, Tarzan stepped into the darkened entrance where he tried the bars only to discover that they were ingeniously locked in place by some device with which he was unfamiliar and that they also were probably too strong to be broken even if he could have risked the noise which would have resulted. Nothing was visible within the darkened interior and so, momentarily baffled, he sought the windows. Here also the bars refused to yield up their secret, but again Tarzan was not dismayed since he had counted upon nothing different.\n\nIf the bars would not yield to his cunning they would yield to his giant strength if there proved no other means of ingress, but first he would assure himself that this latter was the case. Moving entirely around the building he examined it carefully. There were other windows but they were similarly barred. He stopped often to look and listen but he saw no one and the sounds that he heard were too far away to cause him any apprehension.\n\nHe glanced above him at the wall of the building. Like so many of the other walls of the city, palace, and temple, it was ornately carved and there were too the peculiar ledges that ran sometimes in a horizontal plane and again were tilted at an angle, giving ofttimes an impression of irregularity and even crookedness to the buildings. It was not a difficult wall to climb, at least not difficult for the ape-man.\n\nBut he found the bulky and awkward headdress a considerable handicap and so he laid it aside upon the ground at the foot of the wall. Nimbly he ascended to find the windows of the second floor not only barred but curtained within. He did not delay long at the second floor since he had in mind an idea that he would find the easiest entrance through the roof which he had noticed was roughly dome shaped like the throneroom of Ko-tan. Here there were apertures. He had seen them from the ground, and if the construction of the interior resembled even slightly that of the throneroom, bars would not be necessary upon these apertures, since no one could reach them from the floor of the room.\n\nThere was but a single question: would they be large enough to admit the broad shoulders of the ape-man.\n\nHe paused again at the third floor, and here, in spite of the hangings, he saw that the interior was lighted and simultaneously there came to his nostrils from within a scent that stripped from him temporarily any remnant of civilization that might have remained and left him a fierce and terrible bull of the jungles of Kerchak. So sudden and complete was the metamorphosis that there almost broke from the savage lips the hideous challenge of his kind, but the cunning brute-mind saved him this blunder.\n\nAnd now he heard voices within--the voice of Lu-don he could have sworn, demanding. And haughty and disdainful came the answering words though utter hopelessness spoke in the tones of this other voice which brought Tarzan to the pinnacle of frenzy.\n\nThe dome with its possible apertures was forgotten. Every consideration of stealth and quiet was cast aside as the ape-man drew back his mighty fist and struck a single terrific blow upon the bars of the small window before him, a blow that sent the bars and the casing that held them clattering to the floor of the apartment within.\n\nInstantly Tarzan dove headforemost through the aperture carrying the hangings of antelope hide with him to the floor below. Leaping to his feet he tore the entangling pelt from about his head only to find himself in utter darkness and in silence. He called aloud a name that had not passed his lips for many weary months. \"Jane, Jane,\" he cried, \"where are you?\" But there was only silence in reply.\n\nAgain and again he called, groping with outstretched hands through the Stygian blackness of the room, his nostrils assailed and his brain tantalized by the delicate effluvia that had first assured him that his mate had been within this very room. And he had heard her dear voice combatting the base demands of the vile priest. Ah, if he had but acted with greater caution! If he had but continued to move with quiet and stealth he might even at this moment be holding her in his arms while the body of Lu-don, beneath his foot, spoke eloquently of vengeance achieved. But there was no time now for idle self-reproaches.\n\nHe stumbled blindly forward, groping for he knew not what till suddenly the floor beneath him tilted and he shot downward into a darkness even more utter than that above. He felt his body strike a smooth surface and he realized that he was hurtling downward as through a polished chute while from above there came the mocking tones of a taunting laugh and the voice of Lu-don screamed after him: \"Return to thy father, O Dor-ul-Otho!\"\n\nThe ape-man came to a sudden and painful stop upon a rocky floor. Directly before him was an oval window crossed by many bars, and beyond he saw the moonlight playing on the waters of the blue lake below. Simultaneously he was conscious of a familiar odor in the air of the chamber, which a quick glance revealed in the semidarkness as of considerable proportion.\n\nIt was the faint, but unmistakable odor of the GRYF, and now Tarzan stood silently listening. At first he detected no sounds other than those of the city that came to him through the window overlooking the lake; but presently, faintly, as though from a distance he heard the shuffling of padded feet along a stone pavement, and as he listened he was aware that the sound approached.\n\nNearer and nearer it came, and now even the breathing of the beast was audible. Evidently attracted by the noise of his descent into its cavernous retreat it was approaching to investigate. He could not see it but he knew that it was not far distant, and then, deafeningly there reverberated through those gloomy corridors the mad bellow of the GRYF.",
    "Jane had made her first kill and she was very proud of it. It was not a very formidable animal--only a hare; but it marked an epoch in her existence. Just as in the dim past the first hunter had shaped the destinies of mankind so it seemed that this event might shape hers in some new mold. No longer was she dependent upon the wild fruits and vegetables for sustenance. Now she might command meat, the giver of the strength and endurance she would require successfully to cope with the necessities of her primitive existence.\n\nThe next step was fire. She might learn to eat raw flesh as had her lord and master; but she shrank from that. The thought even was repulsive. She had, however, a plan for fire. She had given the matter thought, but had been too busy to put it into execution so long as fire could be of no immediate use to her. Now it was different--she had something to cook and her mouth watered for the flesh of her kill. She would grill it above glowing embers. Jane hastened to her tree. Among the treasures she had gathered in the bed of the stream were several pieces of volcanic glass, clear as crystal. She sought until she had found the one in mind, which was convex. Then she hurried to the ground and gathered a little pile of powdered bark that was very dry, and some dead leaves and grasses that had lain long in the hot sun. Near at hand she arranged a supply of dead twigs and branches--small and large.\n\nVibrant with suppressed excitement she held the bit of glass above the tinder, moving it slowly until she had focused the sun's rays upon a tiny spot. She waited breathlessly. How slow it was! Were her high hopes to be dashed in spite of all her clever planning? No! A thin thread of smoke rose gracefully into the quiet air. Presently the tinder glowed and broke suddenly into flame. Jane clasped her hands beneath her chin with a little gurgling exclamation of delight. She had achieved fire!\n\nShe piled on twigs and then larger branches and at last dragged a small log to the flames and pushed an end of it into the fire which was crackling merrily. It was the sweetest sound that she had heard for many a month. But she could not wait for the mass of embers that would be required to cook her hare. As quickly as might be she skinned and cleaned her kill, burying the hide and entrails. That she had learned from Tarzan. It served two purposes. One was the necessity for keeping a sanitary camp and the other the obliteration of the scent that most quickly attracts the man-eaters.\n\nThen she ran a stick through the carcass and held it above the flames. By turning it often she prevented burning and at the same time permitted the meat to cook thoroughly all the way through. When it was done she scampered high into the safety of her tree to enjoy her meal in quiet and peace. Never, thought Lady Greystoke, had aught more delicious passed her lips. She patted her spear affectionately. It had brought her this toothsome dainty and with it a feeling of greater confidence and safety than she had enjoyed since that frightful day that she and Obergatz had spent their last cartridge. She would never forget that day--it had seemed one hideous succession of frightful beast after frightful beast. They had not been long in this strange country, yet they thought that they were hardened to dangers, for daily they had had encounters with ferocious creatures; but this day--she shuddered when she thought of it. And with her last cartridge she had killed a black and yellow striped lion-thing with great saber teeth just as it was about to spring upon Obergatz who had futilely emptied his rifle into it--the last shot--his final cartridge. For another day they had carried the now useless rifles; but at last they had discarded them and thrown away the cumbersome bandoleers, as well. How they had managed to survive during the ensuing week she could never quite understand, and then the Ho-don had come upon them and captured her. Obergatz had escaped--she was living it all over again. Doubtless he was dead unless he had been able to reach this side of the valley which was quite evidently less overrun with savage beasts.\n\nJane's days were very full ones now, and the daylight hours seemed all too short in which to accomplish the many things she had determined upon, since she had concluded that this spot presented as ideal a place as she could find to live until she could fashion the weapons she considered necessary for the obtaining of meat and for self-defense.",
    "As Mo-sar carried Jane Clayton from the palace of Ko-tan, the king, the woman struggled incessantly to regain her freedom. He tried to compel her to walk, but despite his threats and his abuse she would not voluntarily take a single step in the direction in which he wished her to go. Instead she threw herself to the ground each time he sought to place her upon her feet, and so of necessity he was compelled to carry her though at last he tied her hands and gagged her to save himself from further lacerations, for the beauty and slenderness of the woman belied her strength and courage. When he came at last to where his men had gathered he was glad indeed to turn her over to a couple of stalwart warriors, but these too were forced to carry her since Mo-sar's fear of the vengeance of Ko-tan's retainers would brook no delays.\n\nAnd thus they came down out of the hills from which A-lur is carved, to the meadows that skirt the lower end of Jad-ben-lul, with Jane Clayton carried between two of Mo-sar's men. At the edge of the lake lay a fleet of strong canoes, hollowed from the trunks of trees, their bows and sterns carved in the semblance of grotesque beasts or birds and vividly colored by some master in that primitive school of art, which fortunately is not without its devotees today.\n\nInto the stern of one of these canoes the warriors tossed their captive at a sign from Mo-sar, who came and stood beside her as the warriors were finding their places in the canoes and selecting their paddles.\n\n\"Come, Beautiful One,\" he said, \"let us be friends and you shall not be harmed. You will find Mo-sar a kind master if you do his bidding,\" and thinking to make a good impression on her he removed the gag from her mouth and the thongs from her wrists, knowing well that she could not escape surrounded as she was by his warriors, and presently, when they were out on the lake, she would be as safely imprisoned as though he held her behind bars.\n\nAnd so the fleet moved off to the accompaniment of the gentle splashing of a hundred paddles, to follow the windings of the rivers and lakes through which the waters of the Valley of Jad-ben-Otho empty into the great morass to the south. The warriors, resting upon one knee, faced the bow and in the last canoe Mo-sar tiring of his fruitless attempts to win responses from his sullen captive, squatted in the bottom of the canoe with his back toward her and resting his head upon the gunwale sought sleep.\n\nThus they moved in silence between the verdure-clad banks of the little river through which the waters of Jad-ben-lul emptied--now in the moonlight, now in dense shadow where great trees overhung the stream, and at last out upon the waters of another lake, the black shores of which seemed far away under the weird influence of a moonlight night.\n\nJane Clayton sat alert in the stern of the last canoe. For months she had been under constant surveillance, the prisoner first of one ruthless race and now the prisoner of another. Since the long-gone day that Hauptmann Fritz Schneider and his band of native German troops had treacherously wrought the Kaiser's work of rapine and destruction on the Greystoke bungalow and carried her away to captivity she had not drawn a free breath. That she had survived unharmed the countless dangers through which she had passed she attributed solely to the beneficence of a kind and watchful Providence.",
    "When Tarzan realized the trick that had been so neatly played upon him he had awaited expectantly the coming of the lion, for though the scent of JA was old he was sure that sooner or later they would let one of the beasts in upon him. His first consideration was a thorough exploration of his prison. He had noticed the hide-covered windows and these he immediately uncovered, letting in the light, and revealing the fact that though the chamber was far below the level of the temple courts it was yet many feet above the base of the hill from which the temple was hewn. The windows were so closely barred that he could not see over the edge of the thick wall in which they were cut to determine what lay close in below him. At a little distance were the blue waters of Jad-in-lul and beyond, the verdure-clad farther shore, and beyond that the mountains. It was a beautiful picture upon which he looked--a picture of peace and harmony and quiet. Nor anywhere a slightest suggestion of the savage men and beasts that claimed this lovely landscape as their own. What a paradise! And some day civilized man would come and--spoil it! Ruthless axes would raze that age-old wood; black, sticky smoke would rise from ugly chimneys against that azure sky; grimy little boats with wheels behind or upon either side would churn the mud from the bottom of Jad-in-lul, turning its blue waters to a dirty brown; hideous piers would project into the lake from squalid buildings of corrugated iron, doubtless, for of such are the pioneer cities of the world.\n\n\nBut would civilized man come? Tarzan hoped not. For countless generations civilization had ramped about the globe; it had dispatched its emissaries to the North Pole and the South; it had circled Pal-ul-don once, perhaps many times, but it had never touched her. God grant that it never would. Perhaps He was saving this little spot to be always just as He had made it, for the scratching of the Ho-don and the Waz-don upon His rocks had not altered the fair face of Nature.\n\n\nThrough the windows came sufficient light to reveal the whole interior to Tarzan. The room was fairly large and there was a door at each end--a large door for men and a smaller one for lions. Both were closed with heavy masses of stone that had been lowered in grooves running to the floor. The two windows were small and closely barred with the first iron that Tarzan had seen in Pal-ul-don. The bars were let into holes in the casing, and the whole so strongly and neatly contrived that escape seemed impossible. Yet within a few minutes of his incarceration Tarzan had commenced to undertake his escape. The old knife in his pouch was brought into requisition and slowly the ape-man began to scrape and chip away the stone from about the bars of one of the windows. It was slow work but Tarzan had the patience of absolute health.\n\n\nEach day food and water were brought him and slipped quickly beneath the smaller door which was raised just sufficiently to allow the stone receptacles to pass in. The prisoner began to believe that he was being preserved for something beside lions. However that was immaterial. If they would but hold off for a few more days they might select what fate they would--he would not be there when they arrived to announce it.\n\n\nAnd then one day came Pan-sat, Lu-don's chief tool, to the city of Tu-lur. He came ostensibly with a fair message for Mo-sar from the high priest at A-lur. Lu-don had decided that Mo-sar should be king and he invited Mo-sar to come at once to A-lur and then Pan-sat, having delivered the message, asked that he might go to the temple of Tu-lur and pray, and there he sought the high priest of Tu-lur to whom was the true message that Lu-don had sent. The two were closeted alone in a little chamber and Pan-sat whispered into the ear of the high priest.\n\n\n\"Mo-sar wishes to be king,\" he said, \"and Lu-don wishes to be king. Mo-sar wishes to retain the stranger who claims to be the Dor-ul-Otho and Lu-don wishes to kill him, and now,\" he leaned even closer to the ear of the high priest of Tu-lur, \"if you would be high priest at A-lur it is within your power.\"\n\n\nPan-sat ceased speaking and waited for the other's reply. The high priest was visibly affected. To be high priest at A-lur! That was almost as good as being king of all Pal-ul-don, for great were the powers of him who conducted the sacrifices upon the altars of A-lur.\n\n\n\"How?\" whispered the high priest. \"How may I become high priest at A-lur?\"\n\n\nAgain Pan-sat leaned close: \"By killing the one and bringing the other to A-lur,\" replied he. Then he rose and departed knowing that the other had swallowed the bait and could be depended upon to do whatever was required to win him the great prize.\n\n\nNor was Pan-sat mistaken other than in one trivial consideration. This high priest would indeed commit murder and treason to attain the high office at A-lur; but he had misunderstood which of his victims was to be killed and which to be delivered to Lu-don. Pan-sat, knowing himself all the details of the plannings of Lu-don, had made the quite natural error of assuming that the other was perfectly aware that only by publicly sacrificing the false Dor-ul-Otho could the high priest at A-lur bolster his waning power and that the assassination of Mo-sar, the pretender, would remove from Lu-don's camp the only obstacle to his combining the offices of high priest and king. The high priest at Tu-lur thought that he had been commissioned to kill Tarzan and bring Mo-sar to A-lur. He also thought that when he had done these things he would be made high priest at A-lur; but he did not know that already the priest had been selected who was to murder him within the hour that he arrived at A-lur, nor did he know that a secret grave had been prepared for him in the floor of a subterranean chamber in the very temple he dreamed of controlling.\n\n\nAnd so when he should have been arranging the assassination of his chief he was leading a dozen heavily bribed warriors through the dark corridors beneath the temple to slay Tarzan in the lion pit. Night had fallen. A single torch guided the footsteps of the murderers as they crept stealthily upon their evil way, for they knew that they were doing the thing that their chief did not want done and their guilty consciences warned them to stealth.\n\n\nIn the dark of his cell the ape-man worked at his seemingly endless chipping and scraping. His keen ears detected the coming of footsteps along the corridor without--footsteps that approached the larger door. Always before had they come to the smaller door--the footsteps of a single slave who brought his food. This time there were many more than one and their coming at this time of night carried a sinister suggestion. Tarzan continued to work at his scraping and chipping. He heard them stop beyond the door. All was silence broken only by the scrape, scrape, scrape of the ape-man's tireless blade.\n\n\nThose without heard it and listening sought to explain it. They whispered in low tones making their plans. Two would raise the door quickly and the others would rush in and hurl their clubs at the prisoner. They would take no chances, for the stories that had circulated in A-lur had been brought to Tu-lur--stories of the great strength and wonderful prowess of Tarzan-jad-guru that caused the sweat to stand upon the brows of the warriors, though it was cool in the damp corridor and they were twelve to one.\n\n\nAnd then the high priest gave the signal--the door shot upward and ten warriors leaped into the chamber with poised clubs. Three of the heavy weapons flew across the room toward a darker shadow that lay in the shadow of the opposite wall, then the flare of the torch in the priest's hand lighted the interior and they saw that the thing at which they had flung their clubs was a pile of skins torn from the windows and that except for themselves the chamber was vacant.\n\n\nOne of them hastened to a window. All but a single bar was gone and to this was tied one end of a braided rope fashioned from strips cut from the leather window hangings.",
    "To the ordinary dangers of Jane Clayton's existence was now added the menace of Obergatz' knowledge of her whereabouts. The lion and the panther had given her less cause for anxiety than did the return of the unscrupulous Hun, whom she had always distrusted and feared, and whose repulsiveness was now immeasurably augmented by his unkempt and filthy appearance, his strange and mirthless laughter, and his unnatural demeanor. She feared him now with a new fear as though he had suddenly become the personification of some nameless horror. The wholesome, outdoor life that she had been leading had strengthened and rebuilt her nervous system yet it seemed to her as she thought of him that if this man should ever touch her she should scream, and, possibly, even faint. Again and again during the day following their unexpected meeting the woman reproached herself for not having killed him as she would JA or JATO or any other predatory beast that menaced her existence or her safety. There was no attempt at self-justification for these sinister reflections--they needed no justification. The standards by which the acts of such as you or I may be judged could not apply to hers. We have recourse to the protection of friends and relatives and the civil soldiery that upholds the majesty of the law and which may be invoked to protect the righteous weak against the unrighteous strong; but Jane Clayton comprised within herself not only the righteous weak but all the various agencies for the protection of the weak. To her, then, Lieutenant Erich Obergatz presented no different problem than did JA, the lion, other than that she considered the former the more dangerous animal. And so she determined that should he ignore her warning there would be no temporizing upon the occasion of their next meeting--the same swift spear that would meet JA's advances would meet his.\n\n\nThat night her snug little nest perched high in the great tree seemed less the sanctuary that it had before. What might resist the sanguinary intentions of a prowling panther would prove no great barrier to man, and influenced by this thought she slept less well than before. The slightest noise that broke the monotonous hum of the nocturnal jungle startled her into alert wakefulness to lie with straining ears in an attempt to classify the origin of the disturbance, and once she was awakened thus by a sound that seemed to come from something moving in her own tree. She listened intently--scarce breathing. Yes, there it was again. A scuffing of something soft against the hard bark of the tree. The woman reached out in the darkness and grasped her spear. Now she felt a slight sagging of one of the limbs that supported her shelter as though the thing, whatever it was, was slowly raising its weight to the branch. It came nearer. Now she thought that she could detect its breathing. It was at the door. She could hear it fumbling with the frail barrier. What could it be? It made no sound by which she might identify it. She raised herself upon her hands and knees and crept stealthily the little distance to the doorway, her spear clutched tightly in her hand. Whatever the thing was, it was evidently attempting to gain entrance without awakening her. It was just beyond the pitiful little contraption of slender boughs that she had bound together with grasses and called a door--only a few inches lay between the thing and her. Rising to her knees she reached out with her left hand and felt until she found a place where a crooked branch had left an opening a couple of inches wide near the center of the barrier. Into this she inserted the point of her spear. The thing must have heard her move within for suddenly it abandoned its efforts for stealth and tore angrily at the obstacle. At the same moment Jane thrust her spear forward with all her strength. She felt it enter flesh. There was a scream and a curse from without, followed by the crashing of a body through limbs and foliage. Her spear was almost dragged from her grasp, but she held to it until it broke free from the thing it had pierced.\n\n\nIt was Obergatz; the curse had told her that. From below came no further sound. Had she, then, killed him? She prayed so--with all her heart she prayed it. To be freed from the menace of this loathsome creature were relief indeed. During all the balance of the night she lay there awake, listening. Below her, she imagined, she could see the dead man with his hideous face bathed in the cold light of the moon--lying there upon his back staring up at her.\n\n\nShe prayed that JA might come and drag it away, but all during the remainder of the night she heard never another sound above the drowsy hum of the jungle. She was glad that he was dead, but she dreaded the gruesome ordeal that awaited her on the morrow, for she must bury the thing that had been Erich Obergatz and live on there above the shallow grave of the man she had slain.\n\n\nShe reproached herself for her weakness, repeating over and over that she had killed in self-defense, that her act was justified; but she was still a woman of today, and strong upon her were the iron mandates of the social order from which she had sprung, its interdictions and its superstitions.\n\n\nAt last came the tardy dawn. Slowly the sun topped the distant mountains beyond Jad-in-lul. And yet she hesitated to loosen the fastenings of her door and look out upon the thing below. But it must be done. She steeled herself and untied the rawhide thong that secured the barrier. She looked down and only the grass and the flowers looked up at her. She came from her shelter and examined the ground upon the opposite side of the tree--there was no dead man there, nor anywhere as far as she could see. Slowly she descended, keeping a wary eye and an alert ear ready for the first intimation of danger.\n\n\nAt the foot of the tree was a pool of blood and a little trail of crimson drops upon the grass, leading away parallel with the shore of Jad-ben-lul. Then she had not slain him! She was vaguely aware of a peculiar, double sensation of relief and regret. Now she would be always in doubt. He might return; but at least she would not have to live above his grave.\n\n\nShe thought some of following the bloody spoor on the chance that he might have crawled away to die later, but she gave up the idea for fear that she might find him dead nearby, or, worse yet badly wounded. What then could she do? She could not finish him with her spear--no, she knew that she could not do that, nor could she bring him back and nurse him, nor could she leave him there to die of hunger or of thirst, or to become the prey of some prowling beast. It were better then not to search for him for fear that she might find him.\n\n\nThat day was one of nervous starting to every sudden sound. The day before she would have said that her nerves were of iron; but not today. She knew now the shock that she had suffered and that this was the reaction. Tomorrow it might be different, but something told her that never again would her little shelter and the patch of forest and jungle that she called her own be the same. There would hang over them always the menace of this man. No longer would she pass restful nights of deep slumber. The peace of her little world was shattered forever.",
    "The inner temple court was packed with humanity. At either end of the western altar stood Tarzan and his mate, bound and helpless. The sounds of battle had ceased and presently the ape-man saw Ja-don being led into the inner court, his wrists bound tightly together before him. Tarzan turned his eyes toward Jane and nodded in the direction of Ja-don. \"This looks like the end,\" he said quietly. \"He was our last and only hope.\"\n\n\n\"We have at least found each other, John,\" she replied, \"and our last days have been spent together. My only prayer now is that if they take you they do not leave me.\"\n\n\nTarzan made no reply for in his heart was the same bitter thought that her own contained--not the fear that they would kill him but the fear that they would not kill her. The ape-man strained at his bonds but they were too many and too strong. A priest near him saw and with a jeering laugh struck the defenseless ape-man in the face.\n\n\n\"The brute!\" cried Jane Clayton.\n\n\nTarzan smiled. \"I have been struck thus before, Jane,\" he said, \"and always has the striker died.\"\n\n\n\"You still have hope?\" she asked.\n\n\n\"I am still alive,\" he said as though that were sufficient answer. She was a woman and she did not have the courage of this man who knew no fear. In her heart of hearts she knew that he would die upon the altar at high noon for he had told her, after he had been brought to the inner court, of the sentence of death that Obergatz had pronounced upon him, and she knew too that Tarzan knew that he would die, but that he was too courageous to admit it even to himself.\n\n\nAs she looked upon him standing there so straight and wonderful and brave among his savage captors her heart cried out against the cruelty of the fate that had overtaken him. It seemed a gross and hideous wrong that that wonderful creature, now so quick with exuberant life and strength and purpose should be presently naught but a bleeding lump of clay--and all so uselessly and wantonly. Gladly would she have offered her life for his but she knew that it was a waste of words since their captors would work upon them whatever it was their will to do--for him, death; for her--she shuddered at the thought.\n\n\nAnd now came Lu-don and the naked Obergatz, and the high priest led the German to his place behind the altar, himself standing upon the other's left. Lu-don whispered a word to Obergatz, at the same time nodding in the direction of Ja-don. The Hun cast a scowling look upon the old warrior.\n\n\n\"And after the false god,\" he cried, \"the false prophet,\" and he pointed an accusing finger at Ja-don. Then his eyes wandered to the form of Jane Clayton.\n\n\n\"And the woman, too?\" asked Lu-don.\n\n\n\"The case of the woman I will attend to later,\" replied Obergatz. \"I will talk with her tonight after she has had a chance to meditate upon the consequences of arousing the wrath of Jad-ben-Otho.\"\n\n\nHe cast his eyes upward at the sun. \"The time approaches,\" he said to Lu-don. \"Prepare the sacrifice.\"\n\n\nLu-don nodded to the priests who were gathered about Tarzan. They seized the ape-man and lifted him bodily to the altar where they laid him upon his back with his head at the south end of the monolith, but a few feet from where Jane Clayton stood. Impulsively and before they could restrain her the woman rushed forward and bending quickly kissed her mate upon the forehead. \"Good-bye, John,\" she whispered.\n\n\n\"Good-bye,\" he answered, smiling.\n\n\nThe priests seized her and dragged her away. Lu-don handed the sacrificial knife to Obergatz. \"I am the Great God,\" cried the German, \"thus falleth the divine wrath upon all my enemies!\" He looked up at the sun and then raised the knife high above his head.\n\n\n\"Thus die the blasphemers of God!\" he screamed, and at the same instant a sharp staccato note rang out above the silent, spell-bound multitude. There was a screaming whistle in the air and Jad-ben-Otho crumpled forward across the body of his intended victim. Again the same alarming noise and Lu-don fell, a third and Mo-sar crumpled to the ground. And now the warriors and the people, locating the direction of this new and unknown sound turned toward the western end of the court.\n\n\nUpon the summit of the temple wall they saw two figures--a Ho-don warrior and beside him an almost naked creature of the race of Tarzan-jad-guru, across his shoulders and about his hips were strange broad belts studded with beautiful cylinders that glinted in the mid-day sun, and in his hands a shining thing of wood and metal from the end of which rose a thin wreath of blue-gray smoke.\n\n\nAnd then the voice of the Ho-don warrior rang clear upon the ears of the silent throng. \"Thus speaks the true Jad-ben-Otho,\" he cried, \"through this his Messenger of Death. Cut the bonds of the prisoners. Cut the bonds of the Dor-ul-Otho and of Ja-don, King of Pal-ul-don, and of the woman who is the mate of the son of god.\"\n\n\nPan-sat, filled with the frenzy of fanaticism saw the power and the glory of the regime he had served crumpled and gone. To one and only one did he attribute the blame for the disaster that had but just overwhelmed him. It was the creature who lay upon the sacrificial altar who had brought Lu-don to his death and toppled the dreams of power that day by day had been growing in the brain of the under priest.\n\n\nThe sacrificial knife lay upon the altar where it had fallen from the dead fingers of Obergatz. Pan-sat crept closer and then with a sudden lunge he reached forth to seize the handle of the blade, and even as his clutching fingers were poised above it, the strange thing in the hands of the strange creature upon the temple wall cried out its crashing word of doom and Pan-sat the under priest, screaming, fell back upon the dead body of his master.\n\n\n\"Seize all the priests,\" cried Ta-den to the warriors, \"and let none hesitate lest Jad-ben-Otho's messenger send forth still other bolts of lightning.\"\n\n\nThe warriors and the people had now witnessed such an exhibition of divine power as might have convinced an even less superstitious and more enlightened people, and since many of them had but lately wavered between the Jad-ben-Otho of Lu-don and the Dor-ul-Otho of Ja-don it was not difficult for them to swing quickly back to the latter, especially in view of the unanswerable argument in the hands of him whom Ta-den had described as the Messenger of the Great God."

  "H. Rider Haggard -- The People of the Mist": [
    "Still the silence endured, and still the moonlight grew, creeping lower and lower till it shone upon the face of the seething waters, and, except in the immediate shadow of the walls, all the amphitheatre was full of it. Then the voice of Nam spoke again from far away, and Leonard looked to see whence he spoke. Now he saw. Nam, attended by three priests, was perched like an eagle on the left palm of the colossus, and from this dizzy platform he addressed the multitude. Looking across the breast of the statue, Leonard could just see the outstretched arm and the fierce face of the high priest as he glared down upon the people.\n\n\u201cHearken, ye Dwellers in the Mist, Children of the Snake! Ye have seen your ancient gods, your Father and your Mother, come back to rule you and to lead you on through war to peace, to wealth, to power, and to glory. Ye see them now by that light and in that place wherein only it is lawful that ye should look upon them. Say, do ye believe and do ye accept them? Answer, every one of you, answer with your voice!\u201d\n\nThen a mighty roar of sound went up from the gathered thousands, a roar that shaped itself into the words:\n\n\u201cWe believe and we accept.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well,\u201d said Nam when the tumult had died away. \u201cHearken, ye high gods! O Aca! and O J\u00e2l! Bend down your ears and deign to hearken to your priest and servant, speaking in the name of your children, the People of the Mist. Be ye kings to reign over us! Accept the power and the sacrifice, and sit in the place of kings. We give you rule through all the land; the life of every dweller in the land is yours; yours are their cattle and their goats, their city and their armies. For you the altars shall run red, the cry of the victim shall be music in your ears. Ye shall look upon him whom long ago ye set to guard the secret awful place, and he shall crawl beneath your feet. As ye ruled our fathers so ye shall rule us, according to the customs which ye laid down for ever. Glory be to you, O Aca, and to you, O J\u00e2l! immortal kings for evermore!\u201d\n\nAnd in a shout that rent the skies the great audience echoed: \u201cGlory be to you, O Aca, and to you, O J\u00e2l, immortal kings for evermore!\u201d\n\nThen Nam spoke again, saying: \u201cBring forth the virgin, that fair maid who is destined to the Snake, that he may look upon her and accept her as his wife. Bring her forth also who, twelve months gone, was vowed in marriage to the Shape of stone, that she may bid her lord farewell.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke there was a stir behind the idol, and presently from each side of it a woman was led forward by two priests on to the little space of rock between its feet and the edge of the gulf, and placed one to the right of the altar, and one to the left. Both these women were tall and lovely with the dark and somewhat terrifying beauty of the People of the Mist, but there the resemblance between them ended. She to the right was naked except for a girdle of snake-skin and the covering of her abundant hair, which was crowned with a wreath of red lilies similar to the flower that the priests had given to Juanna. She to the left, on the contrary, was clothed in a black robe round which was broidered the shape of a blood-red snake, whose head rested upon her breast. Leonard noticed that the appearance of this woman was that of extreme terror, for she shrank and trembled, whereas that of the flower-crowned bride was jubilant and even haughty.\n\nFor a moment the two women stood still while the people gazed upon them. Then, at a signal from Nam, she who was crowned with flowers was led before the altar, and thrice she bowed the knee to the idol, or rather to Otter who sat upon it. Now all eyes were fixed on the dwarf, who stared at the girl but made no sign, which was not wonderful, seeing that he had no inkling of the meaning of the ceremony. As it chanced, he could not have acted more wisely, at least in the interests of the bride, for here, as elsewhere, silence was held to give consent.\n\n\u201cBehold, the god accepts,\u201d cried Nam, \u201cthe beauty of the maid is pleasing in his eyes. Stand aside, Saga, the blessed, that the people may look upon you and know you. Hail to you, wife of the Snake!\u201d\n\nSmiling triumphantly the girl moved back to her place by the altar, and turned her proud face to the people. Then the multitude shouted:\n\n\u201cHail to you, bride of the Snake! Hail to you, the blessed, chosen of the god!\u201d\n\nWhile the tumult still lasted, the woman who was clad in the black robe was led forward, and when it had died away she also made her obeisance before the idol.\n\n\u201cAway with her that she may seek her Lord in his own place,\u201d cried Nam.\n\n\u201cAway with her, her day is done,\u201d echoed the multitude. Then, before Juanna could interfere, before she could even speak, for, be it remembered, she alone understood all that was said, the two priests who guarded the doomed woman rent the robe from her and with one swing of their strong arms hurled her backwards far into the pool of seething waters.\n\nShe fell with a shriek and lay floating on their surface, flung this way and that by the eddy of the whirlpool just where the moonlight beat most brightly. All who could of the multitude bent forward to see her end, and overcome by a fearful fascination, Leonard threw himself on his face, and, craning his head over the stone of the idol\u2019s hand, watched also, for the girl\u2019s struggling shape was almost immediately beneath him. Another minute and he would have foregone the hope of winning the treasure which he had come so far to seek, not to have yielded to the impulse.\n\nFor as he stared, the waters beneath the feet of the idol were agitated as a pond is agitated by the rush of a pike when he dashes at his prey. Then for an instant the light gleamed upon a dull enormous shape, and suddenly the head of a crocodile reared itself out of the pool. The head of a crocodile, but of such a crocodile as he had never heard or dreamed of, for this head alone was broader than the breast of the biggest man, its dull eyes were the size of a man\u2019s fist, its yellow fangs were like the teeth of a lion, and from its lower jaw hung tentacles or lumps of white flesh which at that distance gave it the appearance of being bearded like a goat. Also, the skin of this huge reptile, which could not have measured less than fifty feet in length by four feet in depth, was here and there corroded into rusty excrescences, as though some fungus or lichen had grown upon it like grey moss on an ancient wall. Indeed, its appearance seemed to point to extreme antiquity.\n\nHearing the disturbance in the water, the reptile had emerged from the cave where it dwelt beneath the feet of the idol, to seek its accustomed food, which consisted of the human victims that were cast to it at certain intervals. It reared its hideous head and glared round, then of a sudden the monster and the victim vanished together into the depths.\n\nSick with horror Leonard drew himself back into a sitting posture, and glanced up at Juanna. She was crouched in her ivory chair overcome, and her eyes were closed, either through faintness or to shut out the sight of dread. Then he looked down at Otter. The dwarf, staring fixedly at the water, sat still as the stone effigy that supported him. Evidently in all his varied experience he had seen no such thing as this.\n\n\u201cThe Snake has accepted the sacrifice,\u201d cried Nam again; \u201cthe Snake has taken her who was his bride to dwell with him in his holy house. Let the offerings be completed, for this is but the first-fruit. Take Olfan who was king, and offer him up. Cast down the white servants of the Mother, and offer them up. Seize the slaves who stood before her in the plain, and offer them up. Lead forth the captives, and offer them up. Let the sacrifice of the Crowning of Kings be accomplished according to custom, that the god whose name is J\u00e2l may be appeased; that he may listen to the pleadings of the Mother, that the sun may shine upon us, that fruitfulness may fill the land and peace be within its gates.\u201d\n\nThus he cried while Leonard felt his blood turn cold and his hair rise upon his head, for though he could not understand the words, he guessed their purport and his instinct told him that a great danger threatened them. He looked at the two priests who stood by, and they glared hungrily on him in answer. Then his courage came back to him; at least he had his rifle and would fight for his life. It must go hard if he could not put a bullet through one or both of them before they got a hold of him.\n\nMeanwhile the priests below had seized the king Olfan, whose giant form they were dragging towards the stone of sacrifice. But of a sudden, for the first time Juanna spoke, and a deep silence fell upon the temple and all within it.",
    "The procession being formed, they were led solemnly to a different gate of the temple from that by which they had entered it on their previous visits. On this occasion the secret passages were avoided, and they passed up a broad avenue though the centre of the amphitheatre, to seats that had been prepared for them on that side of the pool which was furthest from the colossal idol. As before, the temple was crowded with human beings, and their advance through it was very impressive, for the priests chanted as they walked, while the multitude preserved an ominous silence.\n\nAt first Leonard was at a loss to know why they were placed on the hither side of the pool, but presently he saw the reason. In front of the chairs to be occupied by Juanna and Otter, an open space of rock was left, semicircular in shape, on which were set other seats to the number of thirty or more. These seats were allotted to elders of the people, who, as Leonard guessed rightly, had been chosen to act as their judges. The position was selected for the convenience of these elders, and in order that the words they spoke might be heard by a larger proportion of their vast audience.\n\nWhen Juanna and Otter were seated, and Leonard and Francisco had taken their places behind them, Nam came forward to address the Council and the multitude beyond.\n\n\u201cElders of the People of the Mist,\u201d he said, \u201cI have conveyed your wishes to the holy gods, who but lately have deigned to put on the flesh of men to visit us their people; namely, that they should meet you here and talk with you of the trouble which has come upon the land. And now the gracious gods have assented to your wish, and behold, they are face to face with you and with this great company of their children. Be pleased therefore to make known what you desire to the gods, that they may answer you, either with their own mouths or by the voice of me, their servant.\u201d\n\nHe ceased, and after a pause, during which the people murmured angrily, an elder rose and said:\n\n\u201cWe would know of you how it is, O Aca and O J\u00e2l, that the summer has deserted the land. Now our strait is very sorry, for famine will come upon us with the winter snows. A while ago, O Aca and O J\u00e2l, you changed the worship of this people, forbidding the victims who had been prepared to be offered up at the spring festival, and lo! there has been no spring. Therefore we ask a word of you on this matter, for the people have consulted together, and say by our voice that they will have no gods who kill the spring. Speak, O ye gods, and you, Nam, speak also, for we would learn the reason of these evils; and from you, O Nam, we would learn how it comes that you have proclaimed gods in the land whose breath has destroyed the sunshine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe ask me, O People of the Mist,\u201d answered Juanna, \u201cwhy it is that the winter stretches out his hand over the slumber of the spring, forbidding her to awake, and I will answer you in few words and short. It is because of your disobedience and the hardness of your hearts, O ye rebellious children. Did ye not do sacrifice when we forbade you to take the blood of men? Ay, and have not our servants been stolen secretly away and put to death to satisfy your lust for slaughter? It is for this reason, because of your disobedience, that the heavens have grown hard as your own hearts and will not bless you with their sunshine and their gentle rain. I have answered you.\u201d\n\nThen again the spokesman of the elders rose and said:\n\n\u201cWe have heard your words, O Aca, and they are words of little comfort, for to sacrifice is the custom of the land, and hitherto no evil has befallen us because of that ancient custom. Yet if there has been offence, it is not we who have offended, but rather the priests in whose hands these matters lie; and as for your servants, we know nothing of them, or of their fate. Now, Nam, make answer to the charges of the gods, and to the questions of the people, for you are the chief of their servants and you have proclaimed them to be true gods and set them over us to rule us.\u201d\n\nThus adjured, Nam stood forward, and his mien was humble and anxious, for he saw well that his accusers were not to be trifled with, and that his life, or at least his power, was at stake, together with those of the gods.\n\n\u201cChildren of the Mist,\u201d he began, \u201cyour words are sharp, yet I do not complain of them, for, as ye shall learn, my fault has been grievous. Truly, I am the chief of the servants of the gods, and I am also the servant of the people, and now it would seem that I have betrayed both gods and people, though not of my own will. Listen: ye know the legend that has come down to us, that Aca and J\u00e2l should reappear in the land, wearing the shapes of a fair white maiden and of a black dwarf. Ye know also how they came as had been promised, and how I showed them to you here in this temple, and ye accepted them. Ye remember that then they put away the ancient law and forbade the sacrifices, and by the hand of their servant who is named Deliverer, they destroyed two of the priests, my brethren, in a strange and terrible fashion. Then I murmured, though they threatened me with death, but ye overruled my words and accepted the new law, and from that hour all things have gone ill. Now I took counsel with my heart, for it seemed wonderful to me that the gods should discard their ancient worship, and I said to my heart: Can these be true gods, or have I perchance been duped? Thenceforward I held my peace, and set myself to watch, and now after much watching\u2014alas! I must say it to my shame\u2014I have discovered that they are no true gods, but wicked liars who have sought to usurp the places of the gods.\u201d\n\nHe paused, and a roar of rage and astonishment went up from the assembled thousands.\n\n\u201cIt has come at last,\u201d whispered Leonard into Juanna\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cYes, it has come,\u201d she answered. \u201cWell, I expected it, and now we must face it out.\u201d\n\nWhen the tumult had subsided, the spokesman of the elders addressed Nam, saying:\n\n\u201cThese are heavy words, O Nam, and having uttered them you must prove them, for until they are proved we will not believe readily that there are human beings so wicked that they dare to name themselves as gods. When you proclaimed these strangers to be Aca and J\u00e2l, we accepted them, perhaps too easily and after too short a search. Now you denounce them as liars, but we will not disclaim them whom we have once received till we are sure that there is no room for error. It may chance, Nam, that it would please you well to cast aside those gods who have threatened you with death and do not love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should be bold indeed,\u201d answered Nam, \u201cif I dared to speak as I have spoken lacking testimony to establish a charge so dreadful as that which I bring against these wanderers. Nor should I seek to publish my own shame and folly were I not forced thereto by knowledge that, did I conceal it, would make me a partner of their crime. Listen, this is the tale of those whom we have worshipped: the fair woman, as she herself told us, is named Shepherdess of the Heavens, and she is the wife of the white man who is named Deliverer, and the dwarf Dweller in the Waters is their servant, together with the second white man and the others. Dwelling in a far country, these men and women chanced to learn the story of our people\u2014how, I shall show you presently\u2014and also that we find in the earth and use in the ceremonies of our temple certain red and blue stones which among the white people are of priceless value. These they determined to steal, being adventurers who seek after wealth. To this end the Shepherdess learned our language, also she learned how to play the part of Aca, while the dwarf, dog that he is, dared to take the holy name of J\u00e2l. I will be short: they accomplished their journey, and the rest you know. But, as it happened, none of the stones they covet have come into their hands, except that gem which the Shepherdess wears upon her forehead, and this she brought with her. Now, People of the Mist, when doubts of these gods had entered into me I made a plan: I set spies to watch them in the palace yonder, those spies being the wife who was given to the dwarf and her handmaidens. Also, I caused their black servants to be seized and thrown to the Snake, one or two of them at a time, for of this I was sure, that if they had the power they would protect their servants. But, as the Snake knows, those men were not protected. Meanwhile reports came to me from the women, and more especially from Saga, the granddaughter of my brother, who was given as a bride to J\u00e2l. And this was their report: that the dwarf behaved himself like a cur of low birth, and that when he was in liquor, which was often, he babbled of his doings with the Deliverer in other lands, though all that he said they could not tell me because even now he has little knowledge of our tongue. When these tales came to my ears, you may guess, O People of the Mist, that if I had doubted before, now my heart was shaken, and yet I had no proof. In my darkness I prayed to the gods for light, and lo! light came. Among the followers of these wanderers was a woman, and but yesterday this woman visited me and confessed all. Forty years ago she had fled from among our people\u2014I know not why, but she took with her a knowledge of our secrets. It was she who told them of the gods and the story of the gods, and she instructed them how they should deceive us and win the red stones which they desired. But now her heart repents her of the evil, and I will summon her before you, that ye may judge between me and these liars who have brought me to this shame. Bring forth the woman.\u201d\n\nThere was a silence, and so intense was the interest that no sound came from the audience, which watched for the appearance of the witness. Presently Soa advanced from the shadows at the foot of the colossus, and escorted by two priests took her stand in the centre of the semicircle of judges.",
    "Keeping himself carefully under the overshadowing edge of the rock-bank, and holding his double-bladed knife ready in one hand, Otter swam to the mouth of the Snake\u2019s den. As he approached it he perceived by the great upward force of the water that the real body of the stream entered the pool from below, the hole where the crocodile lived being but a supplementary exit, which doubtless the river followed in times of flood.\n\nOtter reached the mouth of the tunnel without any great difficulty, and, watching his chance, he lifted himself on his hands and slipped through it quickly, for he did not desire to be seen by those who were gathered above. Nor indeed was he seen, for his red head-dress and the goat-skin cloak had been washed away or cast off in the pool, and in that light his black body made little show against the black rock beneath.\n\nNow he was inside the hole, and found himself crouching upon a bed of sand, or rather disintegrated rock, brought down by the waters. The gloom of the place was great, but the light of the white dawn, which had turned to red, was gathering swiftly on the surface of the pool without as the mist melted, and thence was reflected into the tunnel. So it came about that very soon Otter, who had the gift, not uncommon among savages, of seeing in anything short of absolute darkness, was able to make out his surroundings with tolerable accuracy. The place in a corner of which he squatted was a cave of no great height or width, hollowed in the solid rock by the force of water, as smoothly as though it had been hewn by the hand of man: in short, an enormous natural drain-pipe, but constructed of stone instead of earthenware.\n\nIn the bottom of this drain trickled a stream of water nowhere more than six inches in depth, on either side of which, for ten feet or more, lay a thick bed of debris ground small. How far the cave stretched of course he could not see, nor as yet could he discover the whereabouts of its hideous occupant, though traces of its presence were plentiful, for the sandy floor was marked with its huge footprints, and the air reeked with an abominable stink.\n\n\u201cWhere has this evil spirit gone to?\u201d thought Otter; \u201che must be near, and yet I can see nothing of him. Perhaps he lives further up the cave\u201d; and he crept a pace or two forward and again peered into the gloom.\n\nNow he perceived what had hitherto escaped him, namely, that some eight yards from the mouth of the tunnel a table-shaped fragment of stone rose from its floor to within six feet of the roof, having on the hither side a sloping plane that connected its summit with the stream-bed beneath. Doubtless this fragment or boulder, being of some harder material than the surrounding rock, had resisted the wear of the rushing river; the top of it, as was shown by the high-water marks on the sides of the cave, being above the level of the torrent, which, although it was now represented only by a rivulet, evidently at certain seasons of the year poured down with great force and volume.\n\n\u201cHere is a bed on which a crocodile might sleep,\u201d reflected Otter, creeping a little further forward and staring at the mass of rock, and more especially at a triangular-shaped object that was poised on the top of the sloping plane, and on something which lay beneath it.\n\n\u201cNow, if that thing be another stone,\u201d thought Otter again, \u201chow comes it that it does not slip into the water as it should do, and what is that upon which it rests?\u201d and he took a step to one side to prevent his body from intercepting any portion of the ray of light that momentarily shone clearer and pierced the darkness of the cave to a greater distance.\n\nThen he looked again and almost fell in his horror, for now he could see all. The thing that he had taken for a stone set upon the rock-table was the head of the Dweller in the Waters, for there in it, as the light struck on them, two dreadful eyes gleamed with a dull and changing fire. Moreover, he discovered what was the object which lay under the throat of the reptile. It was the body of that priest whom Otter had taken with him in his leap from the statue, for he could see the dead face projecting on one side.\n\n\u201cPerhaps if I wait awhile he will begin to eat him,\u201d reflected the dwarf, remembering the habits of crocodiles, \u201cand then I can attack him when he rests and sleeps afterwards\u201d; and, acting on this idea, he stood still, watching the green fire as it throbbed and quivered, waxed and waned in the monster\u2019s eyes.\n\nHow long he remained thus Otter never knew; but after a time he became conscious that these eyes had taken hold of him and were drawing him towards them, though whether the reptile saw him or not he could not tell. For a space he struggled against this unholy fascination; then, overcome by dread, he strove to fly, back to the pool or anywhere out of reach of those devilish orbs. Alas! it was too late: no step could he move backwards, no, not to save his life.\n\nNow he must go on. It was as though the Water Dweller had read his mind, and drew its foe towards itself to put the matter to the test. Otter took one step forward\u2014rather would he have sprung again off the head of the colossus\u2014and the eyes glowed more dreadfully than ever, as though in triumph.\n\nThen in despair he sank to the ground, hiding his face in his hands and groaning in his heart.\n\n\u201cThis is a devil that I have come to fight, a devil with magic in his eyes,\u201d he thought. \u201cAnd how can I, who am but a common Knobnose dwarf, do battle against the king of evil spirits, clothed in the shape of a crocodile?\u201d\n\nEven now, when he could not see them, he felt the eyes drawing him. Yet, as they were no longer visible, his courage and power of mind came back to him sufficiently to enable him to think again.\n\n\u201cOtter,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cif you stay thus, soon the magic will do its work. Your sense will leave you, and that devil will eat you up as a cobra devours a meer-cat. Yes, he will swallow you, and his inside will be your grave, and that is no end for one who has been called a god! Men, let alone gods, should die fighting, whether it be with other men, with wild beasts, with snakes, or with devils. Think now, if your master, the Deliverer, saw you crouch thus like a toad before an adder, how he would laugh and say, \u2018Ho! I thought this man brave. Ho! he talked very loud about fighting the Water Dweller, he who came of a line of warriors; but now I laugh at him, for I see that he is but a cross-bred cur and a coward.\u2019 Yes, yes, you can hear his words, Otter. Say now, will you bear their shame and sit here until you are snapped up and swallowed?\u201d\n\nThus the dwarf addressed himself, and it seemed to his bewildered brain that the words which he had imagined were true, and that Leonard really stood by and mocked him.\n\nAt last he sprang to his feet, and crying, \u201cNever, Baas!\u201d so loudly that the cave rang with the echoes of his shout, he rushed straight at the foe, holding the two-bladed knife in his right hand.\n\nThe crocodile, that was waiting for him to fall insensible, as had ever been the custom of the living victims on whom it fixed its baneful glare, heard his cry and awoke from its seeming torpor. It lifted its head, fire seemed to flash from its dull eyes, its vast length began to stir. Higher and higher it reared its head, then of a sudden it leaped from the slope of rock, as alligators when disturbed leap from a river bank into the water, coming so heavily to the ground that the shock caused the cave to tremble, and stood before the dwarf with its tail arched upwards over its back.\n\nAgain Otter shouted, half in rage and half in terror, and the sound seemed to make the brute more furious. It opened its huge mouth as though to seize him and waddled a few paces forward, halting within six feet of him. Now the dwarf\u2019s chance had come and he knew it, for with the opportunity all his courage and skill returned to him. It was he who sprang and not the crocodile. He sprang, he thrust his arm and the double knife far into the yawning mouth, and for a second held it there, one end pointing upwards to the brain and one to the tongue beneath. He felt the jaws close, but their rows of yellow fangs never touched his arm, for there was that between them which held them some little space apart. Then he cast himself on one side and to the ground, leaving the weapon in the reptile\u2019s throat.\n\nFor a few moments it shook its horrible head, while Otter watched gasping, for the reek of the brute\u2019s breath almost overpowered him. Twice it opened its great jaws and spat, and twice it strove to close them. Oh! what if it should rid itself of the knife, or drive it through the soft flesh of the throat? Then he was lost indeed! But this it might not do, for the lower blade caught upon the jawbone, and at each effort it drove the sharp point of the upper knife deeper towards its brain. Moreover, so good was the steel, and so firm were the hide bindings of the handles, shrunken as they were with the wet, that nothing broke or gave.\n\n\u201cNow he will trample me or dash me to pieces with his tail,\u201d said Otter; but as yet the Snake had no such mind\u2014indeed, in its agony it seemed to have forgotten the presence of its foe. It writhed upon the floor of the cave, lashing the rock with its tail, and gasping horribly the while. Then suddenly it started forward past him, and the tough hide rope about Otter\u2019s middle ran out like the line from the bow of a whale-boat when the harpoon has gone home in the quarry. Thrice the dwarf spun round violently, then he felt himself dragged in great jerks along the rocky floor, which, happily for him, was smooth. A fourth jerk, and once more he was in the waters of the pool, ay, and being carried to its remotest depths.",
    "Abandoning this attempt, the dwarf crept cautiously to the mouth of the cave and peered at the further banks of the pool, whence he could hear shouts and see men moving to and fro, apparently in a state of great excitement. \u201cNow I am weary of that pool,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cand if I am seen in it the Great People will surely shoot at me with arrows and kill me. What shall I do, then? I cannot stay in this place of stinks with the dead devil and the bones of those whom he has devoured, until I die of hunger. Yet this water must come from somewhere, therefore it seems best that I should follow it awhile, searching for the spot where it enters the cave. It will be dark walking, but the walls and the floor are smooth, so that I shall not hurt myself, and if I find nothing I can return again and strive to escape from the pool by night.\u201d\n\nHaving decided upon the adventure, Otter began to carry it out with characteristic promptness, the more readily, indeed, because his long immersion in the water had chilled him, and he felt a weariness creeping over him as a result of the terrible struggle and emotions that he had passed through. Coiling the hide rope about his middle, which was sadly cut by its chafing, he started with an uncertain gait, for he was still very weak. A few steps brought him to that rock on which he had discovered the head of the reptile, and he paused to examine it. Climbing the sloping stone\u2014no easy task, for it was smooth as ice\u2014he came to the table-like top. On its edge lay the body of that priest who had shared his fall from the head of the colossus.\n\nThen he inspected the surface of the rock, and for the first time understood how old that monster must have been which he had conquered in single combat. For there, where its body had lain from generation to generation, and perhaps from century to century, the hard material was worn away to the depth of two feet or more, while at the top of the sloping stone was a still deeper niche, wherein its head reposed as it lay keeping its sleepless watch on the waters of the pool. Around this depression, and strewn about the floor of the cave itself, were the remains of many victims, a considerable number of whom had not been devoured. In every case, however, the larger bones were broken, and from this circumstance Otter judged that, although it was the custom of this dreadful reptile to crush the life out of all who were thrown to it with a bite of its fangs, yet, like that of other animals, its appetite was limited, and it was only occasionally that it consumed what it had killed.\n\nThe sight of these remains was so unpleasant and suggestive that even Otter, who certainly could not be called squeamish, hastened to descend the rock. As he passed round it his attention was attracted by the skeleton of a man who, from various indications, must have been alive within the last few weeks. The bones were clad in a priest\u2019s cloak, of which the dwarf, who was trembling with cold, hastened to possess himself. As he picked up the robe he observed beneath it a bag of tanned ox-hide that doubtless had once been carried by the owner of the cloak. \u201cPerhaps he kept food in this,\u201d thought Otter; \u201cthough what he who came to visit the Water Dweller should want with food I cannot guess. At the least it will be bad by now, so I will leave it and be gone. Only a vulture would stay for long in this house of the dead.\u201d Then he started forward.\n\nFor a few yards more he had light to guide his steps, but very soon the darkness became complete; still the cave was not difficult to travel, for everywhere the rock was smooth and the water shallow. All that he needed to do was to walk straight on, keeping touch of one side of the tunnel with one hand. Indeed he had but two things to fear, that he should fall into some pit and that he might suddenly encounter another crocodile, \u201cfor doubtless,\u201d thought Otter, \u201cthe devil was married.\u201d\n\nBut Otter fell into no hole and he saw no crocodile, since, as it chanced, the Water Dweller of the People of the Mist was a bachelor. When the dwarf had travelled up a steep slope for rather more than half an hour, to his intense joy he saw light before him and hurried towards it. Presently he reached the further mouth of the cavern that was almost closed by blocks of ice, among which a little water trickled. Creeping through an aperture he found himself upon the crest of the impassable precipice at the back of the city, and that before him a vast glacier of green ice stretched upwards, whereon the sun shone gloriously.",
    "\u201cWhich way are we to go now?\u201d said Juanna; \u201cmust we climb down this great gulf?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Shepherdess,\u201d answered Otter; \u201csee, before you is a bridge,\u201d and he pointed to the band of ice and rock which traversed the wide ravine.\n\u201cA bridge?\u201d gasped Juanna, \u201cwhy it is as slippery as a slide and steep as the side of a house. A fly could not keep its footing on it.\u201d\n\u201cLook here, Otter,\u201d put in Leonard, \u201ceither you are joking or you are mad. How can we cross that place? We should be dashed to pieces before we had gone ten yards.\u201d\n\u201cThus, Baas: we must sit each of us on one of the flat stones that lie round here, then the stone will take us across of itself. I know, for I have tried it.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean to tell me that you have been over there on a rock?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Baas, but I have sent three stones over. Two crossed safely, I watched them go the whole way, and one vanished in the middle. I think that there is a hole there, but we must risk that. If the stone is heavy enough it will jump it, if not, then we shall go down the hole and be no more troubled.\u201d\n\u201cGreat heavens!\u201d said Leonard, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand, \u201cthis is practical tobogganing with a vengeance. Is there no other way?\u201d\n\u201cI can see none, Baas, except for the birds, and I think that we had better stop talking and make ready, for the priests are still behind us. If you will watch on the neck here so that we are not surprised, I will seek stones to carry us.\u201d\n\u201cHow about this man?\u201d said Leonard, pointing to Nam, who lay face downwards on the snow, apparently in a dead faint.\n\u201cOh! we must keep him a while, Baas; he may be useful if those priests come. If not, I will talk with him before we start. He is asleep and cannot run away.\u201d\n\nThen Leonard went to the top of the neck, which was distant some twenty yards, and Otter began to search for stones suitable to his purpose. As for Juanna, she turned her back to the ice-bridge, at which she scarcely dared to look, and sat herself upon a rock. In doing so the jewels in the bag struck against her knee and jingled, and the thought came into her mind that she would examine them while she waited, partly because she desired to distract her thoughts from the vision of this new and terrible ordeal which lay before her, and partly to gratify a not unnatural curiosity. Opening the mouth of the bag, she thrust her fingers into it, and one by one drew out the biggest gems which were jumbled together there, placing them on the rock beside her. In less than a minute she was feasting her eyes upon such a collection of priceless jewels as had never before gladdened the sight of any white woman, even in her wildest dreams; indeed, till now Juanna had not thought it possible that stones so splendid could exist on the hither side of the walls of heaven.\n\nFirst there were great sapphires roughly squared, and two enormous round star rubies: these had formed the eyes of the colossus, which were removed on the morrow of their arrival, the star rubies representing the blood-red pupils. Then there was a heart-shaped ruby of perfect colour and without flaw, almost as large as a jackdaw\u2019s egg, which on the days of sacrifice had adorned the breasts of the chief priests of the People of the Mist for many generations. Next came the greatest wonders of this treasure, two marvellous stones, one a sapphire and one a ruby, fashioned respectively into models of the statue of the Dwarf and of the hideous shape of the Water-Dweller. Then there were others\u2014dozens of them\u2014some rudely cut and polished, and some as they came from the earth, but every one of them singled out for its remarkable size and flawlessness, or its perfect fire and beauty.\n\nJuanna arranged them in rows and stared at them with ecstasy\u2014where is the woman who would not have done so?\u2014till in contemplating them she even forgot the present terrors of her position\u2014forgot everything except the gorgeous loveliness and infinite value of the wealth of gems, which she had been the means of winning for Leonard. Among other things that passed from her mind at this moment was the presence of Nam, who, overcome by rage and exhaustion, lay in a seeming faint upon the snow within twelve paces of her. She never saw him lift his head and look at her with an expression as cold and cruel as that which Otter had seen in the eyes of the Water-Dweller, when he lifted _his_ head from its bed of rock. She never saw him roll slowly over and over across the snow towards her, pausing a while between each turn of his body, for now she was occupied in replacing the jewels one by one into their bag of leather.\n\nAt last all were in, and with a sigh\u2014for it was sad to lose sight of objects so beautiful\u2014Juanna drew the mouth of the bag tight and prepared to place it round her neck. At this moment it was that a hand, withered and lean with age, passed beneath her eyes, and, swiftly as the snatch of an eagle\u2019s talon, seized the bag and rent it from her grasp. She sprang up with a cry of dismay, and well might she be dismayed, for there, running from her with incredible speed, was Nam, the jewels in his hand. Otter and Leonard heard her cry, and, thinking that the priest was escaping, sped to cut him off. But he had no idea of escape, at least not of such escape as they expected. Some forty yards from where Juanna had been sitting, a little promontory of rock jutted out over the unclimbable gulf below them and towards this spot Nam directed his steps. Running along the ridge he halted at its end: indeed he must do, unless he would fall a thousand feet or more to the bottom of the ravine beneath. Then he turned and faced his pursuers, who by now had reached the edge of the cliff.",
    "\u201cI understand,\u201d said Mr. Turner, breaking in on a silence which he felt to be painful, \u201cthat you will be able to produce the necessary proofs of identity within the next few days, and then we can get the will proved in the usual form. Meanwhile, you must want money, which I will take the risk of advancing you,\u201d and he wrote a cheque for a hundred pounds and gave it to Leonard.\n\nHalf an hour later Leonard and Juanna were alone in a room at their hotel, but as yet scarcely a word had passed between them since they left the lawyer\u2019s office.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see, Leonard,\u201d his wife said almost fiercely, \u201cit is most amusing, you made a mistake. Your brother\u2019s dying prophecy was like a Delphic oracle\u2014it could be taken two ways, and, of course, you adopted the wrong interpretation. You left Grave Mountain a day too soon. It was by _Jane Beach\u2019s_ help that you were to recover Outram, not by mine,\u201d and she laughed sadly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that, dear,\u201d said Leonard in a sad voice; \u201cit pains me.\u201d\n\u201cHow else am I to talk after reading that letter?\u201d she answered, \u201cfor what woman can hold her own against a dead rival? Now also I must be indebted to her bounty all my days. Oh! if I had not lost the jewels\u2014if only I had not lost the jewels!\u201d\n\nHistory does not relate how Leonard dealt with this unexpected and yet natural situation. A week had passed and Leonard, with Juanna at his side, found himself once more in the great hall at Outram, where, on a bygone night, many years ago, he and his dead brother had sworn their oath. All was the same, for in this hall nothing had been changed\u2014Jane had seen to that. There chained to its stand was the Bible, upon which they had registered their vow; there were the pictures of his ancestors gazing down calmly upon him, as though they cared little for the story of his struggles and of his strange triumph over fortune \u201cby the help of a woman.\u201d There was the painted window, with its blazoned coats of arms and its proud mottoes\u2014\u201c_For Heart, Home, and Honour_,\u201d and \u201c_Per ardua ad astra_.\u201d He had won the heart and home, and he had kept his honour and his oath. He had endured the toils and dangers and the crown of stars was his.\n\nAnd yet, was Leonard altogether happy as he stood looking on these familiar things? Perhaps not quite, for yonder in the churchyard there was a grave, and within the church a monument in white marble, that was wonderfully like one who had loved him and whom he had loved, though time and trouble had written a strange difference on her face. Also, he had failed: he had kept his oath indeed and fought on till the end was won, but himself he had not won it. What now was his had once belonged to his successful rival, who doubtless little dreamed of the payment that would be exacted from him by the decree of fate.\n\nAnd was Juanna happy? She knew well that Leonard loved her truly; but oh! it was cruel that she who had shared the struggles should be deprived of her reward\u2014that it should be left to another, who if not false had at least been weak, to give to her husband that which she had striven so hard to win\u2014that which she had won\u2014and lost. And harder still was it that in this ancient place which would henceforth be her home, by day and by night she must feel the presence of the shadow of a woman, a woman sweet and pale, who, as she believed, stood between her and that which she desired above all things\u2014the complete and absolute possession of her husband\u2019s heart.\n\nDoubtless she overrated the trouble; men and women do not spend their lives in brooding upon the memories of their first loves\u2014if they did, this would be a melancholy world. But to Juanna it was real enough, and remained so for some years. And if a thing is true to the heart, it avails little that reason should give it the lie. In short, now in the hour of their full property, Leonard and Juanna were making acquaintance with the fact that fortune never gives with both hands, as the French say, but loves to rob with one while she bestows with the other. To few is it allowed to be completely miserable, to none to be completely happy. Their good luck had been so overwhelming in many ways, that it would have partaken of the unnatural, and might well have excited their fears for the future, had its completeness been unmarred by these drawbacks which, such as they were, probably they learned to disremember as the years passed over them bringing them new trials and added blessings."

  "Rafael Sabatini -- Captain Blood": [
    "There were, when the purple gloom of the tropical night descended upon the Caribbean, not more than ten men on guard aboard the Cinco Llagas, so confident--and with good reason--were the Spaniards of the complete subjection of the islanders. And when I say that there were ten men on guard, I state rather the purpose for which they were left aboard than the duty which they fulfilled. As a matter of fact, whilst the main body of the Spaniards feasted and rioted ashore, the Spanish gunner and his crew--who had so nobly done their duty and ensured the easy victory of the day--were feasting on the gun-deck upon the wine and the fresh meats fetched out to them from shore. Above, two sentinels only kept vigil, at stem and stern. Nor were they as vigilant as they should have been, or else they must have observed the two wherries that under cover of the darkness came gliding from the wharf, with well-greased rowlocks, to bring up in silence under the great ship's quarter.\n\nFrom the gallery aft still hung the ladder by which Don Diego had descended to the boat that had taken him ashore. The sentry on guard in the stern, coming presently round this gallery, was suddenly confronted by the black shadow of a man standing before him at the head of the ladder.\n\n\u201cWho's there?\u201d he asked, but without alarm, supposing it one of his fellows.\n\n\u201cIt is I,\u201d softly answered Peter Blood in the fluent Castillan of which he was master.\n\n\u201cIs it you, Pedro?\u201d The Spaniard came a step nearer.\n\n\u201cPeter is my name; but I doubt I'll not be the Peter you're expecting.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d quoth the sentry, checking.\n\n\u201cThis way,\u201d said Mr. Blood.\n\nThe wooden taffrail was a low one, and the Spaniard was taken completely by surprise. Save for the splash he made as he struck the water, narrowly missing one of the crowded boats that waited under the counter, not a sound announced his misadventure. Armed as he was with corselet, cuissarts, and headpiece, he sank to trouble them no more.\n\n\u201cWhist!\u201d hissed Mr. Blood to his waiting rebels-convict. \u201cCome on, now, and without noise.\u201d\n\nWithin five minutes they had swarmed aboard, the entire twenty of them overflowing from that narrow gallery and crouching on the quarter-deck itself. Lights showed ahead. Under the great lantern in the prow they saw the black figure of the other sentry, pacing on the forecastle. From below sounds reached them of the orgy on the gun-deck: a rich male voice was singing an obscene ballad to which the others chanted in chorus:\n\n\u201cY estos son los usos de Castilla y de Leon!\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom what I've seen to-day I can well believe it,\u201d said Mr. Blood, and whispered: \u201cForward--after me.\u201d\n\nCrouching low, they glided, noiseless as shadows, to the quarter-deck rail, and thence slipped without sound down into the waist. Two thirds of them were armed with muskets, some of which they had found in the overseer's house, and others supplied from the secret hoard that Mr. Blood had so laboriously assembled against the day of escape. The remainder were equipped with knives and cutlasses.\n\nIn the vessel's waist they hung awhile, until Mr. Blood had satisfied himself that no other sentinel showed above decks but that inconvenient fellow in the prow. Their first attention must be for him. Mr. Blood, himself, crept forward with two companions, leaving the others in the charge of that Nathaniel Hagthorpe whose sometime commission in the King's Navy gave him the best title to this office.\n\nMr. Blood's absence was brief. When he rejoined his comrades there was no watch above the Spaniards' decks.\n\nMeanwhile the revellers below continued to make merry at their ease in the conviction of complete security. The garrison of Barbados was overpowered and disarmed, and their companions were ashore in complete possession of the town, glutting themselves hideously upon the fruits of victory. What, then, was there to fear? Even when their quarters were invaded and they found themselves surrounded by a score of wild, hairy, half-naked men, who--save that they appeared once to have been white--looked like a horde of savages, the Spaniards could not believe their eyes.\n\nWho could have dreamed that a handful of forgotten plantation-slaves would have dared to take so much upon themselves?\n\nThe half-drunken Spaniards, their laughter suddenly quenched, the song perishing on their lips, stared, stricken and bewildered at the levelled muskets by which they were checkmated.\n\nAnd then, from out of this uncouth pack of savages that beset them, stepped a slim, tall fellow with light-blue eyes in a tawny face, eyes in which glinted the light of a wicked humour. He addressed them in the purest Castilian.\n\n\u201cYou will save yourselves pain and trouble by regarding yourselves my prisoners, and suffering yourselves to be quietly bestowed out of harm's way.\u201d\n\n\u201cName of God!\u201d swore the gunner, which did no justice at all to an amazement beyond expression.\n\n\u201cIf you please,\u201d said Mr. Blood, and thereupon those gentlemen of Spain were induced without further trouble beyond a musket prod or two to drop through a scuttle to the deck below.\n\nAfter that the rebels-convict refreshed themselves with the good things in the consumption of which they had interrupted the Spaniards. To taste palatable Christian food after months of salt fish and maize dumplings was in itself a feast to these unfortunates. But there were no excesses. Mr. Blood saw to that, although it required all the firmness of which he was capable.\n\nDispositions were to be made without delay against that which must follow before they could abandon themselves fully to the enjoyment of their victory. This, after all, was no more than a preliminary skirmish, although it was one that afforded them the key to the situation. It remained to dispose so that the utmost profit might be drawn from it. Those dispositions occupied some very considerable portion of the night. But, at least, they were complete before the sun peeped over the shoulder of Mount Hilibay to shed his light upon a day of some surprises.",
    "Don Diego de Espinosa y Valdez awoke, and with languid eyes in aching head, he looked round the cabin, which was flooded with sunlight from the square windows astern. Then he uttered a moan, and closed his eyes again, impelled to this by the monstrous ache in his head. Lying thus, he attempted to think, to locate himself in time and space. But between the pain in his head and the confusion in his mind, he found coherent thought impossible.\n\nAn indefinite sense of alarm drove him to open his eyes again, and once more to consider his surroundings.\n\nThere could be no doubt that he lay in the great cabin of his own ship, the Cinco Llagas, so that his vague disquiet must be, surely, ill-founded. And yet, stirrings of memory coming now to the assistance of reflection, compelled him uneasily to insist that here something was not as it should be. The low position of the sun, flooding the cabin with golden light from those square ports astern, suggested to him at first that it was early morning, on the assumption that the vessel was headed westward. Then the alternative occurred to him. They might be sailing eastward, in which case the time of day would be late afternoon. That they were sailing he could feel from the gentle forward heave of the vessel under him. But how did they come to be sailing, and he, the master, not to know whether their course lay east or west, not to be able to recollect whither they were bound?\n\nHis mind went back over the adventure of yesterday, if of yesterday it was. He was clear on the matter of the easily successful raid upon the Island of Barbados; every detail stood vividly in his memory up to the moment at which, returning aboard, he had stepped on to his own deck again. There memory abruptly and inexplicably ceased.\n\nHe was beginning to torture his mind with conjecture, when the door opened, and to Don Diego's increasing mystification he beheld his best suit of clothes step into the cabin. It was a singularly elegant and characteristically Spanish suit of black taffetas with silver lace that had been made for him a year ago in Cadiz, and he knew each detail of it so well that it was impossible he could now be mistaken.\n\nThe suit paused to close the door, then advanced towards the couch on which Don Diego was extended, and inside the suit came a tall, slender gentleman of about Don Diego's own height and shape. Seeing the wide, startled eyes of the Spaniard upon him, the gentleman lengthened his stride.\n\n\u201cAwake, eh?\u201d said he in Spanish.\n\nThe recumbent man looked up bewildered into a pair of light-blue eyes that regarded him out of a tawny, sardonic face set in a cluster of black ringlets. But he was too bewildered to make any answer.\n\nThe stranger's fingers touched the top of Don Diego's head, whereupon Don Diego winced and cried out in pain.\n\n\u201cTender, eh?\u201d said the stranger. He took Don Diego's wrist between thumb and second finger. And then, at last, the intrigued Spaniard spoke.\n\n\u201cAre you a doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong other things.\u201d The swarthy gentleman continued his study of the patient's pulse. \u201cFirm and regular,\u201d he announced at last, and dropped the wrist. \u201cYou've taken no great harm.\u201d\n\nDon Diego struggled up into a sitting position on the red velvet couch.\n\n\u201cWho the devil are you?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd what the devil are you doing in my clothes and aboard my ship?\u201d\n\nThe level black eyebrows went up, a faint smile curled the lips of the long mouth.\n\n\u201cYou are still delirious, I fear. This is not your ship. This is my ship, and these are my clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour ship?\u201d quoth the other, aghast, and still more aghast he added: \u201cYour clothes? But... then....\u201d Wildly his eyes looked about him. They scanned the cabin once again, scrutinizing each familiar object. \u201cAm I mad?\u201d he asked at last. \u201cSurely this ship is the Cinco Llagas?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cinco Llagas it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen....\u201d The Spaniard broke off. His glance grew still more troubled. \u201cValga me Dios!\u201d he cried out, like a man in anguish. \u201cWill you tell me also that you are Don Diego de Espinosa?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, my name is Blood--Captain Peter Blood. This ship, like this handsome suit of clothes, is mine by right of conquest. Just as you, Don Diego, are my prisoner.\u201d\n\nStartling as was the explanation, yet it proved soothing to Don Diego, being so much less startling than the things he was beginning to imagine.\n\n\u201cBut... Are you not Spanish, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou flatter my Castilian accent. I have the honour to be Irish. You were thinking that a miracle had happened. So it has--a miracle wrought by my genius, which is considerable.\u201d\n\nSuccinctly now Captain Blood dispelled the mystery by a relation of the facts. It was a narrative that painted red and white by turns the Spaniard's countenance. He put a hand to the back of his head, and there discovered, in confirmation of the story, a lump as large as a pigeon's egg. Lastly, he stared wild-eyed at the sardonic Captain Blood.\n\n\u201cAnd my son? What of my son?\u201d he cried out. \u201cHe was in the boat that brought me aboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour son is safe; he and the boat's crew together with your gunner and his men are snugly in irons under hatches.\u201d\n\nDon Diego sank back on the couch, his glittering dark eyes fixed upon the tawny face above him. He composed himself. After all, he possessed the stoicism proper to his desperate trade. The dice had fallen against him in this venture. The tables had been turned upon him in the very moment of success. He accepted the situation with the fortitude of a fatalist.\n\nWith the utmost calm he enquired:\n\n\u201cAnd now, Senior Capitan?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Captain Blood--to give him the title he had assumed--\u201cbeing a humane man, I am sorry to find that ye're not dead from the tap we gave you. For it means that you'll be put to the trouble of dying all over again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d Don Diego drew a deep breath. \u201cBut is that necessary?\u201d he asked, without apparent perturbation.\n\nCaptain Blood's blue eyes approved his bearing. \u201cAsk yourself,\u201d said he. \u201cTell me, as an experienced and bloody pirate, what in my place would you do, yourself?\u201d",
    "In the glory of the following morning, sparkling and clear after the storm, with an invigorating, briny tang in the air from the salt-ponds on the south of the island, a curious scene was played on the beach of the Virgen Magra, at the foot of a ridge of bleached dunes, beside the spread of sail from which Levasseur had improvised a tent.\n\nEnthroned upon an empty cask sat the French filibuster to transact important business: the business of making himself safe with the Governor of Tortuga.\n\nA guard of honour of a half-dozen officers hung about him; five of them were rude boucan-hunters, in stained jerkins and leather breeches; the sixth was Cahusac. Before him, guarded by two half-naked negroes, stood young d'Ogeron, in frilled shirt and satin small-clothes and fine shoes of Cordovan leather. He was stripped of doublet, and his hands were tied behind him. The young gentleman's comely face was haggard. Near at hand, and also under guard, but unpinioned, mademoiselle his sister sat hunched upon a hillock of sand. She was very pale, and it was in vain that she sought to veil in a mask of arrogance the fears by which she was assailed.\n\nLevasseur addressed himself to M. d'Ogeron. He spoke at long length. In the end--\n\n\u201cI trust, monsieur,\u201d said he, with mock suavity, \u201cthat I have made myself quite clear. So that there may be no misunderstandings, I will recapitulate. Your ransom is fixed at twenty thousand pieces of eight, and you shall have liberty on parole to go to Tortuga to collect it. In fact, I shall provide the means to convey you thither, and you shall have a month in which to come and go. Meanwhile, your sister remains with me as a hostage. Your father should not consider such a sum excessive as the price of his son's liberty and to provide a dowry for his daughter. Indeed, if anything, I am too modest, pardi! M. d'Ogeron is reputed a wealthy man.\u201d\n\nM. d'Ogeron the younger raised his head and looked the Captain boldly in the face.\n\n\u201cI refuse--utterly and absolutely, do you understand? So do your worst, and be damned for a filthy pirate without decency and without honour.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what words!\u201d laughed Levasseur. \u201cWhat heat and what foolishness! You have not considered the alternative. When you do, you will not persist in your refusal. You will not do that in any case. We have spurs for the reluctant. And I warn you against giving me your parole under stress, and afterwards playing me false. I shall know how to find and punish you. Meanwhile, remember your sister's honour is in pawn to me. Should you forget to return with the dowry, you will not consider it unreasonable that I forget to marry her.\u201d\n\nLevasseur's smiling eyes, intent upon the young man's face, saw the horror that crept into his glance. M. d'Ogeron cast a wild glance at mademoiselle, and observed the grey despair that had almost stamped the beauty from her face. Disgust and fury swept across his countenance.\n\nThen he braced himself and answered resolutely:\n\n\u201cNo, you dog! A thousand times, no!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are foolish to persist.\u201d Levasseur spoke without anger, with a coldly mocking regret. His fingers had been busy tying knots in a length of whipcord. He held it up. \u201cYou know this? It is a rosary of pain that has wrought the conversion of many a stubborn heretic. It is capable of screwing the eyes out of a man's head by way of helping him to see reason. As you please.\u201d\n\nHe flung the length of knotted cord to one of the negroes, who in an instant made it fast about the prisoner's brows. Then between cord and cranium the black inserted a short length of metal, round and slender as a pipe-stem. That done he rolled his eyes towards Levasseur, awaiting the Captain's signal.\n\nLevasseur considered his victim, and beheld him tense and braced, his haggard face of a leaden hue, beads of perspiration glinting on his pallid brow just beneath the whipcord.\n\nMademoiselle cried out, and would have risen: but her guards restrained her, and she sank down again, moaning.\n\n\u201cI beg that you will spare yourself and your sister,\u201d said the Captain, \u201cby being reasonable. What, after all, is the sum I have named? To your wealthy father a bagatelle. I repeat, I have been too modest. But since I have said twenty thousand pieces of eight, twenty thousand pieces it shall be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd for what, if you please, have you said twenty thousand pieces of eight?\u201d\n\nIn execrable French, but in a voice that was crisp and pleasant, seeming to echo some of the mockery that had invested Levasseur's, that question floated over their heads.\n\nStartled, Levasseur and his officers looked up and round. On the crest of the dunes behind them, in sharp silhouette against the deep cobalt of the sky, they beheld a tall, lean figure scrupulously dressed in black with silver lace, a crimson ostrich plume curled about the broad brim of his hat affording the only touch of colour. Under that hat was the tawny face of Captain Blood.\n\nLevasseur gathered himself up with an oath of amazement. He had conceived Captain Blood by now well below the horizon, on his way to Tortuga, assuming him to have been so fortunate as to have weathered last night's storm.\n\nLaunching himself upon the yielding sand, into which he sank to the level of the calves of his fine boots of Spanish leather, Captain Blood came sliding erect to the beach. He was followed by Wolverstone, and a dozen others. As he came to a standstill, he doffed his hat, with a flourish, to the lady. Then he turned to Levasseur."

  "H. Rider Haggard -- Allan Quatermain": [
    "December 23\n\n\u201cI have just buried my boy, my poor handsome boy of whom I was so proud, and my heart is broken. It is very hard having only one son to lose him thus, but God\u2019s will be done. Who am I that I should complain? The great wheel of Fate rolls on like a Juggernaut, and crushes us all in turn, some soon, some late\u2014it does not matter when, in the end, it crushes us all. We do not prostrate ourselves before it like the poor Indians; we fly hither and thither\u2014we cry for mercy; but it is of no use, the black Fate thunders on and in its season reduces us to powder. Poor Harry to go so soon! just when his life was opening to him. He was doing so well at the hospital, he had passed his last examination with honours, and I was proud of them, much prouder than he was, I think. And then he must needs go to that smallpox hospital. He wrote to me that he was not afraid of smallpox and wanted to gain the experience; and now the disease has killed him, and I, old and grey and withered, am left to mourn over him, without a chick or child to comfort me. I might have saved him, too\u2014I have money enough for both of us, and much more than enough\u2014King Solomon\u2019s Mines provided me with that; but I said, \u2018No, let the boy earn his living, let him labour that he may enjoy rest.\u2019 But the rest has come to him before the labour. Oh, my boy, my boy! I am like the man in the Bible who laid up much goods and builded barns\u2014goods for my boy and barns for him to store them in; and now his soul has been required of him, and I am left desolate. I would that it had been my soul and not my boy\u2019s! We buried him this afternoon under the shadow of the grey and ancient tower of the church of this village where my house is. It was a dreary December afternoon, and the sky was heavy with snow, but not much was falling. The coffin was put down by the grave, and a few big flakes lit upon it. They looked very white upon the black cloth! There was a little hitch about getting the coffin down into the grave\u2014the necessary ropes had been forgotten: so we drew back from it, and waited in silence watching the big flakes fall gently one by one like heavenly benedictions, and melt in tears on Harry\u2019s pall. But that was not all. A robin redbreast came as bold as could be and lit upon the coffin and began to sing. And then I am afraid that I broke down, and so did Sir Henry Curtis, strong man though he is; and as for Captain Good, I saw him turn away too; even in my own distress I could not help noticing it.\u201d\n\n\nThe above, signed \u201cAllan Quatermain\u201d, is an extract from my diary written two years and more ago. I copy it down here because it seems to me that it is the fittest beginning to the history that I am about to write, if it please God to spare me to finish it. If not, well it does not matter. That extract was penned seven thousand miles or so from the spot where I now lie painfully and slowly writing this, with a pretty girl standing by my side fanning the flies from my august countenance. Harry is there and I am here, and yet somehow I cannot help feeling that I am not far off Harry.\n\n\nWhen I was in England I used to live in a very fine house\u2014at least I call it a fine house, speaking comparatively, and judging from the standard of the houses I have been accustomed to all my life in Africa\u2014not five hundred yards from the old church where Harry is asleep, and thither I went after the funeral and ate some food; for it is no good starving even if one has just buried all one\u2019s earthly hopes. But I could not eat much, and soon I took to walking, or rather limping\u2014being permanently lame from the bite of a lion\u2014up and down, up and down the oak-panelled vestibule; for there is a vestibule in my house in England. On all the four walls of this vestibule were placed pairs of horns\u2014about a hundred pairs altogether, all of which I had shot myself. They are beautiful specimens, as I never keep any horns which are not in every way perfect, unless it may be now and again on account of the associations connected with them. In the centre of the room, however, over the wide fireplace, there was a clear space left on which I had fixed up all my rifles. Some of them I have had for forty years, old muzzle-loaders that nobody would look at nowadays. One was an elephant gun with strips of rimpi, or green hide, lashed round the stock and locks, such as used to be owned by the Dutchmen\u2014a \u201croer\u201d they call it. That gun, the Boer I bought it from many years ago told me, had been used by his father at the battle of the Blood River, just after Dingaan swept into Natal and slaughtered six hundred men, women, and children, so that the Boers named the place where they died \u201cWeenen\u201d, or the \u201cPlace of Weeping\u201d; and so it is called to this day, and always will be called. And many an elephant have I shot with that old gun. She always took a handful of black powder and a three-ounce ball, and kicked like the very deuce.\n\n\nWell, up and down I walked, staring at the guns and the horns which the guns had brought low; and as I did so there rose up in me a great craving:\u2014I would go away from this place where I lived idly and at ease, back again to the wild land where I had spent my life, where I met my dear wife and poor Harry was born, and so many things, good, bad, and indifferent, had happened to me. The thirst for the wilderness was on me; I could tolerate this place no more; I would go and die as I had lived, among the wild game and the savages. Yes, as I walked, I began to long to see the moonlight gleaming silvery white over the wide veldt and mysterious sea of bush, and watch the lines of game travelling down the ridges to the water. The ruling passion is strong in death, they say, and my heart was dead that night. But, independently of my trouble, no man who has for forty years lived the life I have, can with impunity go coop himself in this prim English country, with its trim hedgerows and cultivated fields, its stiff formal manners, and its well-dressed crowds. He begins to long\u2014ah, how he longs!\u2014for the keen breath of the desert air; he dreams of the sight of Zulu impis breaking on their foes like surf upon the rocks, and his heart rises up in rebellion against the strict limits of the civilized life.\n\n\nAh! this civilization, what does it all come to? For forty years and more I lived among savages, and studied them and their ways; and now for several years I have lived here in England, and have in my own stupid manner done my best to learn the ways of the children of light; and what have I found? A great gulf fixed? No, only a very little one, that a plain man\u2019s thought may spring across. I say that as the savage is, so is the white man, only the latter is more inventive, and possesses the faculty of combination; save and except also that the savage, as I have known him, is to a large extent free from the greed of money, which eats like a cancer into the heart of the white man. It is a depressing conclusion, but in all essentials the savage and the child of civilization are identical.\n\n\nI dare say that the highly civilized lady reading this will smile at an old fool of a hunter\u2019s simplicity when she thinks of her black bead-bedecked sister; and so will the superfine cultured idler scientifically eating a dinner at his club, the cost of which would keep a starving family for a week. And yet, my dear young lady, what are those pretty things round your own neck?\u2014they have a strong family resemblance, especially when you wear that _very_ low dress, to the savage woman\u2019s beads. Your habit of turning round and round to the sound of horns and tom-toms, your fondness for pigments and powders, the way in which you love to subjugate yourself to the rich warrior who has captured you in marriage, and the quickness with which your taste in feathered head-dresses varies\u2014all these things suggest touches of kinship; and you remember that in the fundamental principles of your nature you are quite identical. As for you, sir, who also laugh, let some man come and strike you in the face whilst you are enjoying that marvellous-looking dish, and we shall soon see how much of the savage there is in _you_.\n\n\nThere, I might go on for ever, but what is the good? Civilization is only savagery silver-gilt. A vainglory is it, and like a northern light, comes but to fade and leave the sky more dark. Out of the soil of barbarism it has grown like a tree, and, as I believe, into the soil like a tree it will once more, sooner or later, fall again, as the Egyptian civilization fell, as the Hellenic civilization fell, and as the Roman civilization and many others of which the world has now lost count, fell also. Do not let me, however, be understood as decrying our modern institutions, representing as they do the gathered experience of humanity applied for the good of all. Of course they have great advantages\u2014hospitals for instance; but then, remember, we breed the sickly people who fill them. In a savage land they do not exist. Besides, the question will arise: How many of these blessings are due to Christianity as distinct from civilization? And so the balance sways and the story runs\u2014here a gain, there a loss, and Nature\u2019s great average struck across the two, whereof the sum total forms one of the factors in that mighty equation in which the result will equal the unknown quantity of her purpose.\n\n\nI make no apology for this digression, especially as this is an introduction which all young people and those who never like to think (and it is a bad habit) will naturally skip. It seems to me very desirable that we should sometimes try to understand the limitations of our nature, so that we may not be carried away by the pride of knowledge. Man\u2019s cleverness is almost indefinite, and stretches like an elastic band, but human nature is like an iron ring. You can go round and round it, you can polish it highly, you can even flatten it a little on one side, whereby you will make it bulge out the other, but you will _never_, while the world endures and man is man, increase its total circumference. It is the one fixed unchangeable thing\u2014fixed as the stars, more enduring than the mountains, as unalterable as the way of the Eternal. Human nature is God\u2019s kaleidoscope, and the little bits of coloured glass which represent our passions, hopes, fears, joys, aspirations towards good and evil and what not, are turned in His mighty hand as surely and as certainly as it turns the stars, and continually fall into new patterns and combinations. But the composing elements remain the same, nor will there be one more bit of coloured glass nor one less for ever and ever.\n\n\nThis being so, supposing for the sake of argument we divide ourselves into twenty parts, nineteen savage and one civilized, we must look to the nineteen savage portions of our nature, if we would really understand ourselves, and not to the twentieth, which, though so insignificant in reality, is spread all over the other nineteen, making them appear quite different from what they really are, as the blacking does a boot, or the veneer a table. It is on the nineteen rough serviceable savage portions that we fall back in emergencies, not on the polished but unsubstantial twentieth. Civilization should wipe away our tears, and yet we weep and cannot be comforted. Warfare is abhorrent to her, and yet we strike out for hearth and home, for honour and fair fame, and can glory in the blow. And so on, through everything.\n\n\nSo, when the heart is stricken, and the head is humbled in the dust, civilization fails us utterly. Back, back, we creep, and lay us like little children on the great breast of Nature, she that perchance may soothe us and make us forget, or at least rid remembrance of its sting. Who has not in his great grief felt a longing to look upon the outward features of the universal Mother; to lie on the mountains and watch the clouds drive across the sky and hear the rollers break in thunder on the shore, to let his poor struggling life mingle for a while in her life; to feel the slow beat of her eternal heart, and to forget his woes, and let his identity be swallowed in the vast imperceptibly moving energy of her of whom we are, from whom we came, and with whom we shall again be mingled, who gave us birth, and will in a day to come give us our burial also.\n\n\nAnd so in my trouble, as I walked up and down the oak-panelled vestibule of my house there in Yorkshire, I longed once more to throw myself into the arms of Nature. Not the Nature which you know, the Nature that waves in well-kept woods and smiles out in corn-fields, but Nature as she was in the age when creation was complete, undefiled as yet by any human sinks of sweltering humanity. I would go again where the wild game was, back to the land whereof none know the history, back to the savages, whom I love, although some of them are almost as merciless as Political Economy. There, perhaps, I should be able to learn to think of poor Harry lying in the churchyard, without feeling as though my heart would break in two.\n\n\nAnd now there is an end of this egotistical talk, and there shall be no more of it. But if you whose eyes may perchance one day fall upon my written thoughts have got so far as this, I ask you to persevere, since what I have to tell you is not without its interest, and it has never been told before, nor will again.",
    "Three days after our start an ominous incident occurred. We were just drawing in to the bank to make our camp as usual for the night, when we caught sight of a figure standing on a little knoll not forty yards away, and intensely watching our approach. One glance was sufficient\u2014although I was personally unacquainted with the tribe\u2014to tell me that he was a Masai Elmoran, or young warrior. Indeed, had I had any doubts, they would have quickly been dispelled by the terrified ejaculation of \u201c_Masai!_\u201d that burst simultaneously from the lips of our Wakwafi followers, who are, as I think I have said, themselves bastard Masai.\n\n\nAnd what a figure he presented as he stood there in his savage war-gear! Accustomed as I have been to savages all my life, I do not think that I have ever before seen anything quite so ferocious or awe-inspiring. To begin with, the man was enormously tall, quite as tall as Umslopogaas, I should say, and beautifully, though somewhat slightly, shaped; but with the face of a devil. In his right hand he held a spear about five and a half feet long, the blade being two and a half feet in length, by nearly three inches in width, and having an iron spike at the end of the handle that measured more than a foot. On his left arm was a large and well-made elliptical shield of buffalo hide, on which were painted strange heraldic-looking devices. On his shoulders was a huge cape of hawk\u2019s feathers, and round his neck was a \u201cnaibere\u201d, or strip of cotton, about seventeen feet long, by one and a half broad, with a stripe of colour running down the middle of it. The tanned goatskin robe, which formed his ordinary attire in times of peace, was tied lightly round his waist, so as to serve the purposes of a belt, and through it were stuck, on the right and left sides respectively, his short pear-shaped sime, or sword, which is made of a single piece of steel, and carried in a wooden sheath, and an enormous knobkerrie. But perhaps the most remarkable feature of his attire consisted of a headdress of ostrich-feathers, which was fixed on the chin, and passed in front of the ears to the forehead, and, being shaped like an ellipse, completely framed the face, so that the diabolical countenance appeared to project from a sort of feather fire-screen. Round the ankles he wore black fringes of hair, and, projecting from the upper portion of the calves, to which they were attached, were long spurs like spikes, from which flowed down tufts of the beautiful black and waving hair of the Colobus monkey. Such was the elaborate array of the Masai Elmoran who stood watching the approach of our two canoes, but it is one which, to be appreciated, must be seen; only those who see it do not often live to describe it. Of course I could not make out all these details of his full dress on the occasion of this my first introduction, being, indeed, amply taken up with the consideration of the general effect, but I had plenty of subsequent opportunities of becoming acquainted with the items that went to make it up.\n\n\nWhilst we were hesitating what to do, the Masai warrior drew himself up in a dignified fashion, shook his huge spear at us, and, turning, vanished on the further side of the slope.\n\n\n\u201cHulloa!\u201d holloaed Sir Henry from the other boat; \u201cour friend the caravan leader has been as good as his word, and set the Masai after us. Do you think it will be safe to go ashore?\u201d\n\n\nI did not think it would be at all safe; but, on the other hand, we had no means of cooking in the canoes, and nothing that we could eat raw, so it was difficult to know what to do. At last Umslopogaas simplified matters by volunteering to go and reconnoitre, which he did, creeping off into the bush like a snake, while we hung off in the stream waiting for him. In half an hour he returned, and told us that there was not a Masai to be seen anywhere about, but that he had discovered a spot where they had recently been encamped, and that from various indications he judged that they must have moved on an hour or so before; the man we saw having, no doubt, been left to report upon our movements.\n\n\nThereupon we landed; and, having posted a sentry, proceeded to cook and eat our evening meal. This done, we took the situation into our serious consideration. Of course, it was possible that the apparition of the Masai warrior had nothing to do with us, that he was merely one of a band bent upon some marauding and murdering expedition against another tribe. But when we recalled the threat of the caravan leader, and reflected on the ominous way in which the warrior had shaken his spear at us, this did not appear very probable. On the contrary, what did seem probable was that the party was after us and awaiting a favourable opportunity to attack us. This being so, there were two things that we could do\u2014one of which was to go on, and the other to go back. The latter idea was, however, rejected at once, it being obvious that we should encounter as many dangers in retreat as in advance; and, besides, we had made up our minds to journey onwards at any price. Under these circumstances, however, we did not consider it safe to sleep ashore, so we got into our canoes, and, paddling out into the middle of the stream, which was not very wide here, managed to anchor them by means of big stones fastened to ropes made of coconut-fibre, of which there were several fathoms in each canoe.\n\n\nHere the mosquitoes nearly ate us up alive, and this, combined with anxiety as to our position, effectually prevented me from sleeping as the others were doing, notwithstanding the attacks of the aforesaid Tana mosquitoes. And so I lay awake, smoking and reflecting on many things, but, being of a practical turn of mind, chiefly on how we were to give those Masai villains the slip. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and, notwithstanding the mosquitoes, and the great risk we were running from fever from sleeping in such a spot, and forgetting that I had the cramp very badly in my right leg from squatting in a constrained position in the canoe, and that the Wakwafi who was sleeping beside me smelt horribly, I really began to enjoy myself. The moonbeams played upon the surface of the running water that speeded unceasingly past us towards the sea, like men\u2019s lives towards the grave, till it glittered like a wide sheet of silver, that is in the open where the trees threw no shadows. Near the banks, however, it was very dark, and the night wind sighed sadly in the reeds. To our left, on the further side of the river, was a little sandy bay which was clear of trees, and here I could make out the forms of numerous antelopes advancing to the water, till suddenly there came an ominous roar, whereupon they all made off hurriedly. Then after a pause I caught sight of the massive form of His Majesty the Lion, coming down to drink his fill after meat. Presently he moved on, then came a crashing of the reeds about fifty yards above us, and a few minutes later a huge black mass rose out of the water, about twenty yards from me, and snorted. It was the head of a hippopotamus. Down it went without a sound, only to rise again within five yards of where I sat. This was decidedly too near to be comfortable, more especially as the hippopotamus was evidently animated by intense curiosity to know what on earth our canoes were. He opened his great mouth, to yawn, I suppose, and gave me an excellent view of his ivories; and I could not help reflecting how easily he could crunch up our frail canoe with a single bite. Indeed, I had half a mind to give him a ball from my eight-bore, but on reflection determined to let him alone unless he actually charged the boat. Presently he sank again as noiselessly as before, and I saw no more of him. Just then, on looking towards the bank on our right, I fancied that I caught sight of a dark figure flitting between the tree trunks. I have very keen sight, and I was almost sure that I saw something, but whether it was bird, beast, or man I could not say. At the moment, however, a dark cloud passed over the moon, and I saw no more of it. Just then, too, although all the other sounds of the forest had ceased, a species of horned owl with which I was well acquainted began to hoot with great persistency. After that, save for the rustling of trees and reeds when the wind caught them, there was complete silence.\n\n\nBut somehow, in the most unaccountable way, I had suddenly become nervous. There was no particular reason why I should be, beyond the ordinary reasons which surround the Central African traveller, and yet I undoubtedly was. If there is one thing more than another of which I have the most complete and entire scorn and disbelief, it is of presentiments, and yet here I was all of a sudden filled with and possessed by a most undoubted presentiment of approaching evil. I would not give way to it, however, although I felt the cold perspiration stand out upon my forehead. I would not arouse the others. Worse and worse I grew, my pulse fluttered like a dying man\u2019s, my nerves thrilled with the horrible sense of impotent terror which anybody who is subject to nightmare will be familiar with, but still my will triumphed over my fears, and I lay quiet (for I was half sitting, half lying, in the bow of the canoe), only turning my face so as to command a view of Umslopogaas and the two Wakwafi who were sleeping alongside of and beyond me.\n\n\nIn the distance I heard a hippopotamus splash faintly, then the owl hooted again in a kind of unnatural screaming note, and the wind began to moan plaintively through the trees, making a heart-chilling music. Above was the black bosom of the cloud, and beneath me swept the black flood of the water, and I felt as though I and Death were utterly alone between them. It was very desolate.",
    "After dinner we thoroughly inspected all the outbuildings and grounds of the station, which I consider the most successful as well as the most beautiful place of the sort that I have seen in Africa. We then returned to the veranda, where we found Umslopogaas taking advantage of this favourable opportunity to clean all the rifles thoroughly. This was the only _work_ that he ever did or was asked to do, for as a Zulu chief it was beneath his dignity to work with his hands; but such as it was he did it very well. It was a curious sight to see the great Zulu sitting there upon the floor, his battleaxe resting against the wall behind him, whilst his long aristocratic-looking hands were busily employed, delicately and with the utmost care, cleaning the mechanism of the breech-loaders. He had a name for each gun. One\u2014a double four-bore belonging to Sir Henry\u2014was the Thunderer; another, my 500 Express, which had a peculiarly sharp report, was \u201cthe little one who spoke like a whip\u201d; the Winchester repeaters were \u201cthe women, who talked so fast that you could not tell one word from another\u201d; the six Martinis were \u201cthe common people\u201d; and so on with them all. It was very curious to hear him addressing each gun as he cleaned it, as though it were an individual, and in a vein of the quaintest humour. He did the same with his battleaxe, which he seemed to look upon as an intimate friend, and to which he would at times talk by the hour, going over all his old adventures with it\u2014and dreadful enough some of them were. By a piece of grim humour, he had named this axe \u201cInkosi-kaas\u201d, which is the Zulu word for chieftainess. For a long while I could not make out why he gave it such a name, and at last I asked him, when he informed me that the axe was very evidently feminine, because of her womanly habit of prying very deep into things, and that she was clearly a chieftainess because all men fell down before her, struck dumb at the sight of her beauty and power. In the same way he would consult \u201cInkosi-kaas\u201d if in any dilemma; and when I asked him why he did so, he informed me it was because she must needs be wise, having \u201clooked into so many people\u2019s brains\u201d.\n\n\nI took up the axe and closely examined this formidable weapon. It was, as I have said, of the nature of a pole-axe. The haft, made out of an enormous rhinoceros horn, was three feet three inches long, about an inch and a quarter thick, and with a knob at the end as large as a Maltese orange, left there to prevent the hand from slipping. This horn haft, though so massive, was as flexible as cane, and practically unbreakable; but, to make assurance doubly sure, it was whipped round at intervals of a few inches with copper wire\u2014all the parts where the hands grip being thus treated. Just above where the haft entered the head were scored a number of little nicks, each nick representing a man killed in battle with the weapon. The axe itself was made of the most beautiful steel, and apparently of European manufacture, though Umslopogaas did not know where it came from, having taken it from the hand of a chief he had killed in battle many years before. It was not very heavy, the head weighing two and a half pounds, as nearly as I could judge. The cutting part was slightly concave in shape\u2014not convex, as is generally the case with savage battle-axes\u2014and sharp as a razor, measuring five and three-quarter inches across the widest part. From the back of the axe sprang a stout spike four inches long, for the last two of which it was hollow, and shaped like a leather punch, with an opening for anything forced into the hollow at the punch end to be pushed out above\u2014in fact, in this respect it exactly resembled a butcher\u2019s pole-axe. It was with this punch end, as we afterwards discovered, that Umslopogaas usually struck when fighting, driving a neat round hole in his adversary\u2019s skull, and only using the broad cutting edge for a circular sweep, or sometimes in a _m\u00eal\u00e9e_. I think he considered the punch a neater and more sportsmanlike tool, and it was from his habit of pecking at his enemy with it that he got his name of \u201cWoodpecker\u201d. Certainly in his hands it was a terribly efficient one.\n\n\nSuch was Umslopogaas\u2019 axe, Inkosi-kaas, the most remarkable and fatal hand-to-hand weapon that I ever saw, and one which he cherished as much as his own life. It scarcely ever left his hand except when he was eating, and then he always sat with it under his leg.\n\n\nJust as I returned his axe to Umslopogaas, Miss Flossie came up and took me off to see her collection of flowers, African liliums, and blooming shrubs, some of which are very beautiful, many of the varieties being quite unknown to me and also, I believe, to botanical science. I asked her if she had ever seen or heard of the \u201cGoya\u201d lily, which Central African explorers have told me they have occasionally met with and whose wonderful loveliness has filled them with astonishment. This lily, which the natives say blooms only once in ten years, flourishes in the most arid soil. Compared to the size of the bloom, the bulb is small, generally weighing about four pounds. As for the flower itself (which I afterwards saw under circumstances likely to impress its appearance fixedly in my mind), I know not how to describe its beauty and splendour, or the indescribable sweetness of its perfume. The flower\u2014for it has only one bloom\u2014rises from the crown of the bulb on a thick fleshy and flat-sided stem, the specimen that I saw measured fourteen inches in diameter, and is somewhat trumpet-shaped like the bloom of an ordinary \u201clongiflorum\u201d set vertically. First there is the green sheath, which in its early stage is not unlike that of a water-lily, but which as the bloom opens splits into four portions and curls back gracefully towards the stem. Then comes the bloom itself, a single dazzling arch of white enclosing another cup of richest velvety crimson, from the heart of which rises a golden-coloured pistil. I have never seen anything to equal this bloom in beauty or fragrance, and as I believe it is but little known, I take the liberty to describe it at length. Looking at it for the first time I well remember that I realised how even in a flower there dwells something of the majesty of its Maker. To my great delight Miss Flossie told me that she knew the flower well and had tried to grow it in her garden, but without success, adding, however, that as it should be in bloom at this time of the year she thought that she could procure me a specimen.\n\n\nAfter that I fell to asking her if she was not lonely up here among all these savage people and without any companions of her own age. \u201cLonely?\u201d she said. \u201cOh, indeed no! I am as happy as the day is long, and besides I have my own companions. Why, I should hate to be buried in a crowd of white girls all just like myself so that nobody could tell the difference! Here,\u201d she said, giving her head a little toss, \u201cI am _I;_ and every native for miles around knows the \u2018Water-lily\u2019,\u2014for that is what they call me\u2014and is ready to do what I want, but in the books that I have read about little girls in England it is not like that. Everybody thinks them a trouble, and they have to do what their schoolmistress likes. Oh! it would break my heart to be put in a cage like that and not to be free\u2014free as the air.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWould you not like to learn?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cSo I do learn. Father teaches me Latin and French and arithmetic.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd are you never afraid among all these wild men?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAfraid? Oh no! they never interfere with me. I think they believe that I am \u2018Ngai\u2019 (of the Divinity) because I am so white and have fair hair. And look here,\u201d and diving her little hand into the bodice of her dress she produced a double-barrelled nickel-plated Derringer, \u201cI always carry that loaded, and if anybody tried to touch me I should shoot him. Once I shot a leopard that jumped upon my donkey as I was riding along. It frightened me very much, but I shot it in the ear and it fell dead, and I have its skin upon my bed. Look there!\u201d she went on in an altered voice, touching me on the arm and pointing to some far-away object, \u201cI said just now that I had companions; there is one of them.\u201d",
    "The cattle kraal where the Masai were camped lay at the foot of the hill on which the house stood, or, roughly speaking, about eight hundred yards from the Mission buildings. The first five hundred yards of this distance we traversed quietly indeed, but at a good pace; after that we crept forward as silently as a leopard on his prey, gliding like ghosts from bush to bush and stone to stone. When I had gone a little way I chanced to look behind me, and saw the redoubtable Alphonse staggering along with white face and trembling knees, and his rifle, which was at full cock, pointed directly at the small of my back. Having halted and carefully put the rifle at \u201csafety\u201d, we started again, and all went well till we were within one hundred yards or so of the kraal, when his teeth began to chatter in the most aggressive way.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop that I will kill you,\u201d I whispered savagely; for the idea of having all our lives sacrificed to a tooth-chattering cook was too much for me. I began to fear that he would betray us, and heartily wished we had left him behind.\n\n\u201cBut, monsieur, I cannot help it,\u201d he answered, \u201cit is the cold.\u201d\n\nHere was a dilemma, but fortunately I devised a plan. In the pocket of the coat I had on was a small piece of dirty rag that I had used some time before to clean a gun with. \u201cPut this in your mouth,\u201d I whispered again, giving him the rag; \u201cand if I hear another sound you are a dead man.\u201d I knew that that would stifle the clatter of his teeth. I must have looked as if I meant what I said, for he instantly obeyed me, and continued his journey in silence.\n\nThen we crept on again.\n\nAt last we were within fifty yards of the kraal. Between us and it was an open space of sloping grass with only one mimosa bush and a couple of tussocks of a sort of thistle for cover. We were still hidden in fairly thick bush. It was beginning to grow light. The stars had paled and a sickly gleam played about the east and was reflected on the earth. We could see the outline of the kraal clearly enough, and could also make out the faint glimmer of the dying embers of the Masai camp-fires. We halted and watched, for the sentry we knew was posted at the opening. Presently he appeared, a fine tall fellow, walking idly up and down within five paces of the thorn-stopped entrance. We had hoped to catch him napping, but it was not to be. He seemed particularly wide awake. If we could not kill that man, and kill him silently, we were lost. There we crouched and watched him. Presently Umslopogaas, who was a few paces ahead of me, turned and made a sign, and next second I saw him go down on his stomach like a snake, and, taking an opportunity when the sentry\u2019s head was turned, begin to work his way through the grass without a sound.\n\nThe unconscious sentry commenced to hum a little tune, and Umslopogaas crept on. He reached the shelter of the mimosa bush unperceived and there waited. Still the sentry walked up and down. Presently he turned and looked over the wall into the camp. Instantly the human snake who was stalking him glided on ten yards and got behind one of the tussocks of the thistle-like plant, reaching it as the Elmoran turned again. As he did so his eye fell upon this patch of thistles, and it seemed to strike him that it did not look quite right. He advanced a pace towards it\u2014halted, yawned, stooped down, picked up a little pebble and threw it at it. It hit Umslopogaas upon the head, luckily not upon the armour shirt. Had it done so the clink would have betrayed us. Luckily, too, the shirt was browned and not bright steel, which would certainly have been detected. Apparently satisfied that there was nothing wrong, he then gave over his investigations and contented himself with leaning on his spear and standing gazing idly at the tuft. For at least three minutes did he stand thus, plunged apparently in a gentle reverie, and there we lay in the last extremity of anxiety, expecting every moment that we should be discovered or that some untoward accident would happen. I could hear Alphonse\u2019s teeth going like anything on the oiled rag, and turning my head round made an awful face at him. But I am bound to state that my own heart was at much the same game as the Frenchman\u2019s castanets, while the perspiration was pouring from my body, causing the wash-leather-lined shirt to stick to me unpleasantly, and altogether I was in the pitiable state known by schoolboys as a \u201cblue fright\u201d.\n\nAt last the ordeal came to an end. The sentry glanced at the east, and appeared to note with satisfaction that his period of duty was coming to an end\u2014as indeed it was, once and for all\u2014for he rubbed his hands and began to walk again briskly to warm himself.\n\nThe moment his back was turned the long black snake glided on again, and reached the other thistle tuft, which was within a couple of paces of his return beat.\n\nBack came the sentry and strolled right past the tuft, utterly unconscious of the presence that was crouching behind it. Had he looked down he could scarcely have failed to see, but he did not do so.\n\nHe passed, and then his hidden enemy erected himself, and with outstretched hand followed in his tracks.\n\nA moment more, and, just as the Elmoran was about to turn, the great Zulu made a spring, and in the growing light we could see his long lean hands close round the Masai\u2019s throat. Then followed a convulsive twining of the two dark bodies, and in another second I saw the Masai\u2019s head bent back, and heard a sharp crack, something like that of a dry twig snapping, and he fell down upon the ground, his limbs moving spasmodically.\n\nUmslopogaas had put out all his iron strength and broken the warrior\u2019s neck.\n\nFor a moment he knelt upon his victim, still gripping his throat till he was sure that there was nothing more to fear from him, and then he rose and beckoned to us to advance, which we did on all fours, like a colony of huge apes. On reaching the kraal we saw that the Masai had still further choked this entrance, which was about ten feet wide\u2014no doubt in order to guard against attack\u2014by dragging four or five tops of mimosa trees up to it. So much the better for us, I reflected; the more obstruction there was the slower would they be able to come through. Here we separated; Mackenzie and his party creeping up under the shadow of the wall to the left, while Sir Henry and Umslopogaas took their stations one on each side of the thorn fence, the two spearmen and the Askari lying down in front of it. I and my men crept on up the right side of the kraal, which was about fifty paces long.\n\nWhen I was two-thirds up I halted, and placed my men at distances of four paces from one another, keeping Alphonse close to me, however. Then I peeped for the first time over the wall. It was getting fairly light now, and the first thing I saw was the white donkey, exactly opposite to me, and close by it I could make out the pale face of little Flossie, who was sitting as the lad had described, some ten paces from the wall. Round her lay many warriors, sleeping. At distances all over the surface of the kraal were the remains of fires, round each of which slept some five-and-twenty Masai, for the most part gorged with food. Now and then a man would raise himself, yawn, and look at the east, which was turning primrose; but none got up. I determined to wait another five minutes, both to allow the light to increase, so that we could make better shooting, and to give Good and his party\u2014of whom we could see or hear nothing\u2014every opportunity to make ready.\n\n\nThe quiet dawn began to throw her ever-widening mantle over plain and forest and river\u2014mighty Kenia, wrapped in the silence of eternal snows, looked out across the earth\u2014till presently a beam from the unrisen sun lit upon his heaven-kissing crest and purpled it with blood; the sky above grew blue, and tender as a mother\u2019s smile; a bird began to pipe his morning song, and a little breeze passing through the bush shook down the dewdrops in millions to refresh the waking world. Everywhere was peace and the happiness of arising strength, everywhere save in the heart of cruel man!\n\nSuddenly, just as I was nerving myself for the signal, having already selected my man on whom I meant to open fire\u2014a great fellow sprawling on the ground within three feet of little Flossie\u2014Alphonse\u2019s teeth began to chatter again like the hoofs of a galloping giraffe, making a great noise in the silence. The rag had dropped out in the agitation of his mind. Instantly a Masai within three paces of us woke, and, sitting up, gazed about him, looking for the cause of the sound. Moved beyond myself, I brought the butt-end of my rifle down on to the pit of the Frenchman\u2019s stomach. This stopped his chattering; but, as he doubled up, he managed to let off his gun in such a manner that the bullet passed within an inch of my head.\n\nThere was no need for a signal now. From both sides of the kraal broke out a waving line of fire, in which I myself joined, managing with a snap shot to knock over my Masai by Flossie, just as he was jumping up. Then from the top end of the kraal there rang an awful yell, in which I rejoiced to recognize Good\u2019s piercing notes rising clear and shrill above the din, and in another second followed such a scene as I have never seen before nor shall again. With an universal howl of terror and fury the brawny crowd of savages within the kraal sprang to their feet, many of them to fall again beneath our well-directed hail of lead before they had moved a yard. For a moment they stood undecided, and then hearing the cries and curses that rose unceasingly from the top end of the kraal, and bewildered by the storm of bullets, they as by one impulse rushed down towards the thorn-stopped entrance. As they went we kept pouring our fire with terrible effect into the thickening mob as fast as we could load. I had emptied my repeater of the ten shots it contained and was just beginning to slip in some more when I bethought me of little Flossie. Looking up, I saw that the white donkey was lying kicking, having been knocked over either by one of our bullets or a Masai spear-thrust. There were no living Masai near, but the black nurse was on her feet and with a spear cutting the rope that bound Flossie\u2019s feet. Next second she ran to the wall of the kraal and began to climb over it, an example which the little girl followed. But Flossie was evidently very stiff and cramped, and could only go slowly, and as she went two Masai flying down the kraal caught sight of her and rushed towards her to kill her. The first fellow came up just as the poor little girl, after a desperate effort to climb the wall, fell back into the kraal. Up flashed the great spear, and as it did so a bullet from my rifle found its home in the holder\u2019s ribs, and over he went like a shot rabbit. But behind him was the other man, and, alas, I had only that one cartridge in the magazine! Flossie had scrambled to her feet and was facing the second man, who was advancing with raised spear. I turned my head aside and felt sick as death. I could not bear to see him stab her. Glancing up again, to my surprise I saw the Masai\u2019s spear lying on the ground, while the man himself was staggering about with both hands to his head. Suddenly I saw a puff of smoke proceeding apparently from Flossie, and the man fell down headlong. Then I remembered the Derringer pistol she carried, and saw that she had fired both barrels of it at him, thereby saving her life. In another instant she had made an effort, and assisted by the nurse, who was lying on the top, had scrambled over the wall, and I knew that she was, comparatively speaking, safe.",
    "It was nearly midday when we made our dive into darkness, and we had set our watch (Good and Umslopogaas) at two, having agreed that it should be of a duration of five hours. At seven o\u2019clock, accordingly, Sir Henry and I went on, Sir Henry at the bow and I at the stern, and the other two lay down and went to sleep. For three hours all went well, Sir Henry only finding it necessary once to push us off from the side; and I that but little steering was required to keep us straight, as the violent current did all that was needed, though occasionally the canoe showed a tendency which had to be guarded against to veer and travel broadside on. What struck me as the most curious thing about this wonderful river was: how did the air keep fresh? It was muggy and thick, no doubt, but still not sufficiently so to render it bad or even remarkably unpleasant. The only explanation that I can suggest is that the water of the lake had sufficient air in it to keep the atmosphere of the tunnel from absolute stagnation, this air being given out as it proceeded on its headlong way. Of course I only give the solution of the mystery for what it is worth, which perhaps is not much.\n\nWhen I had been for three hours or so at the helm, I began to notice a decided change in the temperature, which was getting warmer. At first I took no notice of it, but when, at the expiration of another half-hour, I found that it was getting hotter and hotter, I called to Sir Henry and asked him if he noticed it, or if it was only my imagination. \u201cNoticed it!\u201d he answered; \u201cI should think so. I am in a sort of Turkish bath.\u201d Just about then the others woke up gasping, and were obliged to begin to discard their clothes. Here Umslopogaas had the advantage, for he did not wear any to speak of, except a moocha.\n\nHotter it grew, and hotter yet, till at last we could scarcely breathe, and the perspiration poured out of us. Half an hour more, and though we were all now stark naked, we could hardly bear it. The place was like an antechamber of the infernal regions proper. I dipped my hand into the water and drew it out almost with a cry; it was nearly boiling. We consulted a little thermometer we had\u2014the mercury stood at 123 degrees. From the surface of the water rose a dense cloud of steam. Alphonse groaned out that we were already in purgatory, which indeed we were, though not in the sense that he meant it. Sir Henry suggested that we must be passing near the seat of some underground volcanic fire, and I am inclined to think, especially in the light of what subsequently occurred, that he was right. Our sufferings for some time after this really pass my powers of description. We no longer perspired, for all the perspiration had been sweated out of us. We simply lay in the bottom of the boat, which we were now physically incapable of directing, feeling like hot embers, and I fancy undergoing very much the same sensations that the poor fish do when they are dying on land\u2014namely, that of slow suffocation. Our skins began to crack, and the blood to throb in our heads like the beating of a steam-engine.\n\nThis had been going on for some time, when suddenly the river turned a little, and I heard Sir Henry call out from the bows in a hoarse, startled voice, and, looking up, saw a most wonderful and awful thing. About half a mile ahead of us, and a little to the left of the centre of the stream\u2014which we could now see was about ninety feet broad\u2014a huge pillar-like jet of almost white flame rose from the surface of the water and sprang fifty feet into the air, when it struck the roof and spread out some forty feet in diameter, falling back in curved sheets of fire shaped like the petals of a full-blown rose. Indeed this awful gas jet resembled nothing so much as a great flaming flower rising out of the black water. Below was the straight stalk, a foot or more thick, and above the dreadful bloom. And as for the fearfulness of it and its fierce and awesome beauty, who can describe it? Certainly I cannot. Although we were now some five hundred yards away, it, notwithstanding the steam, lit up the whole cavern as clear as day, and we could see that the roof was here about forty feet above us, and washed perfectly smooth with water. The rock was black, and here and there I could make out long shining lines of ore running through it like great veins, but of what metal they were I know not.\n\nOn we rushed towards this pillar of fire, which gleamed fiercer than any furnace ever lit by man.\n\n\u201cKeep the boat to the right, Quatermain\u2014to the right,\u201d shouted Sir Henry, and a minute afterwards I saw him fall forward senseless. Alphonse had already gone. Good was the next to go. There they lay as though dead; only Umslopogaas and I kept our senses. We were within fifty yards of it now, and I saw the Zulu\u2019s head fall forward on his hands. He had gone too, and I was alone. I could not breathe; the fierce heat dried me up. For yards and yards round the great rose of fire the rock-roof was red-hot. The wood of the boat was almost burning. I saw the feathers on one of the dead swans begin to twist and shrivel up; but I would not give in. I knew that if I did we should pass within three or four yards of the gas jet and perish miserably. I set the paddle so as to turn the canoe as far from it as possible, and held on grimly.\n\nMy eyes seemed to be bursting from my head, and through my closed lids I could see the fierce light. We were nearly opposite now; it roared like all the fires of hell, and the water boiled furiously around it. Five seconds more. We were past; I heard the roar behind me.\n\nThen I too fell senseless. The next thing that I recollect is feeling a breath of air upon my face. My eyes opened with great difficulty. I looked up. Far, far above me there was light, though around me was great gloom. Then I remembered and looked. The canoe still floated down the river, and in the bottom of it lay the naked forms of my companions. \u201cWere they dead?\u201d I wondered. \u201cWas I left alone in this awful place?\u201d I knew not. Next I became conscious of a burning thirst. I put my hand over the edge of the boat into the water and drew it up again with a cry. No wonder: nearly all the skin was burnt off the back of it. The water, however, was cold, or nearly so, and I drank pints and splashed myself all over. My body seemed to suck up the fluid as one may see a brick wall suck up rain after a drought; but where I was burnt the touch of it caused intense pain. Then I bethought myself of the others, and, dragging myself towards them with difficulty, I sprinkled them with water, and to my joy they began to recover\u2014Umslopogaas first, then the others. Next they drank, absorbing water like so many sponges. Then, feeling chilly\u2014a queer contrast to our recent sensations\u2014we began as best we could to get into our clothes. As we did so Good pointed to the port side of the canoe: it was all blistered with heat, and in places actually charred. Had it been built like our civilized boats, Good said that the planks would certainly have warped and let in enough water to sink us; but fortunately it was dug out of the soft, willowy wood of a single great tree, and had sides nearly three inches and a bottom four inches thick. What that awful flame was we never discovered, but I suppose that there was at this spot a crack or hole in the bed of the river through which a vast volume of gas forced its way from its volcanic home in the bowels of the earth towards the upper air. How it first became ignited is, of course, impossible to say\u2014probably, I should think, from some spontaneous explosion of mephitic gases.",
    "As soon as we were on shore, a number of the men who had rowed the big boat took possession of our few goods and chattels, and started with them up the splendid staircase, our guide indicating to us by means of motions that the things were perfectly safe. This done, he turned to the right and led the way to a small house, which was, as I afterwards discovered, an inn. Entering into a good-sized room, we saw that a wooden table was already furnished with food, presumably in preparation for us. Here our guide motioned us to be seated on a bench that ran the length of the table. We did not require a second invitation, but at once fell to ravenously on the viands before us, which were served on wooden platters, and consisted of cold goat\u2019s-flesh, wrapped up in some kind of leaf that gave it a delicious flavour, green vegetables resembling lettuces, brown bread, and red wine poured from a skin into horn mugs. This wine was peculiarly soft and good, having something of the flavour of Burgundy. Twenty minutes after we sat down at that hospitable board we rose from it, feeling like new men. After all that we had gone through we needed two things, food and rest, and the food of itself was a great blessing to us. Two girls of the same charming cast of face as the first whom we had seen waited on us while we ate, and very nicely they did it. They were also dressed in the same fashion namely, in a white linen petticoat coming to the knee, and with the toga-like garment of brown cloth, leaving bare the right arm and breast. I afterwards found out that this was the national dress, and regulated by an iron custom, though of course subject to variations. Thus, if the petticoat was pure white, it signified that the wearer was unmarried; if white, with a straight purple stripe round the edge, that she was married and a first or legal wife; if with a black stripe, that she was a widow. In the same way the toga, or \u201ckaf\u201d, as they call it, was of different shades of colour, from pure white to the deepest brown, according to the rank of the wearer, and embroidered at the end in various ways. This also applies to the \u201cshirts\u201d or tunics worn by the men, which varied in material and colour; but the kilts were always the same except as regards quality. One thing, however, every man and woman in the country wore as the national insignia, and that was the thick band of gold round the right arm above the elbow, and the left leg beneath the knee. People of high rank also wore a torque of gold round the neck, and I observed that our guide had one on.\n\nSo soon as we had finished our meal our venerable conductor, who had been standing all the while, regarding us with inquiring eyes, and our guns with something as like fear as his pride would allow him to show, bowed towards Good, whom he evidently took for the leader of the party on account of the splendour of his apparel, and once more led the way through the door and to the foot of the great staircase. Here we paused for a moment to admire two colossal lions, each hewn from a single block of pure black marble, and standing rampant on the terminations of the wide balustrades of the staircase. These lions are magnificently executed, and it is said were sculptured by Rademas, the great prince who designed the staircase, and who was without doubt, to judge from the many beautiful examples of his art that we saw afterwards, one of the finest sculptors who ever lived, either in this or any other country. Then we climbed almost with a feeling of awe up that splendid stair, a work executed for all time and that will, I do not doubt, be admired thousands of years hence by generations unborn unless an earthquake should throw it down. Even Umslopogaas, who as a general rule made it a point of honour not to show astonishment, which he considered undignified, was fairly startled out of himself, and asked if the \u201cbridge had been built by men or devils\u201d, which was his vague way of alluding to any supernatural power. But Alphonse did not care about it. Its solid grandeur jarred upon the frivolous little Frenchman, who said that it was all \u201ctres magnifique, mais triste\u2014ah, triste!\u201d and went on to suggest that it would be improved if the balustrades were _gilt_.\n\nOn we went up the first flight of one hundred and twenty steps, across the broad platform joining it to the second flight, where we paused to admire the glorious view of one of the most beautiful stretches of country that the world can show, edged by the blue waters of the lake. Then we passed on up the stair till at last we reached the top, where we found a large standing space to which there were three entrances, all of small size. Two of these opened on to rather narrow galleries or roadways cut in the face of the precipice that ran round the palace walls and led to the principal thoroughfares of the city, and were used by the inhabitants passing up and down from the docks. These were defended by gates of bronze, and also, as we afterwards learnt, it was possible to let down a portion of the roadways themselves by withdrawing certain bolts, and thus render it quite impracticable for an enemy to pass. The third entrance consisted of a flight of ten curved black marble steps leading to a doorway cut in the palace wall. This wall was in itself a work of art, being built of huge blocks of granite to the height of forty feet, and so fashioned that its face was concave, whereby it was rendered practically impossible for it to be scaled. To this doorway our guide led us. The door, which was massive, and made of wood protected by an outer gate of bronze, was closed; but on our approach it was thrown wide, and we were met by the challenge of a sentry, who was armed with a heavy triangular-bladed spear, not unlike a bayonet in shape, and a cutting sword, and protected by breast and back plates of skilfully prepared hippopotamus hide, and a small round shield fashioned of the same tough material. The sword instantly attracted our attention; it was practically identical with the one in the possession of Mr Mackenzie which he had obtained from the ill-starred wanderer. There was no mistaking the gold-lined fretwork cut in the thickness of the blade. So the man had told the truth after all. Our guide instantly gave a password, which the soldier acknowledged by letting the iron shaft of his spear fall with a ringing sound upon the pavement, and we passed on through the massive wall into the courtyard of the palace. This was about forty yards square, and laid out in flower-beds full of lovely shrubs and plants, many of which were quite new to me. Through the centre of this garden ran a broad walk formed of powdered shells brought from the lake in the place of gravel. Following this we came to another doorway with a round heavy arch, which is hung with thick curtains, for there are no doors in the palace itself. Then came another short passage, and we were in the great hall of the palace, and once more stood astonished at the simple and yet overpowering grandeur of the place.\n\nThe hall is, as we afterwards learnt, one hundred and fifty feet long by eighty wide, and has a magnificent arched roof of carved wood. Down the entire length of the building there are on either side, and at a distance of twenty feet from the wall, slender shafts of black marble springing sheer to the roof, beautifully fluted, and with carved capitals. At one end of this great place which these pillars support is the group of which I have already spoken as executed by the King Rademas to commemorate his building of the staircase; and really, when we had time to admire it, its loveliness almost struck us dumb. The group, of which the figures are in white, and the rest is black marble, is about half as large again as life, and represents a young man of noble countenance and form sleeping heavily upon a couch. One arm is carelessly thrown over the side of this couch, and his head reposes upon the other, its curling locks partially hiding it. Bending over him, her hand resting on his forehead, is a draped female form of such white loveliness as to make the beholder\u2019s breath stand still. And as for the calm glory that shines upon her perfect face\u2014well, I can never hope to describe it. But there it rests like the shadow of an angel\u2019s smile; and power, love, and divinity all have their part in it. Her eyes are fixed upon the sleeping youth, and perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this beautiful work is the success with which the artist has succeeded in depicting on the sleeper\u2019s worn and weary face the sudden rising of a new and spiritual thought as the spell begins to work within his mind. You can see that an inspiration is breaking in upon the darkness of the man\u2019s soul as the dawn breaks in upon the darkness of night. It is a glorious piece of statuary, and none but a genius could have conceived it. Between each of the black marble columns is some such group of figures, some allegorical, and some representing the persons and wives of deceased monarchs or great men; but none of them, in our opinion, comes up to the one I have described, although several are from the hand of the sculptor and engineer, King Rademas.\n\nIn the exact centre of the hall was a solid mass of black marble about the size of a baby\u2019s arm-chair, which it rather resembled in appearance. This, as we afterwards learnt, was the sacred stone of this remarkable people, and on it their monarchs laid their hand after the ceremony of coronation, and swore by the sun to safeguard the interests of the empire, and to maintain its customs, traditions, and laws. This stone was evidently exceedingly ancient (as indeed all stones are), and was scored down its sides with long marks or lines, which Sir Henry said proved it to have been a fragment that at some remote period in its history had been ground in the iron jaws of glaciers. There was a curious prophecy about this block of marble, which was reported among the people to have fallen from the sun, to the effect that when it was shattered into fragments a king of alien race should rule over the land. As the stone, however, looked remarkably solid, the native princes seemed to have a fair chance of keeping their own for many a long year.\n\nAt the end of the hall is a dais spread with rich carpets, on which two thrones are set side by side. These thrones are shaped like great chairs, and made of solid gold. The seats are richly cushioned, but the backs are left bare, and on each is carved the emblem of the sun, shooting out his fiery rays in all directions. The footstools are golden lions couchant, with yellow topazes set in them for eyes. There are no other gems about them.\n\nThe place is lighted by numerous but narrow windows, placed high up, cut on the principle of the loopholes to be seen in ancient castles, but innocent of glass, which was evidently unknown here.",
    "And so the people cheered till the roof rang; but Sorais of the Night stood there with downcast eyes, for she could not bear to see her sister\u2019s triumph, which robbed her of the man whom she had hoped to win, and in the awfulness of her jealous anger she trembled and turned white like an aspen in the wind. I think I have said somewhere of her that she reminded me of the sea on a calm day, having the same aspect of sleeping power about her. Well, it was all awake now, and like the face of the furious ocean it awed and yet fascinated me. A really handsome woman in a royal rage is always a beautiful sight, but such beauty and such a rage I never saw combined before, and I can only say that the effect produced was well worthy of the two.\n\n\nShe lifted her white face, the teeth set, and there were purple rings beneath her glowing eyes. Thrice she tried to speak and thrice she failed, but at last her voice came. Raising her silver spear, she shook it, and the light gleamed from it and from the golden scales of her cuirass.\n\n\n\u201cAnd thinkest thou, Nyleptha,\u201d she said in notes which pealed through the great hall like a clarion, \u201cthinkest thou that I, Sorais, a Queen of the Zu-Vendi, will brook that this base outlander shall sit upon my father\u2019s throne and rear up half-breeds to fill the place of the great House of the Stairway? Never! never! while there is life in my bosom and a man to follow me and a spear to strike with. Who is on my side? Who?\n\n\nNow hand thou over this foreign wolf and those who came hither to prey with him to the doom of fire, for have they not committed the deadly sin against the sun? or, Nyleptha, I give thee War\u2014red War! Ay, I say to thee that the path of thy passion shall be marked out by the blazing of thy towns and watered with the blood of those who cleave to thee. On thy head rest the burden of the deed, and in thy ears ring the groans of the dying and the cries of the widows and those who are left fatherless for ever and for ever.\n\n\nI tell thee I will tear thee, Nyleptha, the White Queen, from thy throne, and that thou shalt be hurled\u2014ay, hurled even from the topmost stair of the great way to the foot thereof, in that thou hast covered the name of the House of him who built it with black shame. And I tell ye strangers\u2014all save Bougwan, whom because thou didst do me a service I will save alive if thou wilt leave these men and follow me\u201d (here poor Good shook his head vigorously and ejaculated \u201cCan\u2019t be done\u201d in English)\u2014\u201cthat I will wrap you in sheets of gold and hang you yet alive in chains from the four golden trumpets of the four angels that fly east and west and north and south from the giddiest pinnacles of the Temple, so that ye may be a token and a warning to the land. And as for thee, Incubu, thou shalt die in yet another fashion that I will not tell thee now.\u201d\n\n\nShe ceased, panting for breath, for her passion shook her like a storm, and a murmur, partly of horror and partly of admiration, ran through the hall. Then Nyleptha answered calmly and with dignity:\n\n\n\u201cIll would it become my place and dignity, oh sister, so to speak as thou hast spoken and so to threat as thou hast threatened. Yet if thou wilt make war, then will I strive to bear up against thee, for if my hand seem soft, yet shalt thou find it of iron when it grips thine armies by the throat. Sorais, I fear thee not. I weep for that which thou wilt bring upon our people and on thyself, but for myself I say\u2014I fear thee not. Yet thou, who but yesterday didst strive to win my lover and my lord from me, whom today thou dost call a \u2018foreign wolf\u2019, to be _thy_ lover and _thy_ lord\u201d (here there was an immense sensation in the hall), \u201cthou who but last night, as I have learnt but since thou didst enter here, didst creep like a snake into my sleeping-place\u2014ay, even by a secret way, and wouldst have foully murdered me, thy sister, as I lay asleep\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is false, it is false!\u201d rang out Agon\u2019s and a score of other voices.\n\n\n\u201cIt is _not_ false,\u201d said I, producing the broken point of the dagger and holding it up. \u201cWhere is the haft from which this flew, oh Sorais?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is not false,\u201d cried Good, determined at last to act like a loyal man. \u201cI took the Lady of the Night by the White Queen\u2019s bed, and on my breast the dagger broke.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWho is on my side?\u201d cried Sorais, shaking her silver spear, for she saw that public sympathy was turning against her. \u201cWhat, Bougwan, thou comest not?\u201d she said, addressing Good, who was standing close to her, in a low, concentrated voice. \u201cThou pale-souled fool, for a reward thou shalt eat out thy heart with love of me and not be satisfied, and thou mightest have been my husband and a king! At least I hold _thee_ in chains that cannot be broken.\n\n\n_War! war! war!_\u201d she cried. \u201cHere, with my hand upon the sacred stone that shall endure, so runs the prophecy, till the Zu-Vendi set their necks beneath an alien yoke, I declare war to the end. Who follows Sorais of the Night to victory and honour?\u201d\n\n\nInstantly the whole concourse began to break up in indescribable confusion. Many present hastened to throw in their lot with the \u201cLady of the Night\u201d, but some came from her following to us. Amongst the former was an under officer of Nyleptha\u2019s own guard, who suddenly turned and made a run for the doorway through which Sorais\u2019 people were already passing. Umslopogaas, who was present and had taken the whole scene in, seeing with admirable presence of mind that if this soldier got away others would follow his example, seized the man, who drew his sword and struck at him. Thereon the Zulu sprang back with a wild shout, and, avoiding the sword cuts, began to peck at his foe with his terrible axe, till in a few seconds the man\u2019s fate overtook him and he fell with a clash heavily and quite dead upon the marble floor.\n\n\nThis was the first blood spilt in the war.\n\n\n\u201cShut the gates,\u201d I shouted, thinking that we might perhaps catch Sorais so, and not being troubled with the idea of committing sacrilege. But the order came too late, her guards were already passing through them, and in another minute the streets echoed with the furious galloping of horses and the rolling of her chariots.\n\n\nSo, drawing half the people after her, Sorais was soon passing like a whirlwind through the Frowning City on her road to her headquarters at M\u2019Arstuna, a fortress situated a hundred and thirty miles to the north of Milosis.\n\n\nAnd after that the city was alive with the endless tramp of regiments and preparations for the gathering war, and old Umslopogaas once more began to sit in the sunshine and go through a show of sharpening Inkosi-kaas\u2019s razor edge.",
    "So I went back to our quarters and ruminated over things in general, and watched old Umslopogaas whetting his axe outside the window as a vulture whets his beak beside a dying ox.\n\n\nAnd in about an hour\u2019s time Sir Henry came tearing over, looking very radiant and wildly excited, and found Good and myself and even Umslopogaas, and asked us if we should like to assist at a real wedding. Of course we said yes, and off we went to the chapel, where we found Agon looking as sulky as any High Priest possibly could, and no wonder. It appeared that he and Nyleptha had a slight difference of opinion about the coming ceremony. He had flatly refused to celebrate it, or to allow any of his priests to do so, whereupon Nyleptha became very angry and told him that she, as Queen, was head of the Church, and meant to be obeyed. Indeed, she played the part of a Zu-Vendi Henry the Eighth to perfection, and insisted that, if she wanted to be married, she would be married, and that he should marry her.\n\n\nHe still refused to go through the ceremony, so she clinched her argument thus\u2014\n\n\n\u201cWell, I cannot execute a High Priest, because there is an absurd prejudice against it, and I cannot imprison him because all his subordinates would raise a crying that would bring the stars down on Zu-Vendis and crush it; but I _can_ leave him to contemplate the altar of the Sun without anything to eat, because that is his natural vocation, and if thou wilt not marry me, O Agon! thou shalt be placed before the altar yonder with nought but a little water till such time as thou hast reconsidered the matter.\u201d\n\n\nNow, as it happened, Agon had been hurried away that morning without his breakfast, and was already exceedingly hungry, so he presently modified his views and consented to marry them, saying at the same time that he washed his hands of all responsibility in the matter.\n\n\nSo it chanced that presently, attended only by two of her favourite maidens, came the Queen Nyleptha, with happy blushing face and downcast eyes, dressed in pure white, without embroidery of any sort, as seems to be the fashion on these occasions in most countries of the world. She did not wear a single ornament, even her gold circlets were removed, and I thought that if possible she looked more lovely than ever without them, as really superbly beautiful women do.\n\n\nShe came, curtseyed low to Sir Henry, and then took his hand and led him up before the altar, and after a little pause, in a slow, clear voice uttered the following words, which are customary in Zu-Vendis if the bride desires and the man consents:\u2014\n\n\n\u201cThou dost swear by the Sun that thou wilt take no other woman to wife unless I lay my hand upon her and bid her come?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI swear it,\u201d answered Sir Henry; adding in English, \u201cOne is quite enough for me.\u201d\n\n\nThen Agon, who had been sulking in a corner near the altar, came forward and gabbled off something into his beard at such a rate that I could not follow it, but it appeared to be an invocation to the Sun to bless the union and make it fruitful. I observed that Nyleptha listened very closely to every word, and afterwards discovered that she was afraid lest Agon should play her a trick, and by going through the invocations backwards divorce them instead of marry them. At the end of the invocations they were asked, as in our service, if they took each other for husband and wife, and on their assenting they kissed each other before the altar, and the service was over, so far as their rites were concerned. But it seemed to me that there was yet something wanting, and so I produced a Prayer-Book, which has, together with the \u201cIngoldsby Legends\u201d, that I often read when I lie awake at night, accompanied me in all my later wanderings. I gave it to my poor boy Harry years ago, and after his death I found it among his things and took it back again.\n\n\n\u201cCurtis,\u201d I said, \u201cI am not a clergyman, and I do not know if what I am going to propose is allowable\u2014I know it is not legal\u2014but if you and the Queen have no objection I should like to read the English marriage service over you. It is a solemn step which you are taking, and I think that you ought, so far as circumstances will allow, to give it the sanction of your own religion.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI have thought of that,\u201d he said, \u201cand I wish you would. I do not feel half married yet.\u201d\n\n\nNyleptha raised no objection, fully understanding that her husband wished to celebrate the marriage according to the rites prevailing in his own country, and so I set to work and read the service, from \u201cDearly beloved\u201d to \u201camazement\u201d, as well as I could; and when I came to \u201cI, Henry, take thee, Nyleptha,\u201d I translated, and also \u201cI, Nyleptha, take thee, Henry,\u201d which she repeated after me very well. Then Sir Henry took a plain gold ring from his little finger and placed it on hers, and so on to the end. The ring had been Curtis\u2019 mother\u2019s wedding-ring, and I could not help thinking how astonished the dear old Yorkshire lady would have been if she could have foreseen that her wedding-ring was to serve a similar purpose for Nyleptha, a Queen of the Zu-Vendi.\n\n\nAs for Agon, he was with difficulty kept calm while this second ceremony was going on, for he at once understood that it was religious in its nature, and doubtless bethought him of the ninety-five new faiths which loomed so ominously in his eyes. Indeed, he at once set me down as a rival High Priest, and hated me accordingly. However, in the end off he went, positively bristling with indignation, and I knew that we might look out for danger from his direction.\n\n\nAnd off went Good and I, and old Umslopogaas also, leaving the happy pair to themselves, and very low we all felt. Marriages are supposed to be cheerful things, but my experience is that they are very much the reverse to everybody, except perhaps the two people chiefly interested. They mean the breaking-up of so many old ties as well as the undertaking of so many new ones, and there is always something sad about the passing away of the old order. Now to take this case for instance: Sir Henry Curtis is the best and kindest fellow and friend in the world, but he has never been quite the same since that little scene in the chapel. It is always Nyleptha this and Nyleptha that\u2014Nyleptha, in short, from morning till night in one way or another, either expressed or understood. And as for the old friends\u2014well, of course they have taken the place that old friends ought to take, and which ladies are as a rule very careful to see they do take when a man marries, and that is, the second place. Yes, he would be angry if anybody said so, but it is a fact for all that. He is not quite the same, and Nyleptha is very sweet and very charming, but I think that she likes him to understand that she has married _him_, and not Quatermain, Good, and Co. But there! what is the use of grumbling? It is all very right and proper, as any married lady would have no difficulty in explaining, and I am a selfish, jealous old man, though I hope I never show it.\n\n\nSo Good and I went and ate in silence and then indulged in an extra fine flagon of old Zu-Vendian to keep our spirits up, and presently one of our attendants came and told a story that gave us something to think about.\n\n\nIt may, perhaps, be remembered that, after his quarrel with Umslopogaas, Alphonse had gone off in an exceedingly ill temper to sulk over his scratches. Well, it appears that he walked right past the Temple to the Sun, down the wide road on the further side of the slope it crowns, and thence on into the beautiful park, or pleasure gardens, which are laid out just beyond the outer wall. After wandering about there for a little he started to return, but was met near the outer gate by Sorais\u2019 train of chariots, which were galloping furiously along the great northern road. When she caught sight of Alphonse, Sorais halted her train and called to him. On approaching he was instantly seized and dragged into one of the chariots and carried off, \u201ccrying out loudly\u201d, as our informant said, and as from my general knowledge of him I can well believe.",
    "At the top of the rise we halted for a second to breathe our horses; and, turning, glanced at the battle beneath us, which, illumined as it was by the fierce rays of the sinking sun staining the whole scene red, looked from where we were more like some wild titanic picture than an actual hand-to-hand combat. The distinguishing scenic effect from that distance was the countless distinct flashes of light reflected from the swords and spears, otherwise the panorama was not so grand as might have been expected. The great green lap of sward in which the struggle was being fought out, the bold round outline of the hills behind, and the wide sweep of the plain beyond, seemed to dwarf it; and what was tremendous enough when one was in it, grew insignificant when viewed from the distance. But is it not thus with all the affairs and doings of our race about which we blow the loud trumpet and make such a fuss and worry? How utterly antlike, and morally and physically insignificant, must they seem to the calm eyes that watch them from the arching depths above!\n\n\n\u201cWe win the day, Macumazahn,\u201d said old Umslopogaas, taking in the whole situation with a glance of his practised eye. \u201cLook, the Lady of the Night\u2019s forces give on every side, there is no stiffness left in them, they bend like hot iron, they are fighting with but half a heart. But alas! the battle will in a manner be drawn, for the darkness gathers, and the regiments will not be able to follow and slay!\u201d\u2014and he shook his head sadly. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cI do not think that they will fight again. We have fed them with too strong a meat. Ah! it is well to have lived! At last I have seen a fight worth seeing.\u201d\n\n\nBy this time we were on our way again, and as we went side by side I told him what our mission was, and how that, if it failed, all the lives that had been lost that day would have been lost in vain.\n\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d he said, \u201cnigh on a hundred miles and no horses but these, and to be there before the dawn! Well\u2014away! away! man can but try, Macumazahn; and mayhap we shall be there in time to split that old \u2018witch-finder\u2019s\u2019 [Agon\u2019s] skull for him. Once he wanted to burn us, the old \u2018rain-maker\u2019, did he? And now he would set a snare for my mother [Nyleptha], would he? Good! So sure as my name is the name of the Woodpecker, so surely, be my mother alive or dead, will I split him to the beard. Ay, by T\u2019Chaka\u2019s head I swear it!\u201d and he shook Inkosi-kaas as he galloped. By now the darkness was closing in, but fortunately there would be a moon later, and the road was good.\n\n\nOn we sped through the twilight, the two splendid horses we bestrode had got their wind by this, and were sweeping along with a wide steady stride that neither failed nor varied for mile upon mile. Down the side of slopes we galloped, across wide vales that stretched to the foot of far-off hills. Nearer and nearer grew the blue hills; now we were travelling up their steeps, and now we were over and passing towards others that sprang up like visions in the far, faint distance beyond.\n\n\nOn, never pausing or drawing rein, through the perfect quiet of the night, that was set like a song to the falling music of our horses\u2019 hoofs; on, past deserted villages, where only some forgotten starving dog howled a melancholy welcome; on, past lonely moated dwellings; on, through the white patchy moonlight, that lay coldly upon the wide bosom of the earth, as though there was no warmth in it; on, knee to knee, for hour after hour!\n\n\nWe spake not, but bent us forward on the necks of those two glorious horses, and listened to their deep, long-drawn breaths as they filled their great lungs, and to the regular unfaltering ring of their round hoofs. Grim and black indeed did old Umslopogaas look beside me, mounted upon the great white horse, like Death in the Revelation of St John, as now and again lifting his fierce set face he gazed out along the road, and pointed with his axe towards some distant rise or house.\n\n\nAnd so on, still on, without break or pause for hour after hour.\n\n\nAt last I felt that even the splendid animal that I rode was beginning to give out. I looked at my watch; it was nearly midnight, and we were considerably more than half way. On the top of a rise was a little spring, which I remembered because I had slept by it a few nights before, and here I motioned to Umslopogaas to pull up, having determined to give the horses and ourselves ten minutes to breathe in. He did so, and we dismounted\u2014that is to say, Umslopogaas did, and then helped me off, for what with fatigue, stiffness, and the pain of my wound, I could not do so for myself; and then the gallant horses stood panting there, resting first one leg and then another, while the sweat fell drip, drip, from them, and the steam rose and hung in pale clouds in the still night air.\n\n\nLeaving Umslopogaas to hold the horses, I hobbled to the spring and drank deep of its sweet waters. I had had nothing but a single mouthful of wine since midday, when the battle began, and I was parched up, though my fatigue was too great to allow me to feel hungry. Then, having laved my fevered head and hands, I returned, and the Zulu went and drank. Next we allowed the horses to take a couple of mouthfuls each\u2014no more; and oh, what a struggle we had to get the poor beasts away from the water! There were yet two minutes, and I employed it in hobbling up and down to try and relieve my stiffness, and in inspecting the condition of the horses. My mare, gallant animal though she was, was evidently much distressed; she hung her head, and her eye looked sick and dull; but Daylight, Nyleptha\u2019s glorious horse\u2014who, if he is served aright, should, like the steeds who saved great Rameses in his need, feed for the rest of his days out of a golden manger\u2014was still comparatively speaking fresh, notwithstanding the fact that he had had by far the heavier weight to carry. He was \u201ctucked up\u201d, indeed, and his legs were weary, but his eye was bright and clear, and he held his shapely head up and gazed out into the darkness round him in a way that seemed to say that whoever failed _he_ was good for those five-and-forty miles that yet lay between us and Milosis. Then Umslopogaas helped me into the saddle and\u2014vigorous old savage that he was!\u2014vaulted into his own without touching a stirrup, and we were off once more, slowly at first, till the horses got into their stride, and then more swiftly. So we passed over another ten miles, and then came a long, weary rise of some six or seven miles, and three times did my poor black mare nearly come to the ground with me. But on the top she seemed to gather herself together, and rattled down the slope with long, convulsive strides, breathing in gasps. We did that three or four miles more swiftly than any since we had started on our wild ride, but I felt it to be a last effort, and I was right. Suddenly my poor horse took the bit between her teeth and bolted furiously along a stretch of level ground for some three or four hundred yards, and then, with two or three jerky strides, pulled herself up and fell with a crash right on to her head, I rolling myself free as she did so. As I struggled to my feet the brave beast raised her head and looked at me with piteous bloodshot eyes, and then her head dropped with a groan and she was dead. Her heart was broken.\n\n\nUmslopogaas pulled up beside the carcase, and I looked at him in dismay. There were still more than twenty miles to do by dawn, and how were we to do it with one horse? It seemed hopeless, but I had forgotten the old Zulu\u2019s extraordinary running powers.\n\n\nWithout a single word he sprang from the saddle and began to hoist me into it.\n\n\n\u201cWhat wilt thou do?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cRun,\u201d he answered, seizing my stirrup-leather.\n\n\nThen off we went again, almost as fast as before; and oh, the relief it was to me to get that change of horses! Anybody who has ever ridden against time will know what it meant.\n\n\nDaylight sped along at a long stretching hand-gallop, giving the gaunt Zulu a lift at every stride. It was a wonderful thing to see old Umslopogaas run mile after mile, his lips slightly parted and his nostrils agape like the horse\u2019s. Every five miles or so we stopped for a few minutes to let him get his breath, and then flew on again.\n\n\n\u201cCanst thou go farther,\u201d I said at the third of these stoppages, \u201cor shall I leave thee to follow me?\u201d\n\n\nHe pointed with his axe to a dim mass before us. It was the Temple of the Sun, now not more than five miles away.\n\n\n\u201cI reach it or I die,\u201d he gasped."

  "H. Rider Haggard -- Allan and the Holy Flower": [
    "I do not suppose that anyone who knows the name of Allan Quatermain would be likely to associate it with flowers, and especially with orchids. Yet as it happens it was once my lot to take part in an orchid hunt of so remarkable a character that I think its details should not be lost. At least I will set them down, and if in the after days anyone cares to publish them, well--he is at liberty to do so.\n\nIt was in the year--oh! never mind the year, it was a long while ago when I was much younger, that I went on a hunting expedition to the north of the Limpopo River which borders the Transvaal. My companion was a gentleman of the name of Scroope, Charles Scroope. He had come out to Durban from England in search of sport. At least, that was one of his reasons. The other was a lady whom I will call Miss Margaret Manners, though that was not her name.\n\nIt seems that these two were engaged to be married, and really attached to each other. Unfortunately, however, they quarrelled violently about another gentleman with whom Miss Manners danced four consecutive dances, including two that were promised to her _fianc\u00e9_ at a Hunt ball in Essex, where they all lived. Explanations, or rather argument, followed. Mr. Scroope said that he would not tolerate such conduct. Miss Manners replied that she would not be dictated to; she was her own mistress and meant to remain so. Mr. Scroope exclaimed that she might so far as he was concerned. She answered that she never wished to see his face again. He declared with emphasis that she never should and that he was going to Africa to shoot elephants.\n\nWhat is more, he went, starting from his Essex home the next day without leaving any address. As it transpired afterwards, long afterwards, had he waited till the post came in he would have received a letter that might have changed his plans. But they were high-spirited young people, both of them, and played the fool after the fashion of those in love.\n\nWell, Charles Scroope turned up in Durban, which was but a poor place then, and there we met in the bar of the Royal Hotel.\n\n\u201cIf you want to kill big game,\u201d I heard some one say, who it was I really forget, \u201cthere\u2019s the man to show you how to do it--Hunter Quatermain; the best shot in Africa and one of the finest fellows, too.\u201d\n\nI sat still, smoking my pipe and pretending to hear nothing. It is awkward to listen to oneself being praised, and I was always a shy man.\n\nThen after a whispered colloquy Mr. Scroope was brought forward and introduced to me. I bowed as nicely as I could and ran my eye over him. He was a tall young man with dark eyes and a rather romantic aspect (that was due to his love affair), but I came to the conclusion that I liked the cut of his jib. When he spoke, that conclusion was affirmed. I always think there is a great deal in a voice; personally, I judge by it almost as much as by the face. This voice was particularly pleasant and sympathetic, though there was nothing very original or striking in the words by which it was, so to speak, introduced to me. These were:\n\n\u201cHow do you do, sir. Will you have a split?\u201d\n\nI answered that I never drank spirits in the daytime, or at least not often, but that I should be pleased to take a small bottle of beer.\n\nWhen the beer was consumed we walked up together to my little house on what is now called the Berea, the same in which, amongst others, I received my friends, Curtis and Good, in after days, and there we dined. Indeed, Charlie Scroope never left that house until we started on our shooting expedition.\n\nNow I must cut all this story short, since it is only incidentally that it has to do with the tale I am going to tell. Mr. Scroope was a rich man and as he offered to pay all the expenses of the expedition while I was to take all the profit in the shape of ivory or anything else that might accrue, of course I did not decline his proposal.\n\nEverything went well with us on that trip until its unfortunate end. We only killed two elephants, but of other game we found plenty. It was when we were near Delagoa Bay on our return that the accident happened.\n\nWe were out one evening trying to shoot something for our dinner, when between the trees I caught sight of a small buck. It vanished round a little promontory of rock which projected from the side of the kloof, walking quietly, not running in alarm. We followed after it. I was the first, and had just wriggled round these rocks and perceived the buck standing about ten paces away (it was a bush-bok), when I heard a rustle among the bushes on the top of the rock not a dozen feet above my head, and Charlie Scroope\u2019s voice calling:\n\n\u201cLook out, Quatermain! He\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s coming?\u201d I answered in an irritated tone, for the noise had made the buck run away.\n\nThen it occurred to me, all in an instant of course, that a man would not begin to shout like that for nothing; at any rate when his supper was concerned. So I glanced up above and behind me. To this moment I can remember exactly what I saw. There was the granite water-worn boulder, or rather several boulders, with ferns growing in their cracks of the maiden-hair tribe, most of them, but some had a silver sheen on the under side of their leaves. On one of these leaves, bending it down, sat a large beetle with red wings and a black body engaged in rubbing its antenn\u00e6 with its front paws. And above, just appearing over the top of the rock, was the head of an extremely fine leopard. As I write, I seem to perceive its square jowl outlined against the arc of the quiet evening sky with the saliva dropping from its lips.",
    "Amongst other things, he showed me many of the specimens that he had collected during his recent journey; insects and beautiful butterflies neatly pinned into boxes, also a quantity of dried flowers pressed between sheets of blotting paper, amongst them some which he told me were orchids. Observing that these attracted me, he asked me if I would like to see the most wonderful orchid in the whole world. Of course I said yes, whereon he produced out of one of his cases a flat package about two feet six square. He undid the grass mats in which it was wrapped, striped, delicately woven mats such as they make in the neighbourhood of Zanzibar. Within these was the lid of a packing-case. Then came more mats and some copies of _The Cape Journal_ spread out flat. Then sheets of blotting paper, and last of all between two pieces of cardboard, a flower and one leaf of the plant on which it grew.\n\nEven in its dried state it was a wondrous thing, measuring twenty-four inches from the tip of one wing or petal to the tip of the other, by twenty inches from the top of the back sheath to the bottom of the pouch. The measurement of the back sheath itself I forget, but it must have been quite a foot across. In colour it was, or had been, bright golden, but the back sheath was white, barred with lines of black, and in the exact centre of the pouch was a single black spot shaped like the head of a great ape. There were the overhanging brows, the deep recessed eyes, the surly mouth, the massive jaws--everything.\n\nAlthough at that time I had never seen a gorilla in the flesh, I had seen a coloured picture of the brute, and if that picture had been photographed on the flower the likeness could not have been more perfect.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, amazed.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said Brother John, sometimes he used this formal term when excited, \u201cit is the most marvellous Cypripedium in the whole earth, and, sir, I have discovered it. A healthy root of that plant will be worth \u00a320,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better than gold mining,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, have you got the root?\u201d\n\nBrother John shook his head sadly as he answered:\n\n\u201cNo such luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that as you have the flower?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Allan. For a year past and more I have been collecting in the district back of Kilwa and found some wonderful things, yes, wonderful. At last, about three hundred miles inland, I came to a tribe, or rather, a people, that no white man had ever visited. They are called the Mazitu, a numerous and warlike people of bastard Zulu blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard of them,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cThey broke north before the days of Senzangakona, two hundred years or more ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I could make myself understood among them because they still talk a corrupt Zulu, as do all the tribes in those parts. At first they wanted to kill me, but let me go because they thought that I was mad. Everyone thinks that I am mad, Allan; it is a kind of public delusion, whereas I think that I am sane and that most other people are mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cA private delusion,\u201d I suggested hurriedly, as I did not wish to discuss Brother John\u2019s sanity. \u201cWell, go on about the Mazitu.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater they discovered that I had skill in medicine, and their king, Bausi, came to me to be treated for a great external tumour. I risked an operation and cured him. It was anxious work, for if he had died I should have died too, though that would not have troubled me very much,\u201d and he sighed. \u201cOf course, from that moment I was supposed to be a great magician. Also Bausi made a blood brotherhood with me, transfusing some of his blood into my veins and some of mine into his. I only hope he has not inoculated me with his tumours, which are congenital. So I became Bausi and Bausi became me. In other words, I was as much chief of the Mazitu as he was, and shall remain so all my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat might be useful,\u201d I said, reflectively, \u201cbut go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI learned that on the western boundary of the Mazitu territory were great swamps; that beyond these swamps was a lake called Kirua, and beyond that a large and fertile land supposed to be an island, with a mountain in its centre. This land is known as Pongo, and so are the people who live there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a native name for the gorilla, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked. \u201cAt least so a fellow who had been on the West Coast told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, then that\u2019s strange, as you will see. Now these Pongo are supposed to be great magicians, and the god they worship is said to be a gorilla, which, if you are right, accounts for their name. Or rather,\u201d he went on, \u201cthey have two gods. The other is that flower you see there. Whether the flower with the monkey\u2019s head on it was the first god and suggested the worship of the beast itself, or _vice versa_, I don\u2019t know. Indeed I know very little, just what I was told by the Mazitu and a man who called himself a Pongo chief, no more.\u201d",
    "The sale languished. There were so many lots of one particular sort of dried orchid that buyers could not be found for them at a reasonable price, and many had to be bought in. At length the genial Mr. Primrose in the rostrum addressed the audience.\n\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, \u201cI quite understand that you didn\u2019t come here to-day to buy a rather poor lot of Cattleya Mossi\u00e6. You came to buy, or to bid for, or to see sold the most wonderful Odontoglossum that has ever been flowered in this country, the property of a famous firm of importers whom I congratulate upon their good fortune in having obtained such a gem. Gentlemen, this miraculous flower ought to adorn a royal greenhouse. But there it is, to be taken away by whoever will pay the most for it, for I am directed to see that it will be sold without reserve. Now, I think,\u201d he added, running his eye over the company, \u201cthat most of our great collectors are represented in this room to-day. It is true that I do not see that spirited and liberal young orchidist, Mr. Somers, but he has left his worthy head-gardener, Mr. Woodden, than whom there is no finer judge of an orchid in England\u201d (here Woodden rocked violently) \u201cto bid for him, as I hope, for the glorious flower of which I have been speaking. Now, as it is exactly half-past one, we will proceed to business. Smith, hand the \u2018Odontoglossum Pavo\u2019 round, that everyone may inspect its beauties, and be careful you don\u2019t let it fall. Gentlemen, I must ask you not to touch it or to defile its purity with tobacco smoke. Eight perfect flowers in bloom, gentlemen, and four--no, five more to open. A strong plant in perfect health, six pseudo-bulbs with leaves, and three without. Two black leads which I am advised can be separated off at the proper time. Now, what bids for the \u2018Odontoglossum Pavo.\u2019 Ah! I wonder who will have the honour of becoming the owner of this perfect, this unmatched production of Nature. Thank you, sir--three hundred. Four. Five. Six. Seven in three places. Eight. Nine. Ten. Oh! gentlemen, let us get on a little faster. Thank you, sir--fifteen. Sixteen. It is against you, Mr Woodden. Ah! thank you, seventeen.\u201d\n\nThere came a pause in the fierce race for \u201cO. Pavo,\u201d which I occupied in reducing seventeen hundred shillings to pounds sterling.\n\nMy word! I thought to myself, \u00a385 is a goodish price to pay for one plant, however rare. Woodden is acting up to his instructions with a vengeance.\n\nThe pleading voice of Mr. Primrose broke in upon my meditations.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, gentlemen!\u201d he said, \u201csurely you are not going to allow the most wondrous production of the floral world, on which I repeat there is no reserve, to be knocked down at this miserable figure. Come, come. Well, if I must, I must, though after such a disgrace I shall get no sleep to-night. One,\u201d and his hammer fell for the first time. \u201cThink, gentlemen, upon my position, think what the eminent owners, who with their usual delicacy have stayed away, will say to me when I am obliged to tell them the disgraceful truth. Two,\u201d and his hammer fell a second time. \u201cSmith, hold up that flower. Let the company see it. Let them know what they are losing.\u201d\n\nSmith held up the flower at which everybody glared. The little ivory hammer circled round Mr. Primrose\u2019s head. It was about to fall, when a quiet man with a long beard who hitherto had not joined in the bidding, lifted his head and said softly:\n\n\u201cEighteen hundred.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Primrose, \u201cI thought so. I thought that the owner of the greatest collection in England would not see this treasure slip from his grasp without a struggle. Against you, Mr. Woodden.\u201d\n\n\u201cNineteen, sir,\u201d said Woodden in a stony voice.\n\n\u201cTwo thousand,\u201d echoed the gentleman with the long beard.\n\n\u201cTwenty-one hundred,\u201d said Woodden.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Mr. Woodden,\u201d cried Mr. Primrose, \u201cyou are indeed representing your principal worthily. I feel sure that you do not mean to stop for a few miserable pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if I knows it,\u201d ejaculated Woodden. \u201cI has my orders and I acts up to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-two hundred,\u201d said Long-beard.\n\n\u201cTwenty-three,\u201d echoed Woodden.\n\n\u201cOh, damn!\u201d shouted Long-beard and rushed from the room.\n\n\u201c\u2018Odontoglossum Pavo\u2019 is going for twenty-three hundred, only twenty-tree hundred,\u201d cried the auctioneer. \u201cAny advance on twenty-three hundred? What? None? Then I must do my duty. One. Two. For the last time--no advance? Three. Gone to Mr. Woodden, bidding for his principal, Mr. Somers.\u201d\n\nThe hammer fell with a sharp tap, and at this moment my young friend sauntered into the room.",
    "At length everything was more or less ready, and the question arose as to what was to be done with Hassan. The Zulus, like Hans, wished to kill him, as Sammy explained to him in his best Arabic. Then this murderous fellow showed what a coward he was at heart. He flung himself upon his knees, he wept, he invoked us in the name of the Compassionate Allah who, he explained, was after all the same God that we worshipped, till Mavovo, growing impatient of the noise, threatened him with his kerry, whereon he became silent. The easy-natured Stephen was for letting him go, a plan that seemed to have advantages, for then at least we should be rid of his abominable company. After reflection, however, I decided that we had better take him along with us, at any rate for a day or so, to hold as a hostage in case the Arabs should follow and attack us. At first he refused to stir, but the assegai of one of the Zulu hunters pressed gently against what remained of his robe, furnished an argument that he could not resist.\n\n\nAt length we were off. I with the two guides went ahead. Then came the bearers, then half of the hunters, then the four donkeys in charge of Hans and Sammy, then Hassan and the rest of the hunters, except Mavovo, who brought up the rear with Stephen. Needless to say, all our rifles were loaded, and generally we were prepared for any emergency. The only path, that which the guides said we must follow, ran by the seashore for a few hundred yards and then turned inland through Hassan\u2019s village where he lived, for it seemed that the old mission house was not used by him. As we marched along a little rocky cliff--it was not more than ten feet high--where a deep-water channel perhaps fifty yards in breadth separated the mainland from the island whence the slaves had been loaded on to the _Maria_, some difficulty arose about the donkeys. One of these slipped its load and another began to buck and evinced an inclination to leap into the sea with its precious burden. The rearguard of hunters ran to get hold of it, when suddenly there was a splash.\n\n\nThe brute\u2019s in! I thought to myself, till a shout told me that not the ass, but Hassan had departed over the cliff\u2019s edge. Watching his opportunity and being, it was clear, a first-rate swimmer, he had flung himself backwards in the midst of the confusion and falling into deep water, promptly dived. About twenty yards from the shore he came up for a moment, then dived again heading for the island. I dare say I could have potted him through the head with a snap shot, but somehow I did not like to kill a man swimming for his life as though he were a hippopotamus or a crocodile. Moreover, the boldness of the manoeuvre appealed to me. So I refrained from firing and called to the others to do likewise.\n\n\nAs our late host approached the shore of the island I saw Arabs running down the rocks to help him out of the water. Either they had not left the place, or had re-occupied it as soon as H.M.S. _Crocodile_ had vanished with her prize. As it was clear that to recapture Hassan would involve an attack upon the garrison of the island which we were in no position to carry out, I gave orders for the march to be resumed. These, the difficulty with the donkey having been overcome, were obeyed at once.\n\n\nIt was fortunate that we did not delay, for scarcely had the caravan got into motion when the Arabs on the island began to fire at us. Luckily no one was hit, and we were soon round a point and under cover; also their shooting was as bad as usual. One missile, however, it was a pot-leg, struck a donkey-load and smashed a bottle of good brandy and a tin of preserved butter. This made me angry, so motioning to the others to proceed I took shelter behind a tree and waited till a torn and dirty turban, which I recognised as that of Hassan, poked up above a rock. Well, I put a bullet through that turban, for I saw the thing fly, but unfortunately, not through the head beneath it. Having left this P.P.C. card on our host, I bolted from the rock and caught up the others.\n\n\nPresently we passed round the village; through it I would not go for fear of an ambuscade. It was quite a big place, enclosed with a strong fence, but hidden from the sea by a rise in the intervening land. In the centre was a large eastern-looking house, where doubtless Hassan dwelt with his harem. After we had gone a little way further, to my astonishment I saw flames breaking out from the palm-leaf roof of this house. At the time I could not imagine how this happened, but when, a day or two later, I observed Hans wearing a pair of large and very handsome gold pendants in his ears and a gold bracelet on his wrist, and found that he and one of the hunters were extremely well set up in the matter of British sovereigns--well, I had my doubts. In due course the truth came out. He and the hunter, an adventurous spirit, slipped through a gate in the fence without being observed, ran across the deserted village to the house, stole the ornaments and money from the women\u2019s apartments and as they departed, fired the place \u201cin exchange for the bottle of good brandy,\u201d as Hans explained.\n\n\nI was inclined to be angry, but after all, as we had been fired on, Hans\u2019s exploit became an act of war rather than a theft. So I made him and his companion divide the gold equally with the rest of the hunters, who no doubt had kept their eyes conveniently shut, not forgetting Sammy, and said no more. They netted \u00a38 apiece, which pleased them very much. In addition to this I gave \u00a31 each, or rather goods to that value, to the bearers as their share of the loot.\n\n\nHassan, I remarked, was evidently a great agriculturist, for the gardens which he worked by slave labour were beautiful, and must have brought him in a large revenue.\n\n\nPassing through these gardens we came to sloping land covered with bush. Here the track was not too good, for the creepers hampered our progress. Indeed, I was very glad when towards sunset we reached the crest of a hill and emerged upon a tableland which was almost clear of trees and rose gradually till it met the horizon. In that bush we might easily have been attacked, but in this open country I was not so much afraid, since the loss to the Arabs would have been great before we were overpowered. As a matter of fact, although spies dogged us for days no assault was ever attempted.",
    "Within forty-eight hours he got his chance, thus: That day we camped early for two reasons. The first was that the woman and child we had rescued were so weak they could not walk without rest, and we had no men to spare to carry them; the second that we came to an ideal spot to pass the night. It was, as usual, a deserted village through which ran a beautiful stream of water. Here we took possession of some outlying huts with a fence round them, and as Mavovo had managed to shoot a fat eland cow and her half-grown calf, we prepared to have a regular feast. Whilst Sammy was making some broth for the rescued woman, and Stephen and I smoked our pipes and watched him, Hans slipped through the broken gate of the thorn fence, or _boma_, and announced that Arabs were coming, two lots of them with many slaves.\n\n\nWe ran out to look and saw that, as he had said, two caravans were approaching, or rather had reached the village, but at some distance from us, and were now camping on what had once been the market-place. One of these was that whose track we had followed, although during the last few hours of our march we had struck away from it, chiefly because we could not bear such sights as I have described. It seemed to comprise about two hundred and fifty slaves and over forty guards, all black men carrying guns, and most of them by their dress Arabs, or bastard Arabs. In the second caravan, which approached from another direction, were not more than one hundred slaves and about twenty or thirty captors.\n\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d I said, \u201clet us eat our dinner and then, if you like, we will go to call upon those gentlemen, just to show that we are not afraid of them. Hans, get the flag and tie it to the top of that tree; it will show them to what country we belong.\u201d\n\n\nUp went the Union Jack duly, and presently through our glasses we saw the slavers running about in a state of excitement; also we saw the poor slaves turn and stare at the bit of flapping bunting and then begin to talk to each other. It struck me as possible that someone among their number had seen a Union Jack in the hands of an English traveller, or had heard of it as flying upon ships or at points on the coast, and what it meant to slaves. Or they may have understood some of the remarks of the Arabs, which no doubt were pointed and explanatory. At any rate, they turned and stared till the Arabs ran among them with sjambocks, that is, whips of hippopotamus hide, and suppressed their animated conversation with many blows.\n\n\nAt first I thought that they would break camp and march away; indeed, they began to make preparations to do this, then abandoned the idea, probably because the slaves were exhausted and there was no other water they could reach before nightfall. In the end they settled down and lit cooking fires. Also, as I observed, they took precautions against attack by stationing sentries and forcing the slaves to construct a _boma_ of thorns about their camp.\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Stephen, when we had finished our dinner, \u201care you ready for that call?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I answered, \u201cI do not think that I am. I have been considering things, and concluded that we had better leave well alone. By this time those Arabs will know all the story of our dealings with their worthy master, Hassan, for no doubt he has sent messengers to them. Therefore, if we go to their camp, they may shoot us at sight. Or, if they receive us well, they may offer hospitality and poison us, or cut our throats suddenly. Our position might be better, still it is one that I believe they would find difficult to take. So, in my opinion, we had better stop still and await developments.\u201d\n\n\nStephen grumbled something about my being over-cautious, but I took no heed of him. One thing I did do, however. Sending for Hans, I told him to take one of the Mazitu--I dared not risk them both for they were our guides--and another of the natives whom we had borrowed from Hassan, a bold fellow who knew all the local languages, and creep down to the slavers\u2019 camp as soon as it was quite dark. There I ordered him to find out what he could, and if possible to mix with the slaves and explain that we were their friends. Hans nodded, for this was exactly the kind of task that appealed to him, and went off to make his preparations.\n\n\nStephen and I also made some preparations in the way of strengthening our defences, building large watch-fires and setting sentries.\n\n\nThe night fell, and Hans with his companions departed stealthily as snakes. The silence was intense, save for the occasional wailings of the slaves, which now and again broke out in bursts of melancholy sound, \u201c_La-lu-La-lua!_\u201d and then died away, to be followed by horrid screams as the Arabs laid their lashes upon some poor wretch. Once too, a shot was fired.\n\n\n\u201cThey have seen Hans,\u201d said Stephen.\n\n\n\u201cI think not,\u201d I answered, \u201cfor if so there would have been more than one shot. Either it was an accident or they were murdering a slave.\u201d\n\n\nAfter this nothing more happened for a long while, till at length Hans seemed to rise out of the ground in front of me, and behind him I saw the figures of the Mazitu and the other man.\n\n\n\u201cTell your story,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cBaas, it is this. Between us we have learned everything. The Arabs know all about you and what men you have. Hassan has sent them orders to kill you. It is well that you did not go to visit them, for certainly you would have been murdered. We crept near and overheard their talk. They purpose to attack us at dawn to-morrow morning unless we leave this place before, which they will know of as we are being watched.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd if so, what then?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\u201cThen, Baas, they will attack as we are making up the caravan, or immediately afterwards as we begin to march.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIndeed. Anything more, Hans?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, Baas. These two men crept among the slaves and spoke with them. They are very sad, those slaves, and many of them have died of heart-pain because they have been taken from their homes and do not know where they are going. I saw one die just now; a young woman. She was talking to another woman and seemed quite well, only tired, till suddenly she said in a loud voice, \u2018I am going to die, that I may come back as a spirit and bewitch these devils till they are spirits too.\u2019 Then she called upon the fetish of her tribe, put her hands to her breast and fell down dead. At least,\u201d added Hans, spitting reflectively, \u201cshe did not fall quite down because the slave-stick held her head off the ground. The Arabs were very angry, both because she had cursed them and was dead. One of them came and kicked her body and afterwards shot her little boy who was sick, because the mother had cursed them. But fortunately he did not see us, because we were in the dark far from the fire.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnything more, Hans?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOne thing, Baas. These two men lent the knives you gave them to two of the boldest among the slaves that they might cut the cords of the slave-sticks and the other cords with which they were tied, and then pass them down the lines, that their brothers might do the same. But perhaps the Arabs will find it out, and then the Mazitu and the other must lose their knives. That is all. Has the Baas a little tobacco?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNow, Stephen,\u201d I said when Hans had gone and I had explained everything, \u201cthere are two courses open to us. Either we can try to give these gentlemen the slip at once, in which case we must leave the woman and child to their fate, or we can stop where we are and wait to be attacked.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t run,\u201d said Stephen sullenly; \u201cit would be cowardly to desert that poor creature. Also we should have a worse chance marching. Remember Hans said that they are watching us.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen you would wait to be attacked?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there a third alternative, Quatermain? To attack them?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d I said. \u201cLet us send for Mavovo.\u201d\n\n\nPresently he came and sat down in front of us, while I set out the case to him.\n\n\n\u201cIt is the fashion of my people to attack rather than to be attacked, and yet, my father, in this case my heart is against it. Hans\u201d (he called him _Inblatu_, a Zulu word which means Spotted Snake, that was the Hottentot\u2019s Kaffir name) \u201csays that there are quite sixty of the yellow dogs, all armed with guns, whereas we have not more than fifteen, for we cannot trust the slave men. Also he says that they are within a strong fence and awake, with spies out, so that it will be difficult to surprise them. But here, father, we are in a strong fence and cannot be surprised. Also men who torture and kill women and children, except in war must, I think, be cowards, and will come on faintly against good shooting, if indeed they come at all. Therefore, I say, \u2018Wait till the buffalo shall either charge or run.\u2019 But the word is with you, Macumazana, wise Watcher-by-Night, not with me, your hunter. Speak, you who are old in war, and I will obey.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou argue well,\u201d I answered; \u201calso another reason comes to my mind. Those Arab brutes may get behind the slaves, of whom we should butcher a lot without hurting them. Stephen, I think we had better see the thing through here.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll right, Quatermain. Only I hope that Mavovo is wrong in thinking that those blackguards may change their minds and run away.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally, young man, you are becoming very blood-thirsty--for an orchid grower,\u201d I remarked, looking at him. \u201cNow, for my part, I devoutly hope that Mavovo is right, for let me tell you, if he isn\u2019t it may be a nasty job.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been peaceful enough up to the present,\u201d replied Stephen. \u201cBut the sight of those unhappy wretches of slaves with their heads cut open, and of the woman tied to a tree to starve----\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMake you wish to usurp the functions of God Almighty,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, it is a natural impulse and perhaps, in the circumstances, one that will not displease Him. And now, as we have made up our minds what we are going to do, let\u2019s get to business so that these Arab gentlemen may find their breakfast ready when they come to call.\u201d",
    "Then it was that our real adventures began.\n\n\nOne evening, after three days\u2019 march through some difficult bush in which lions carried off a slave woman, killed one of the donkeys and mauled another so badly that it had to be shot, we found ourselves upon the edge of a great grassy plateau that, according to my aneroid, was 1,640 feet above sea level.\n\n\n\u201cWhat place is this?\u201d I asked of the two Mazitu guides, those same men whom we had borrowed from Hassan.\n\n\n\u201cThe land of our people, Chief,\u201d they answered, \u201cwhich is bordered on one side by the bush and on the other by the great lake where live the Pongo wizards.\u201d\n\n\nI looked about me at the bare uplands that already were beginning to turn brown, on which nothing was visible save vast herds of buck such as were common further south. A dreary prospect it was, for a slight rain was falling, accompanied by mist and a cold wind.\n\n\n\u201cI do not see your people or their kraals,\u201d I said; \u201cI only see grass and wild game.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOur people will come,\u201d they replied, rather nervously. \u201cNo doubt even now their spies watch us from among the tall grass or out of some hole.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe deuce they do,\u201d I said, or something like it, and thought no more of the matter. When one is in conditions in which anything _may_ happen, such as, so far as I am concerned, have prevailed through most of my life, one grows a little careless as to what _will_ happen. For my part I have long been a fatalist, to a certain extent. I mean I believe that the individual, or rather the identity which animates him, came out from the Source of all life a long while, perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago, and when his career is finished, perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of years hence, or perhaps to-morrow, will return perfected, but still as an individual, to dwell in or with that Source of Life. I believe also that his various existences, here or elsewhere, are fore-known and fore-ordained, although in a sense he may shape them by the action of his free will, and that nothing which he can do will lengthen or shorten one of them by a single hour. Therefore, so far as I am concerned, I have always acted up to the great injunction of our Master and taken no thought for the morrow.\n\n\nHowever, in this instance, as in many others of my experience, the morrow took plenty of thought for itself. Indeed, before the dawn, Hans, who never seemed really to sleep any more than a dog does, woke me up with the ominous information that he heard a sound which he thought was caused by the tramp of hundreds of marching men.\n\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d I asked, after listening without avail--to look was useless, for the night was dark as pitch.\n\n\nHe put his ear to the ground and said:\n\u201cThere.\u201d\n\n\nI put _my_ ear to the ground, but although my senses are fairly acute, could hear nothing.\n\n\nThen I sent for the sentries, but these, too, could hear nothing. After this I gave the business up and went to sleep again.\n\n\nHowever, as it proved, Hans was quite right; in such matters he generally was right, for his senses were as keen as those of any wild beast. At dawn I was once more awakened, this time by Mavovo, who reported that we were being surrounded by a regiment, or regiments. I rose and looked out through the mist. There, sure enough, in dim and solemn outline, though still far off, I perceived rank upon rank of men, armed men, for the light glimmered faintly upon their spears.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is to be done, Macumazana?\u201d asked Mavovo.\n\n\n\u201cHave breakfast, I think,\u201d I answered. \u201cIf we are going to be killed it may as well be after breakfast as before,\u201d and calling the trembling Sammy, I instructed him to make the coffee. Also I awoke Stephen and explained the situation to him.\n\n\n\u201cCapital!\u201d he answered. \u201cNo doubt these are the Mazitu, and we have found them much more easily than we expected. People generally take such a lot of hunting for in this confounded great country.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not such a bad way of looking at things,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut would you be good enough to go round the camp and make it clear that not on any account is anyone to fire without orders. Stay, collect all the guns from those slaves, for heaven knows what they will do with them if they are frightened!\u201d\n\n\nStephen nodded and sauntered off with three or four of the hunters. While he was gone, in consultation with Mavovo, I made certain little arrangements of my own, which need not be detailed. They were designed to enable us to sell our lives as dearly as possible, should things come to the worst. One should always try to make an impression upon the enemy in Africa, for the sake of future travellers if for no other reason.\n\n\nIn due course Stephen and the hunters returned with the guns, or most of them, and reported that the slave people were in a great state of terror, and showed a disposition to bolt.\n\n\n\u201cLet them bolt,\u201d I answered. \u201cThey would be of no use to us in a row and might even complicate matters. Call in the Zulus who are watching at once.\u201d\n\n\nHe nodded, and a few minutes later I heard--for the mist which hung about the bush to the east of the camp was still too dense to allow of my seeing anything--a clamour of voices, followed by the sound of scuttling feet. The slave people, including our bearers, had gone, every one of them. They even carried away the wounded. Just as the soldiers who surrounded us were completing their circle they bolted between the two ends of it and vanished into the bush out of which we had marched on the previous evening. Often since then I have wondered what became of them. Doubtless some perished, and the rest worked their way back to their homes or found new ones among other tribes. The experiences of those who escaped must be interesting to them if they still live. I can well imagine the legends in which these will be embodied two or three generations hence.\n\n\nDeducting the slave people and the bearers whom we had wrung out of Hassan, we were now a party of seventeen, namely eleven Zulu hunters including Mavovo, two white men, Hans and Sammy, and the two Mazitus who had elected to remain with us, while round us was a great circle of savages which closed in slowly.\n\n\nAs the light grew--it was long in coming on that dull morning--and the mist lifted, I examined these people, without seeming to take any particular notice of them. They were tall, much taller than the average Zulu, and slighter in their build, also lighter in colour. Like the Zulus they carried large hide shields and one very broad-bladed spear. Throwing assegais seemed to be wanting, but in place of them I saw that they were armed with short bows, which, together with a quiver of arrows, were slung upon their backs. The officers wore a short skin cloak or kaross, and the men also had cloaks, which I found out afterwards were made from the inner bark of trees.\n\n\nThey advanced in the most perfect silence and very slowly. Nobody said anything, and if orders were given this must have been done by signs. I could not see that any of them had firearms.\n\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d I said to Stephen, \u201cperhaps if we shot and killed some of those fellows, they might be frightened and run away. Or they might not; or if they did they might return.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhatever happened,\u201d he remarked sagely, \u201cwe should scarcely be welcome in their country afterwards, so I think we had better do nothing unless we are obliged.\u201d\n\n\nI nodded, for it was obvious that we could not fight hundreds of men, and told Sammy, who was perfectly livid with fear, to bring the breakfast. No wonder he was afraid, poor fellow, for we were in great danger. These Mazitu had a bad name, and if they chose to attack us we should all be dead in a few minutes.",
    "\u201cO Dogeetah and white lords,\u201d said Babemba, \u201cthe king invites your presence that he may ask your forgiveness for what has happened, and this time there will be no need for you to bring arms, since henceforward no hurt can come to you from the Mazitu people.\u201d\n\nSo presently we set out once more, taking with us the gifts that had been refused. Our march to the royal quarters was a veritable triumphal progress. The people prostrated themselves and clapped their hands slowly in salutation as we passed, while the girls and children pelted us with flowers as though we were brides going to be married. Our road ran by the place of execution where the stakes, at which I confess I looked with a shiver, were still standing, though the graves had been filled in.\n\nOn our arrival Bausi and his councillors rose and bowed to us. Indeed, the king did more, for coming forward he seized Brother John by the hand, and insisted upon rubbing his ugly black nose against that of this revered guest. This, it appeared, was the Mazitu method of embracing, an honour which Brother John did not seem at all to appreciate. Then followed long speeches, washed down with draughts of thick native beer. Bausi explained that his evil proceedings were entirely due to the wickedness of the deceased Imbozwi and his disciples, under whose tyranny the land had groaned for long, since the people believed them to speak \u201cwith the voice of \u2018Heaven Above.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrother John, on our behalf, accepted the apology, and then read a lecture, or rather preached a sermon, that took exactly twenty-five minutes to deliver (he is rather long in the wind), in which he demonstrated the evils of superstition and pointed to a higher and a better path. Bausi replied that he would like to hear more of that path another time which, as he presumed that we were going to spend the rest of our lives in his company, could easily be found--say during the next spring when the crops had been sown and the people had leisure on their hands.\n\nAfter this we presented our gifts, which now were eagerly accepted. Then I took up my parable and explained to Bausi that so far from stopping in Beza Town for the rest of our lives, we were anxious to press forward at once to Pongo-land. The king\u2019s face fell, as did those of his councillors.\n\n\u201cListen, O lord Macumazana, and all of you,\u201d he said. \u201cThese Pongo are horrible wizards, a great and powerful people who live by themselves amidst the swamps and mix with none. If the Pongo catch Mazitu or folk of any other tribe, either they kill them or take them as prisoners to their own land where they enslave them, or sometimes sacrifice them to the devils they worship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is so,\u201d broke in Babemba, \u201cfor when I was a lad I was a slave to the Pongo and doomed to be sacrificed to the White Devil. It was in escaping from them that I lost this eye.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, I made a note of this remark, though I did not think the moment opportune to follow the matter up. If Babemba has once been to Pongo-land, I reflected to myself, Babemba can go again or show us the way there.\n\n\u201cAnd if we catch any of the Pongo,\u201d went on Bausi, \u201cas sometimes we do when they come to hunt for slaves, we kill them. Ever since the Mazitu have been in this place there has been hate and war between them and the Pongo, and if I could wipe out those evil ones, then I should die happily.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you will never do, O King, while the White Devil lives,\u201d said Babemba. \u201cHave you not heard the Pongo prophecy, that while the White Devil lives and the Holy Flower blooms, they will live. But when the White Devil dies and the Holy Flower ceases to bloom, then their women will become barren and their end will be upon them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose that this White Devil will die some day,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNot so, Macumazana. It will never die of itself. Like its wicked Priest, it has been there from the beginning and will always be there unless it is killed. But who is there that can kill the White Devil?\u201d\n\nI thought to myself that I would not mind trying, but again I did not pursue the point.\n\n\u201cMy brother Dogeetah and lords,\u201d exclaimed Bausi, \u201cit is not possible that you should visit these wizards except at the head of an army. But how can I send an army with you, seeing that the Mazitu are a land people and have no canoes in which to cross the great lake, and no trees whereof to make them?\u201d\n\nWe answered that we did not know but would think the matter over, as we had come from our own place for this purpose and meant to carry it out.\n\nThen the audience came to an end, and we returned to our huts, leaving Dogeetah to converse with his \u201cbrother Bausi\u201d on matters connected with the latter\u2019s health. As I passed Babemba I told him that I should like to see him alone, and he said that he would visit me that evening after supper. The rest of the day passed quietly, for we had asked that people might be kept away from our encampment.\n\n\nWe found Hans, who had not accompanied us, being a little shy of appearing in public just then, engaged in cleaning the rifles, and this reminded me of something. Taking the double-barrelled gun of which I have spoken, I called Mavovo and handed it to him, saying:\n\n\u201cIt is yours, O true prophet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my father,\u201d he answered, \u201cit is mine for a little while, then perhaps it will be yours again.\u201d\n\nThe words struck me, but I did not care to ask their meaning. Somehow I wanted to hear no more of Mavovo\u2019s prophecies.\n\nThen we dined, and for the rest of that afternoon slept, for all of us, including Brother John, needed rest badly. In the evening Babemba came, and we three white men saw him alone.\n\n\u201cTell us about the Pongo and this white devil they worship,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cMacumazana,\u201d he answered, \u201cfifty years have gone by since I was in that land and I see things that happened to me there as through a mist. I went to fish amongst the reeds when I was a boy of twelve, and tall men robed in white came in a canoe and seized me. They led me to a town where there were many other such men, and treated me very well, giving me sweet things to eat till I grew fat and my skin shone. Then in the evening I was taken away, and we marched all night to the mouth of a great cave. In this cave sat a horrible old man about whom danced robed people, performing the rites of the White Devil.\n\nThe old man told me that on the following morning I was to be cooked and eaten, for which reason I had been made so fat. There was a canoe at the mouth of the cave, beyond which lay water. While all were asleep I crept to the canoe. As I loosed the rope one of the priests woke up and ran at me. But I hit him on the head with the paddle, for though only a boy I was bold and strong, and he fell into the water. He came up again and gripped the edge of the canoe, but I struck his fingers with the paddle till he let go. A great wind was blowing that night, tearing off boughs from the trees which grew upon the other shore of the water. It whirled the canoe round and round and one of the boughs struck me in the eye. I scarcely felt it at the time, but afterwards the eye withered. Or perhaps it was a spear or a knife that struck me in the eye, I do not know. I paddled till I lost my senses and always that wind blew. The last thing that I remember was the sound of the canoe being driven by the gale through reeds. When I woke up again I found myself near a shore, to which I waded through the mud, scaring great crocodiles. But this must have been some days later, for now I was quite thin. I fell down upon the shore, and there some of our people found me and nursed me till I recovered. That is all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd quite enough too,\u201d I said. \u201cNow answer me. How far was the town from the place where you were captured in Mazitu-land?\u201d\n\n\u201cA whole day\u2019s journey in the canoe, Macumazana. I was captured in the morning early and we reached the harbour in the evening at a place where many canoes were tied up, perhaps fifty of them, some of which would hold forty men.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how far was the town from this harbour?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite close, Macumazana.\u201d\n\nNow Brother John asked a question.\n\n\u201cDid you hear anything about the land beyond the water by the cave?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Dogeetah. I heard then, or afterwards--for from time to time rumours reach us concerning these Pongo--that it is an island where grows the Holy Flower, of which you know, for when last you were here you had one of its blooms. I heard, too, that this Holy Flower was tended by a priestess named Mother of the Flower, and her servants, all of whom were virgins.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was the priestess?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know, but I have heard that she was one of those people who, although their parents are black, are born white, and that if any females among the Pongo are born white, or with pink eyes, or deaf and dumb, they are set apart to be the servants of the priestess. But this priestess must now be dead, seeing that when I was a boy she was already old, very, very old, and the Pongo were much concerned because there was no one of white skin who could be appointed to succeed her. Indeed she _is_ dead, since many years ago there was a great feast in Pongo-land and numbers of slaves were eaten, because the priests had found a beautiful new princess who was white with yellow hair and had finger-nails of the right shape.\u201d\n\nNow I bethought me that this finding of the priestess named \u201cMother of the Flower,\u201d who must be distinguished by certain personal peculiarities, resembled not a little that of the finding of the Apis bull-god, which also must have certain prescribed and holy markings, by the old Egyptians, as narrated by Herodotus. However, I said nothing about it at the time, because Brother John asked sharply:\n\n\u201cAnd is this priestess also dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know, Dogeetah, but I think not. If she were dead I think that we should have heard some rumour of the Feast of the eating of the dead Mother.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEating the dead mother!\u201d I exclaimed.\n\n\u201cYes, Macumazana. It is the law among the Pongo that, for a certain sacred reason, the body of the Mother of the Flower, when she dies, must be partaken of by those who are privileged to the holy food.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the White Devil neither dies nor is eaten?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo, as I have told you, he never dies. It is he who causes others to die, as if you go to Pongo-land doubtless you will find out,\u201d Babemba added grimly.\n\n\nUpon my word, thought I to myself, as the meeting broke up because Babemba had nothing more to say, if I had my way I would leave Pongo-land and its white devil alone. Then I remembered how Brother John stood in reference to this matter, and with a sigh resigned myself to fate. As it proved it, I mean Fate, was quite equal to the occasion. The very next morning, early, Babemba turned up again.\n\n\u201cLords, lords,\u201d he said, \u201ca wonderful thing has happened! Last night we spoke of the Pongo and now behold! an embassy from the Pongo is here; it arrived at sunrise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cTo propose peace between their people and the Mazitu. Yes, they ask that Bausi should send envoys to their town to arrange a lasting peace. As if anyone would go!\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cPerhaps some might dare to,\u201d I answered, for an idea occurred to me, \u201cbut let us go to see Bausi.\u201d\n\nHalf an hour later we were seated in the king\u2019s enclosure, that is, Stephen and I were, for Brother John was already in the royal hut, talking to Bausi. As we went a few words had passed between us.\n\n\u201cHas it occurred to you, John,\u201d I asked, \u201cthat if you really wish to visit Pongo-land here is perhaps what you would call a providential opportunity. Certainly none of these Mazitu will go, since they fear lest they should find a permanent peace--inside of the Pongo. Well, you are a blood-brother to Bausi and can offer to play the part of Envoy Extraordinary, with us as the members of your staff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have already thought of it, Allan,\u201d he replied, stroking his long beard.\n\nWe sat down among a few of the leading councillors, and presently Bausi came out of his hut accompanied by Brother John, and having greeted us, ordered the Pongo envoys to be admitted.",
    "Reaching a kind of wharf which was protected from erosion by piles formed of small trees driven into the mud, to which were tied a fleet of canoes, we landed just as the sun was beginning to sink. Our approach had doubtless been observed, for as we drew near the wharf a horn was blown by someone on the shore, whereon a considerable number of men appeared, I suppose, out of the huts, and assisted to make the canoe fast. I noted that these all resembled Komba and his companions in build and features; they were so like each other that, except for the difference of their ages, it was difficult to tell them apart. They might all have been members of one family; indeed, this was practically the case, owing to constant intermarriage carried on for generations.\n\nThere was something in the appearance of these tall, cold, sharp-featured, white-robed men that chilled my blood, something unnatural and almost inhuman. Here was nothing of the usual African jollity. No one shouted, no one laughed or chattered. No one crowded on us, trying to handle our persons or clothes. No one appeared afraid or even astonished. Except for a word or two they were silent, merely contemplating us in a chilling and distant fashion, as though the arrival of three white men in a country where before no white man had ever set foot were an everyday occurrence.\n\nMoreover, our personal appearance did not seem to impress them, for they smiled faintly at Brother John\u2019s long beard and at my stubbly hair, pointing these out to each other with their slender fingers or with the handles of their big spears. I remarked that they never used the blade of the spear for this purpose, perhaps because they thought that we might take this for a hostile or even a warlike demonstration. It is humiliating to have to add that the only one of our company who seemed to move them to wonder or interest was Hans. His extremely ugly and wrinkled countenance, it was clear, did appeal to them to some extent, perhaps because they had never seen anything in the least like it before, or perhaps for another reason which the reader may guess in due course.\n\nAt any rate, I heard one of them, pointing to Hans, ask Komba whether the ape-man was our god or only our captain. The compliment seemed to please Hans, who hitherto had never been looked on either as a god or a captain. But the rest of us were not flattered; indeed, Mavovo was indignant, and told Hans outright that if he heard any more such talk he would beat him before these people, to show them that he was neither a captain nor a god.\n\n\u201cWait till I claim to be either, O butcher of a Zulu, before you threaten to treat me thus!\u201d ejaculated Hans, indignantly. Then he added, with his peculiar Hottentot snigger, \u201cStill, it is true that before all the meat is eaten (i.e. before all is done) you may think me both,\u201d a dark saying which at the time we did not understand.\n\nWhen we had landed and collected our belongings, Komba told us to follow him, and led us up a wide street that was very tidily kept and bordered on either side by the large huts whereof I have spoken. Each of these huts stood in a fenced garden of its own, a thing I have rarely seen elsewhere in Africa. The result of this arrangement was that although as a matter of fact it had but a comparatively small population, the area covered by Rica was very great. The town, by the way, was not surrounded with any wall or other fortification, which showed that the inhabitants feared no attack. The waters of the lake were their defence.\n\nFor the rest, the chief characteristic of this place was the silence that brooded there. Apparently they kept no dogs, for none barked, and no poultry, for I never heard a cock crow in Pongo-land. Cattle and native sheep they had in abundance, but as they did not fear any enemy, these were pastured outside the town, their milk and meat being brought in as required. A considerable number of people were gathered to observe us, not in a crowd, but in little family groups which collected separately at the gates of the gardens.\n\nFor the most part these consisted of a man and one or more wives, finely formed and handsome women. Sometimes they had children with them, but these were very few; the most I saw with any one family was three, and many seemed to possess none at all. Both the women and the children, like the men, were decently clothed in long, white garments, another peculiarity which showed that these natives were no ordinary African savages.\n\nOh! I can see Rica Town now after all these many years: the wide street swept and garnished, the brown-roofed, white-walled huts in their fertile, irrigated gardens, the tall, silent folk, the smoke from the cooking fires rising straight as a line in the still air, the graceful palms and other tropical trees, and at the head of the street, far away to the north, the rounded, towering shape of the forest-clad mountain that was called House of the Gods. Often that vision comes back to me in my sleep, or at times in my waking hours when some heavy odour reminds me of the overpowering scent of the great trumpet-like blooms which hung in profusion upon broad-leaved bushes that were planted in almost every garden.\n\nOn we marched till at last we reached a tall, live fence that was covered with brilliant scarlet flowers, arriving at its gate just as the last red glow of day faded from the sky and night began to fall. Komba pushed open the gate, revealing a scene that none of us are likely to forget. The fence enclosed about an acre of ground of which the back part was occupied by two large huts standing in the usual gardens.\n\nIn front of these, not more than fifteen paces from the gate, stood another building of a totally different character. It was about fifty feet in length by thirty broad and consisted only of a roof supported upon carved pillars of wood, the spaces between the pillars being filled with grass mats or blinds. Most of these blinds were pulled down, but four exactly opposite the gate were open. Inside the shed forty or fifty men, who wore white robes and peculiar caps and who were engaged in chanting a dreadful, melancholy song, were gathered on three sides of a huge fire that burned in a pit in the ground. On the fourth side, that facing the gate, a man stood alone with his arms outstretched and his back towards us.\n\nOf a sudden he heard our footsteps and turned round, springing to the left, so that the light might fall on us. Now we saw by the glow of the great fire, that over it was an iron grid not unlike a small bedstead, and that on this grid lay some fearful object. Stephen, who was a little ahead, stared, then exclaimed in a horrified voice:\n\n\u201cMy God! it is a woman!\u201d\n\nIn another second the blinds fell down, hiding everything, and the singing ceased.",
    "Still in the midst of an intense silence, the Motombo glared at the prostrate figure of the Kalubi. For a long while he glared. Then the silence was broken, for the wretched Kalubi sprang from the floor, seized a spear and tried to kill himself. Before the blade touched him it was snatched from his hand, so that he remained standing, but weaponless.\n\nAgain there was silence and again it was broken, this time by the Motombo, who rose from his seat before which he stood, a huge, bloated object, and roared aloud in his rage. Yes, he roared like a wounded buffalo. Never would I have believed that such a vast volume of sound could have proceeded from the lungs of a single aged man. For fully a minute his furious bellowings echoed down that great cave, while all the Pongo soldiers, rising from their recumbent position, pointed their hands, in some of which torches still burned, at the miserable Kalubi on whom their wrath seemed to be concentrated, rather than on us, and hissed like snakes.\n\nReally it might have been a scene in hell with the Motombo playing the part of Satan. Indeed, his swollen, diabolical figure supported on the thin, toad-like legs, the great fires burning on either side, the lurid lights of evening reflected from the still water beyond and glowering among the tree tops of the mountain, the white-robed forms of the tall Pongo, bending, every one of them, towards the wretched culprit and hissing like so many fierce serpents, all suggested some uttermost deep in the infernal regions as one might conceive them in a nightmare.\n\nIt went on for some time, I don\u2019t know how long, till at length the Motombo picked up his fantastically shaped horn and blew. Thereon the women darted from the various doorways, but seeing that they were not wanted, checked themselves in their stride and remained standing so, in the very attitude of runners about to start upon a race. As the blast of the horn died away the turmoil was suddenly succeeded by an utter stillness, broken only by the crackling of the fires whose flames, of all the living things in that place, alone seemed heedless of the tragedy which was being played.\n\n\u201cAll up now, old fellow!\u201d whispered Stephen to me in a shaky voice.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, \u201call up high as heaven, where I hope we are going. Now back to back, and let\u2019s make the best fight we can. We\u2019ve got the spears.\u201d\n\nWhile we were closing in the Motombo began to speak.\n\n\u201cSo you plotted to kill the god, Kalubi-who-_was_,\u201d he screamed, \u201cwith these white ones whom you would pay with the Holy Flower and her who guards it. Good! You shall go, all of you, and talk with the god. And I, watching here, will learn who dies--you or the god. Away with them!\u201d\n\nWith a roar the Pongo soldiers leapt on us. I think that Mavovo managed to get his spear up and kill a man, for I saw one of them fall backwards and lie still. But they were too quick for the rest of us. In half a minute we were seized, the spears were wrenched from our hands and we were thrown headlong into the canoe, all six of us, or rather seven including the Kalubi. A number of the soldiers, including Komba, who acted as steersman, also sprang into the canoe that was instantly pushed out from beneath the bridge or platform on which the Motombo sat and down the little creek into the still water of the canal or estuary, or whatever it may be, that separates the wall of rock which the cave pierces from the base of the mountain.\n\nAs we floated out of the mouth of the cave the toad-like Motombo, who had wheeled round upon his stool, shouted an order to Komba.\n\n\u201cO Kalubi,\u201d he said, \u201cset the Kalubi-who-_was_ and the three white men and their three servants on the borders of the forest that is named House-of-the-god and leave them there. Then return and depart, for here I would watch alone. When all is finished I will summon you.\u201d\n\nKomba bowed his handsome head and at a sign two of the men got out paddles, for more were not needed, and with slow and gentle strokes rowed us across the water. The first thing I noted about this water at the time was that its blackness was inky, owing, I suppose, to its depth and the shadows of the towering cliff on one side and of the tall trees on the other. Also I observed--for in this emergency, or perhaps because of it, I managed to keep my wits about me--that its banks on either side were the home of great numbers of crocodiles which lay there like logs. I saw, further, that a little lower down where the water seemed to narrow, jagged boughs projected from its surface as though great trees had fallen, or been thrown into it. I recalled in a numb sort of way that old Babemba had told us that when he was a boy he had escaped in a canoe down this estuary, and reflected that it would not be possible for him to do so now because of those snags. Unless, indeed, he had floated over them in a time of great flood.\n\nA couple of minutes or so of paddling brought us to the further shore which, as I think I have said, was only about two hundred yards from the mouth of the cave. The bow of the canoe grated on the bank, disturbing a huge crocodile that vanished into the depths with an angry plunge.\n\n\u201cLand, white lords, land,\u201d said Komba with the utmost politeness, \u201cand go, visit the god who doubtless is waiting for you. And now, as we shall meet no more--farewell. You are wise and I am foolish, yet hearken to my counsel. If ever you should return to the Earth again, be advised by me. Cling to your own god if you have one, and do not meddle with those of other peoples. Again farewell.\u201d\n\n\nThe advice was excellent, but at that moment I felt a hate for Komba which was really superhuman. To me even the Motombo seemed an angel of light as compared with him. If wishes could have killed, our farewell would indeed have been complete.\n\nThen, admonished by the spear points of the Pongo, we landed in the slimy mud. Brother John went first with a smile upon his handsome countenance that I thought idiotic under the circumstances, though doubtless he knew best when he ought to smile, and the wretched Kalubi came last. Indeed, so great was his shrinking from that ominous shore, that I believe he was ultimately propelled from the boat by his successor in power, Komba. Once he had trodden it, however, a spark of spirit returned to him, for he wheeled round and said to Komba,\n\n\u201cRemember, O Kalubi, that my fate to-day will be yours also in a day to come. The god wearies of his priests. This year, next year, or the year after; he always wearies of his priests.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, O Kalubi-that-was,\u201d answered Komba in a mocking voice as the canoe was pushed off, \u201cpray to the god for me, that it may be the year after; pray it as your bones break in his embrace.\u201d",
    "The two women, who had risen from their knees, stared at me as though they saw a ghost.\n\n\u201cLadies,\u201d I said, bowing, \u201cpray do not be alarmed. You see God Almighty sometimes answers prayers. In short, I am one of--a party--of white people who, with some trouble, have succeeded in getting to this place and--and--would you allow us to call on you?\u201d\n\nStill they stared. At length the elder woman opened her lips.\n\n\u201cHere I am called the Mother of the Holy Flower, and for a stranger to speak with the Mother is death. Also if you are a man, how did you reach us alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long story,\u201d I answered cheerfully. \u201cMay we come in? We will take the risks, we are accustomed to them and hope to be able to do you a service. I should explain that three of us are white men, two English and one--American.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican!\u201d she gasped, \u201cAmerican! What is he like, and how is he named?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d I replied, for my nerve was giving out and I grew confused, \u201che is oldish, with a white beard, rather like Father Christmas in short, and his Christian name (I didn\u2019t dare to give it all at once) is--er--John, Brother John, we call him. Now I think of it,\u201d I added, \u201che has some resemblance to your companion there.\u201d\n\n\nI thought that the lady was going to die, and cursed myself for my awkwardness. She flung her arm about the girl to save herself from falling--a poor prop, for she, too, looked as though she were going to die, having understood some, if not all, of my talk. It must be remembered that this poor young thing had never even seen a white man before.\n\n\u201cMadam, madam,\u201d I expostulated, \u201cI pray you to bear up. After living through so much sorrow it would be foolish to decease of--joy. May I call in Brother John? He is a clergyman and might be able to say something appropriate, which I, who am only a hunter, cannot do.\u201d\n\nShe gathered herself together, opened her eyes and whispered:\n\n\u201cSend him here.\u201d\n\nI pushed open the gate behind which the others were clustered. Catching Brother John, who by now had recovered somewhat, by the arm, I dragged him forward. The two stood staring at each other, and the young lady also looked with wide eyes and open mouth.\n\n\u201cElizabeth!\u201d said John.\n\nShe uttered a faint scream, then with a cry of \u201c_Husband!_\u201d flung herself upon his breast.\n\nI slipped through the gate and shut it fast.\n\n\n\n\u201cI say, Allan,\u201d said Stephen, when we had retreated to a little distance, \u201cdid you see her?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer? Who? Which?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThe young lady in the white clothes. She is lovely.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold your tongue, you donkey!\u201d I answered. \u201cIs this a time to talk of female looks?\u201d\n\nThen I went away behind the wall and literally wept for joy. It was one of the happiest moments of my life, for how seldom things happen as they should!\n\nAlso I wanted to put up a little prayer of my own, a prayer of thankfulness and for strength and wit to overcome the many dangers that yet awaited us.",
    "Next we went to the enclosure, where Mrs. Eversley with a native knife cut a string of palm fibres that was sealed with clay on to the door and one of its uprights in such a fashion that none could enter without breaking the string. The impression was made with a rude seal that she wore round her neck as a badge of office. It was a very curious object fashioned of gold and having deeply cut upon its face a rough image of an ape holding a flower in its right paw. As it was also ancient, this seemed to show that the monkey god and the orchid had been from the beginning jointly worshipped by the Pongo.\n\nWhen she had opened the door, there appeared, growing in the centre of the enclosure, the most lovely plant, I should imagine, that man ever saw. It measured some eight feet across, and the leaves were dark green, long and narrow. From its various crowns rose the scapes of bloom. And oh! those blooms, of which there were about twelve, expanded now in the flowering season. The measurements made from the dried specimen I have given already, so I need not repeat them. I may say here, however, that the Pongo augured the fertility or otherwise of each succeeding year from the number of the blooms on the Holy Flower. If these were many the season would prove very fruitful; if few, less so; while if, as sometimes happened, the plant failed to flower, drought and famine were always said to follow. Truly those were glorious blossoms, standing as high as a man, with their back sheaths of vivid white barred with black, their great pouches of burnished gold and their wide wings also of gold. Then in the centre of each pouch appeared the ink-mark that did indeed exactly resemble the head of a monkey. But if this orchid astonished me, its effect upon Stephen, with whom this class of flower was a mania, may be imagined. Really he went almost mad. For a long while he glared at the plant, and finally flung himself upon his knees, causing Miss Hope to exclaim:\n\n\u201cWhat, O Stephen Somers! do you also make sacrifice to the Holy Flower?\u201d\n\n\u201cRather,\u201d he answered; \u201cI\u2019d--I\u2019d--die for it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are likely to before all is done,\u201d I remarked with energy, for I hate to see a grown man make a fool of himself. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing in the world which justifies _that_, and it isn\u2019t a flower.\u201d\n\nMavovo and Hans had followed us into the enclosure, and I overheard a conversation between them which amused me. The gist of it was that Hans explained to Mavovo that the white people admired this weed--he called it a weed--because it was like gold, which was the god they really worshipped, although that god was known among them by many names. Mavovo, who was not at all interested in the affair, replied with a shrug that it might be so, though for his part he believed the true reason to be that the plant produced some medicine which gave courage or strength. Zulus, I may say, do not care for flowers unless they bear a fruit that is good to eat.\n\nWhen I had satisfied myself with the splendour of these magnificent blooms, I asked Mrs. Eversley what certain little mounds might be that were dotted about the enclosure, beyond the circle of cultivated peaty soil which surrounded the orchid\u2019s roots.\n\n\u201cThey are the graves of the Mothers of the Holy Flower,\u201d she answered. \u201cThere are twelve of them, and here is the spot chosen for the thirteenth, which was to have been mine.\u201d\n\nTo change the subject I asked another question, namely: If there were more such orchids growing in the country?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, \u201cor at least I never heard of any. Indeed, I have always been told that this one was brought from far away generations ago. Also, under an ancient law, it is never allowed to increase. Any shoots it sends up beyond this ring must be cut off by me and destroyed with certain ceremonies. You see that seed-pod which has been left to grow on the stalk of one of last year\u2019s blooms. It is now ripe, and on the night of the next new moon, when the Kalubi comes to visit me, I must with much ritual burn it in his presence, unless it has burst before he arrives, in which case I must burn any seedlings that may spring up with almost the same ritual.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Kalubi will come any more; at least, not while you are here. Indeed, I am sure of it,\u201d I said.\n\nAs we were leaving the place, acting on my general principle of making sure of anything of value when I get the chance, I broke off that ripe seed-pod, which was of the size of an orange. No one was looking at the time, and as it went straight into my pocket, no one missed it.\n\nThen, leaving Stephen and the young lady to admire this Cypripedium--or each other--in the enclosure, we three elders returned to the house to discuss matters.",
    "When the breeze failed us at last we were perhaps something over three miles from the shore, or rather from the great bed of reeds which at this spot grow in the shallows off the Mazitu coast to a breadth of seven or eight hundred yards, where the water becomes too deep for them.\nThe Pongos were then about a mile and a half behind. But as the wind favoured them for a few minutes more and, having plenty of hands, they could help themselves on by paddling, when at last it died to a complete calm, the distance between us was not more than one mile. This meant that they must cover four miles of water, while we covered three.\n\nLetting down our now useless sail and throwing it and the mast overboard to lighten the canoe, since the sky showed us that there was no more hope of wind, we began to paddle as hard as we could. Fortunately the two ladies were able to take their share in this exercise, since they had learned it upon the Lake of the Flower, where it seemed they kept a private canoe upon the other side of the island which was used for fishing. Hans, who was still weak, we set to steer with a paddle aft, which he did in a somewhat erratic fashion.\n\nA stern chase is proverbially a long chase, but still the enemy with their skilled rowers came up fast. When we were a mile from the reeds they were within half a mile of us, and as we tired the proportion of distance lessened. When we were two hundred yards from the reeds they were not more than fifty or sixty yards behind, and then the real struggle began.\n\nIt was short but terrible. We threw everything we could overboard, including the ballast stones at the bottom of the canoe and the heavy hide of the gorilla. This, as it proved, was fortunate, since the thing sank but slowly and the foremost Pongo boats halted a minute to recover so precious a relic, checking the others behind them, a circumstance that helped us by twenty or thirty yards.\n\n\u201cOver with the plant!\u201d I said.\n\nBut Stephen, looking quite old from exhaustion and with the sweat streaming from him as he laboured at his unaccustomed paddle, gasped:\n\n\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, no, after all we have gone through to get it.\u201d\n\nSo I didn\u2019t insist; indeed there was neither time nor breath for argument.\n\nNow we were in the reeds, for thanks to the flag which guided us, we had struck the big hippopotamus lane exactly, and the Pongos, paddling like demons, were about thirty yards behind. Thankful was I that those interesting people had never learned the use of bows and arrows, and that their spears were too heavy to throw. By now, or rather some time before, old Babemba and the Mazitu had seen us, as had our Zulu hunters.\nCrowds of them were wading through the shallows towards us, yelling encouragements as they came. The Zulus, too, opened a rather wild fire, with the result that one of the bullets struck our canoe and another touched the brim of my hat. A third, however, killed a Pongo, which caused some confusion in the ranks of Tusculum.\n\nBut we were done and they came on remorselessly. When their leading boat was not more than ten yards from us and we were perhaps two hundred from the shore, I drove my paddle downwards and finding that the water was less than four feet deep, shouted:\n\n\u201cOverboard, all, and wade. It\u2019s our last chance!\u201d\n\nWe scrambled out of that canoe the prow of which, as I left it the last, I pushed round across the water-lane to obstruct those of the Pongo. Now I think all would have gone well had it not been for Stephen, who after he had floundered forward a few paces in the mud, bethought him of his beloved orchid. Not only did he return to try to rescue it, he also actually persuaded his friend Mavovo to accompany him. They got back to the boat and began to lift the plant out when the Pongo fell upon them, striking at them with their spears over the width of our canoe. Mavovo struck back with the weapon he had taken from the Pongo sentry at the cave mouth, and killed or wounded one of them. Then some one hurled a ballast stone at him which caught him on the side of the head and knocked him down into the water, whence he rose and reeled back, almost senseless, till some of our people got hold of him and dragged him to the shore.\n\nSo Stephen was left alone, dragging at the great orchid, till a Pongo reaching over the canoe drove a spear through his shoulder. He let go of the orchid because he must and tried to retreat. Too late! Half a dozen or more of the Pongo pushed themselves between the stern or bow of our canoe and the reeds, and waded forward to kill him. I could not help, for to tell the truth at the moment I was stuck in a mud-hole made by the hoof of a hippopotamus, while the Zulu hunters and the Mazitu were as yet too far off. Surely he must have died had it not been for the courage of the girl Hope, who, while wading shorewards a little in front of me, had turned and seen his plight. Back she came, literally bounding through the water like a leopard whose cubs are in danger.\n\nReaching Stephen before the Pongo she thrust herself between him and them and proceeded to address them with the utmost vigour in their own language, which of course she had learned from those of the albinos who were not mutes.\n\nWhat she said I could not exactly catch because of the shouts of the advancing Mazitu. I gathered, however, that she was anathematizing them in the words of some old and potent curse that was only used by the guardians of the Holy Flower, which consigned them, body and spirit, to a dreadful doom. The effect of this malediction, which by the way neither the young lady nor her mother would repeat to me afterwards, was certainly remarkable. Those men who heard it, among them the would-be slayers of Stephen, stayed their hands and even inclined their heads towards the young priestess, as though in reverence or deprecation, and thus remained for sufficient time for her to lead the wounded Stephen out of danger. This she did wading backwards by his side and keeping her eyes fixed full upon the Pongo. It was perhaps the most curious rescue that I ever saw.\n\nThe Holy Flower, I should add, they recaptured and carried off, for I saw it departing in one of their canoes. That was the end of my orchid hunt and of the money which I hoped to make by the sale of this floral treasure. I wonder what became of it. I have good reason to believe that it was never replanted on the Island of the Flower, so perhaps it was borne back to the dim and unknown land in the depths of Africa whence the Pongo are supposed to have brought it when they migrated."

  "Rafael Sabatini -- Scaramouche: A Romance of the French Revolution": [
    "He was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad. And that was all his patrimony. His very paternity was obscure, although the village of Gavrillac had long since dispelled the cloud of mystery that hung about it. Those simple Brittany folk were not so simple as to be deceived by a pretended relationship which did not even possess the virtue of originality. When a nobleman, for no apparent reason, announces himself the godfather of an infant fetched no man knew whence, and thereafter cares for the lad's rearing and education, the most unsophisticated of country folk perfectly understand the situation. And so the good people of Gavrillac permitted themselves no illusions on the score of the real relationship between Andre-Louis Moreau--as the lad had been named--and Quintin de Kercadiou, Lord of Gavrillac, who dwelt in the big grey house that dominated from its eminence the village clustering below.\n\n\nAndre-Louis had learnt his letters at the village school, lodged the while with old Rabouillet, the attorney, who in the capacity of fiscal intendant, looked after the affairs of M. de Kercadiou. Thereafter, at the age of fifteen, he had been packed off to Paris, to the Lycee of Louis Le Grand, to study the law which he was now returned to practise in conjunction with Rabouillet. All this at the charges of his godfather, M. de Kercadiou, who by placing him once more under the tutelage of Rabouillet would seem thereby quite clearly to be making provision for his future.\n\n\nAndre-Louis, on his side, had made the most of his opportunities. You behold him at the age of four-and-twenty stuffed with learning enough to produce an intellectual indigestion in an ordinary mind. Out of his zestful study of Man, from Thucydides to the Encyclopaedists, from Seneca to Rousseau, he had confirmed into an unassailable conviction his earliest conscious impressions of the general insanity of his own species. Nor can I discover that anything in his eventful life ever afterwards caused him to waver in that opinion.\n\n\nIn body he was a slight wisp of a fellow, scarcely above middle height, with a lean, astute countenance, prominent of nose and cheek-bones, and with lank, black hair that reached almost to his shoulders. His mouth was long, thin-lipped, and humorous. He was only just redeemed from ugliness by the splendour of a pair of ever-questing, luminous eyes, so dark as to be almost black. Of the whimsical quality of his mind and his rare gift of graceful expression, his writings--unfortunately but too scanty--and particularly his Confessions, afford us very ample evidence. Of his gift of oratory he was hardly conscious yet, although he had already achieved a certain fame for it in the Literary Chamber of Rennes--one of those clubs by now ubiquitous in the land, in which the intellectual youth of France foregathered to study and discuss the new philosophies that were permeating social life. But the fame he had acquired there was hardly enviable. He was too impish, too caustic, too much disposed--so thought his colleagues--to ridicule their sublime theories for the regeneration of mankind. Himself he protested that he merely held them up to the mirror of truth, and that it was not his fault if when reflected there they looked ridiculous.\n\n\nAll that he achieved by this was to exasperate; and his expulsion from a society grown mistrustful of him must already have followed but for his friend, Philippe de Vilmorin, a divinity student of Rennes, who, himself, was one of the most popular members of the Literary Chamber.\n\n\nComing to Gavrillac on a November morning, laden with news of the political storms which were then gathering over France, Philippe found in that sleepy Breton village matter to quicken his already lively indignation. A peasant of Gavrillac, named Mabey, had been shot dead that morning in the woods of Meupont, across the river, by a gamekeeper of the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr. The unfortunate fellow had been caught in the act of taking a pheasant from a snare, and the gamekeeper had acted under explicit orders from his master.\n\n\nInfuriated by an act of tyranny so absolute and merciless, M. de Vilmorin proposed to lay the matter before M. de Kercadiou. Mabey was a vassal of Gavrillac, and Vilmorin hoped to move the Lord of Gavrillac to demand at least some measure of reparation for the widow and the three orphans which that brutal deed had made.\n\n\nBut because Andre-Louis was Philippe's dearest friend--indeed, his almost brother--the young seminarist sought him out in the first instance. He found him at breakfast alone in the long, low-ceilinged, white-panelled dining-room at Rabouillet's--the only home that Andre-Louis had ever known--and after embracing him, deafened him with his denunciation of M. de La Tour d'Azyr.\n\n\n\"I have heard of it already,\" said Andre-Louis.\n\n\n\"You speak as if the thing had not surprised you,\" his friend reproached him.\n\n\n\"Nothing beastly can surprise me when done by a beast. And La Tour d'Azyr is a beast, as all the world knows. The more fool Mabey for stealing his pheasants. He should have stolen somebody else's.\"\n\n\n\"Is that all you have to say about it?\"\n\n\n\"What more is there to say? I've a practical mind, I hope.\"\n\n\n\"What more there is to say I propose to say to your godfather, M. de Kercadiou. I shall appeal to him for justice.\"\n\n\n\"Against M. de La Tour d'Azyr?\" Andre-Louis raised his eyebrows.\n\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\n\"My dear ingenuous Philippe, dog doesn't eat dog.\"\n\n\n\"You are unjust to your godfather. He is a humane man.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, as humane as you please. But this isn't a question of humanity. It's a question of game-laws.\"\n\n\nM. de Vilmorin tossed his long arms to Heaven in disgust. He was a tall, slender young gentleman, a year or two younger than Andre-Louis. He was very soberly dressed in black, as became a seminarist, with white bands at wrists and throat and silver buckles to his shoes. His neatly clubbed brown hair was innocent of powder.\n\n\n\"You talk like a lawyer,\" he exploded.\n\n\n\"Naturally. But don't waste anger on me on that account. Tell me what you want me to do.\"\n\n\n\"I want you to come to M. de Kercadiou with me, and to use your influence to obtain justice. I suppose I am asking too much.\"\n\n\n\"My dear Philippe, I exist to serve you. I warn you that it is a futile quest; but give me leave to finish my breakfast, and I am at your orders.\"\n\n\nM. de Vilmorin dropped into a winged armchair by the well-swept hearth, on which a piled-up fire of pine logs was burning cheerily. And whilst he waited now he gave his friend the latest news of the events in Rennes. Young, ardent, enthusiastic, and inspired by Utopian ideals, he passionately denounced the rebellious attitude of the privileged.\n\n\nAndre-Louis, already fully aware of the trend of feeling in the ranks of an order in whose deliberations he took part as the representative of a nobleman, was not at all surprised by what he heard. M. de Vilmorin found it exasperating that his friend should apparently decline to share his own indignation.\n\n\n\"Don't you see what it means?\" he cried. \"The nobles, by disobeying the King, are striking at the very foundations of the throne. Don't they perceive that their very existence depends upon it; that if the throne falls over, it is they who stand nearest to it who will be crushed? Don't they see that?\"\n\n\n\"Evidently not. They are just governing classes, and I never heard of governing classes that had eyes for anything but their own profit.\"\n\n\n\"That is our grievance. That is what we are going to change.\"\n\n\n\"You are going to abolish governing classes? An interesting experiment. I believe it was the original plan of creation, and it might have succeeded but for Cain.\"\n\n\n\"What we are going to do,\" said M. de Vilmorin, curbing his exasperation, \"is to transfer the government to other hands.\"\n\n\n\"And you think that will make a difference?\"\n\n\n\"I know it will.\"\n\n\n\"Ah! I take it that being now in minor orders, you already possess the confidence of the Almighty. He will have confided to you His intention of changing the pattern of mankind.\"\n\n\nM. de Vilmorin's fine ascetic face grew overcast. \"You are profane, Andre,\" he reproved his friend.\n\n\n\"I assure you that I am quite serious. To do what you imply would require nothing short of divine intervention. You must change man, not systems. Can you and our vapouring friends of the Literary Chamber of Rennes, or any other learned society of France, devise a system of government that has never yet been tried? Surely not. And can they say of any system tried that it proved other than a failure in the end? My dear Philippe, the future is to be read with certainty only in the past. Ab actu ad posse valet consecutio. Man never changes. He is always greedy, always acquisitive, always vile. I am speaking of Man in the bulk.\"\n\n\n\"Do you pretend that it is impossible to ameliorate the lot of the people?\" M. de Vilmorin challenged him.\n\n\n\"When you say the people you mean, of course, the populace. Will you abolish it? That is the only way to ameliorate its lot, for as long as it remains populace its lot will be damnation.\"\n\n\n\"You argue, of course, for the side that employs you. That is natural, I suppose.\" M. de Vilmorin spoke between sorrow and indignation.\n\n\n\"On the contrary, I seek to argue with absolute detachment. Let us test these ideas of yours. To what form of government do you aspire? A republic, it is to be inferred from what you have said. Well, you have it already. France in reality is a republic to-day.\"\n\n\nPhilippe stared at him. \"You are being paradoxical, I think. What of the King?\"\n\n\n\"The King? All the world knows there has been no king in France since Louis XIV. There is an obese gentleman at Versailles who wears the crown, but the very news you bring shows for how little he really counts. It is the nobles and clergy who sit in the high places, with the people of France harnessed under their feet, who are the real rulers. That is why I say that France is a republic; she is a republic built on the best pattern--the Roman pattern. Then, as now, there were great patrician families in luxury, preserving for themselves power and wealth, and what else is accounted worth possessing; and there was the populace crushed and groaning, sweating, bleeding, starving, and perishing in the Roman kennels. That was a republic; the mightiest we have seen.\"\n\n\nPhilippe strove with his impatience. \"At least you will admit--you have, in fact, admitted it--that we could not be worse governed than we are?\"\n\n\n\"That is not the point. The point is should we be better governed if we replaced the present ruling class by another? Without some guarantee of that I should be the last to lift a finger to effect a change. And what guarantees can you give? What is the class that aims at government? I will tell you. The bourgeoisie.\"\n\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\n\"That startles you, eh? Truth is so often disconcerting. You hadn't thought of it? Well, think of it now. Look well into this Nantes manifesto. Who are the authors of it?\"\n\n\n\"I can tell you who it was constrained the municipality of Nantes to send it to the King. Some ten thousand workmen--shipwrights, weavers, labourers, and artisans of every kind.\"\n\n\n\"Stimulated to it, driven to it, by their employers, the wealthy traders and shipowners of that city,\" Andre-Louis replied. \"I have a habit of observing things at close quarters, which is why our colleagues of the Literary Chamber dislike me so cordially in debate. Where I delve they but skim. Behind those labourers and artisans of Nantes, counselling them, urging on these poor, stupid, ignorant toilers to shed their blood in pursuit of the will o' the wisp of freedom, are the sail-makers, the spinners, the ship-owners and the slave-traders. The slave-traders! The men who live and grow rich by a traffic in human flesh and blood in the colonies, are conducting at home a campaign in the sacred name of liberty! Don't you see that the whole movement is a movement of hucksters and traders and peddling vassals swollen by wealth into envy of the power that lies in birth alone? The money-changers in Paris who hold the bonds in the national debt, seeing the parlous financial condition of the State, tremble at the thought that it may lie in the power of a single man to cancel the debt by bankruptcy. To secure themselves they are burrowing underground to overthrow a state and build upon its ruins a new one in which they shall be the masters. And to accomplish this they inflame the people. Already in Dauphiny we have seen blood run like water--the blood of the populace, always the blood of the populace. Now in Brittany we may see the like. And if in the end the new ideas prevail? if the seigneurial rule is overthrown, what then? You will have exchanged an aristocracy for a plutocracy. Is that worth while? Do you 'think that under money-changers and slave-traders and men who have waxed rich in other ways by the ignoble arts of buying and selling, the lot of the people will be any better than under their priests and nobles? Has it ever occurred to you, Philippe, what it is that makes the rule of the nobles so intolerable? Acquisitiveness. Acquisitiveness is the curse of mankind. And shall you expect less acquisitiveness in men who have built themselves up by acquisitiveness? Oh, I am ready to admit that the present government is execrable, unjust, tyrannical--what you will; but I beg you to look ahead, and to see that the government for which it is aimed at exchanging it may be infinitely worse.\"\n\n\nPhilippe sat thoughtful a moment. Then he returned to the attack.\n\n\n\"You do not speak of the abuses, the horrible, intolerable abuses of power under which we labour at present.\"\n\n\n\"Where there is power there will always be the abuse of it.\"\n\n\n\"Not if the tenure of power is dependent upon its equitable administration.\"\n\n\n\"The tenure of power is power. We cannot dictate to those who hold it.\"\n\n\n\"The people can--the people in its might.\"\n\n\n\"Again I ask you, when you say the people do you mean the populace? You do. What power can the populace wield? It can run wild. It can burn and slay for a time. But enduring power it cannot wield, because power demands qualities which the populace does not possess, or it would not be populace. The inevitable, tragic corollary of civilization is populace. For the rest, abuses can be corrected by equity; and equity, if it is not found in the enlightened, is not to be found at all. M. Necker is to set about correcting abuses, and limiting privileges. That is decided. To that end the States General are to assemble.\"\n\n\n\"And a promising beginning we have made in Brittany, as Heaven hears me!\" cried Philippe.\n\n\n\"Pooh! That is nothing. Naturally the nobles will not yield without a struggle. It is a futile and ridiculous struggle--but then... it is human nature, I suppose, to be futile and ridiculous.\"\n\n\nM. de Vilmorin became witheringly sarcastic. \"Probably you will also qualify the shooting of Mabey as futile and ridiculous. I should even be prepared to hear you argue in defence of the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr that his gamekeeper was merciful in shooting Mabey, since the alternative would have been a life-sentence to the galleys.\"\n\n\nAndre-Louis drank the remainder of his chocolate; set down his cup, and pushed back his chair, his breakfast done.\n\n\n\"I confess that I have not your big charity, my dear Philippe. I am touched by Mabey's fate. But, having conquered the shock of this news to my emotions, I do not forget that, after all, Mabey was thieving when he met his death.\"\n\n\nM. de Vilmorin heaved himself up in his indignation.\n\n\n\"That is the point of view to be expected in one who is the assistant fiscal intendant of a nobleman, and the delegate of a nobleman to the States of Brittany.\"\n\n\n\"Philippe, is that just? You are angry with me!\" he cried, in real solicitude.\n\n\n\"I am hurt,\" Vilmorin admitted. \"I am deeply hurt by your attitude. And I am not alone in resenting your reactionary tendencies. Do you know that the Literary Chamber is seriously considering your expulsion?\"\n\n\nAndre-Louis shrugged. \"That neither surprises nor troubles me.\"\n\n\nM. de Vilmorin swept on, passionately: \"Sometimes I think that you have no heart. With you it is always the law, never equity. It occurs to me, Andre, that I was mistaken in coming to you. You are not likely to be of assistance to me in my interview with M. de Kercadiou.\" He took up his hat, clearly with the intention of departing.\n\n\nAndre-Louis sprang up and caught him by the arm.\n\n\n\"I vow,\" said he, \"that this is the last time ever I shall consent to talk law or politics with you, Philippe. I love you too well to quarrel with you over other men's affairs.\"\n\n\n\"But I make them my own,\" Philippe insisted vehemently.\n\n\n\"Of course you do, and I love you for it. It is right that you should. You are to be a priest; and everybody's business is a priest's business. Whereas I am a lawyer--the fiscal intendant of a nobleman, as you say--and a lawyer's business is the business of his client. That is the difference between us. Nevertheless, you are not going to shake me off.\"\n\n\n\"But I tell you frankly, now that I come to think of it, that I should prefer you did not see M. de Kercadiou with me. Your duty to your client cannot be a help to me.\"\n\n\nHis wrath had passed; but his determination remained firm, based upon the reason he gave.\n\n\n\"Very well,\" said Andre-Louis. \"It shall be as you please. But nothing shall prevent me at least from walking with you as far as the chateau, and waiting for you while you make your appeal to M. de Kercadiou.\"\n\n\nAnd so they left the house good friends, for the sweetness of M. de Vilmorin's nature did not admit of rancour, and together they took their way up the steep main street of Gavrillac.",
    "At the statue's base he came upon a little cluster of students about the body of the murdered lad, all stricken with fear and helplessness.\n\n\n\"You here, Moreau!\" said a voice.\n\n\nHe looked round to find himself confronted by a slight, swarthy man of little more than thirty, firm of mouth and impertinent of nose, who considered him with disapproval. It was Le Chapelier, a lawyer of Rennes, a prominent member of the Literary Chamber of that city, a forceful man, fertile in revolutionary ideas and of an exceptional gift of eloquence.\n\n\n\"Ah, it is you, Chapelier! Why don't you speak to them? Why don't you tell them what to do? Up with you, man!\" And he pointed to the plinth.\n\n\nLe Chapelier's dark, restless eyes searched the other's impassive face for some trace of the irony he suspected. They were as wide asunder as the poles, these two, in their political views; and mistrusted as Andre-Louis was by all his colleagues of the Literary Chamber of Rennes, he was by none mistrusted so thoroughly as by this vigorous republican. Indeed, had Le Chapelier been able to prevail against the influence of the seminarist Vilmorin, Andre-Louis would long since have found himself excluded from that assembly of the intellectual youth of Rennes, which he exasperated by his eternal mockery of their ideals.\n\n\nSo now Le Chapelier suspected mockery in that invitation, suspected it even when he failed to find traces of it on Andre-Louis' face, for he had learnt by experience that it was a face not often to be trusted for an indication of the real thoughts that moved behind it.\n\n\n\"Your notions and mine on that score can hardly coincide,\" said he.\n\n\n\"Can there be two opinions?\" quoth Andre-Louis.\n\n\n\"There are usually two opinions whenever you and I are together, Moreau--more than ever now that you are the appointed delegate of a nobleman. You see what your friends have done. No doubt you approve their methods.\" He was coldly hostile.\n\n\nAndre-Louis looked at him without surprise. So invariably opposed to each other in academic debates, how should Le Chapelier suspect his present intentions?\n\n\n\"If you won't tell them what is to be done, I will,\" said he.\n\n\n\"Nom de Dieu! If you want to invite a bullet from the other side, I shall not hinder you. It may help to square the account.\"\n\n\nScarcely were the words out than he repented them; for as if in answer to that challenge Andre-Louis sprang up on to the plinth. Alarmed now, for he could only suppose it to be Andre-Louis' intention to speak on behalf of Privilege, of which he was a publicly appointed representative, Le Chapelier clutched him by the leg to pull him down again.\n\n\n\"Ah, that, no!\" he was shouting. \"Come down, you fool. Do you think we will let you ruin everything by your clowning? Come down!\"\n\n\nAndre-Louis, maintaining his position by clutching one of the legs of the bronze horse, flung his voice like a bugle-note over the heads of that seething mob.\n\n\n\"Citizens of Rennes, the motherland is in danger!\"\n\n\nThe effect was electric. A stir ran, like a ripple over water, across that froth of upturned human faces, and completest silence followed. In that great silence they looked at this slim young man, hatless, long wisps of his black hair fluttering in the breeze, his neckcloth in disorder, his face white, his eyes on fire.\n\n\nAndre-Louis felt a sudden surge of exaltation as he realized by instinct that at one grip he had seized that crowd, and that he held it fast in the spell of his cry and his audacity.\n\n\nEven Le Chapelier, though still clinging to his ankle, had ceased to tug. The reformer, though unshaken in his assumption of Andre-Louis' intentions, was for a moment bewildered by the first note of his appeal.\n\n\nAnd then, slowly, impressively, in a voice that travelled clear to the ends of the square, the young lawyer of Gavrillac began to speak.\n\n\n\"Shuddering in horror of the vile deed here perpetrated, my voice demands to be heard by you. You have seen murder done under your eyes--the murder of one who nobly, without any thought of self, gave voice to the wrongs by which we are all oppressed. Fearing that voice, shunning the truth as foul things shun the light, our oppressors sent their agents to silence him in death.\"\n\n\nLe Chapelier released at last his hold of Andre-Louis' ankle, staring up at him the while in sheer amazement. It seemed that the fellow was in earnest; serious for once; and for once on the right side. What had come to him?\n\n\n\"Of assassins what shall you look for but assassination? I have a tale to tell which will show that this is no new thing that you have witnessed here to-day; it will reveal to you the forces with which you have to deal. Yesterday...\"\n\n\nThere was an interruption. A voice in the crowd, some twenty paces, perhaps, was raised to shout:\n\n\n\"Yet another of them!\"\n\n\nImmediately after the voice came a pistol-shot, and a bullet flattened itself against the bronze figure just behind Andre-Louis.\n\n\nInstantly there was turmoil in the crowd, most intense about the spot whence the shot had been fired. The assailant was one of a considerable group of the opposition, a group that found itself at once beset on every side, and hard put to it to defend him.\n\n\nFrom the foot of the plinth rang the voice of the students making chorus to Le Chapelier, who was bidding Andre-Louis to seek shelter.\n\n\n\"Come down! Come down at once! They'll murder you as they murdered La Riviere.\"\n\n\n\"Let them!\" He flung wide his arms in a gesture supremely theatrical, and laughed. \"I stand here at their mercy. Let them, if they will, add mine to the blood that will presently rise up to choke them. Let them assassinate me. It is a trade they understand. But until they do so, they shall not prevent me from speaking to you, from telling you what is to be looked for in them.\" And again he laughed, not merely in exaltation as they supposed who watched him from below, but also in amusement. And his amusement had two sources. One was to discover how glibly he uttered the phrases proper to whip up the emotions of a crowd: the other was in the remembrance of how the crafty Cardinal de Retz, for the purpose of inflaming popular sympathy on his behalf, had been in the habit of hiring fellows to fire upon his carriage. He was in just such case as that arch-politician. True, he had not hired the fellow to fire that pistol-shot; but he was none the less obliged to him, and ready to derive the fullest, advantage from the act.\n\n\nThe group that sought to protect that man was battling on, seeking to hew a way out of that angry, heaving press.\n\n\n\"Let them go!\" Andre-Louis called down...\"What matters one assassin more or less? Let them go, and listen to me, my countrymen!\"\n\n\nAnd presently, when some measure of order was restored, he began his tale. In simple language now, yet with a vehemence and directness that drove home every point, he tore their hearts with the story of yesterday's happenings at Gavrillac. He drew tears from them with the pathos of his picture of the bereaved widow Mabey and her three starving, destitute children--\"orphaned to avenge the death of a pheasant\"--and the bereaved mother of that M. de Vilmorin, a student of Rennes, known here to many of them, who had met his death in a noble endeavour to champion the cause of an esurient member of their afflicted order.\n\n\n\"The Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr said of him that he had too dangerous a gift of eloquence. It was to silence his brave voice that he killed him. But he has failed of his object. For I, poor Philippe de Vilmorin's friend, have assumed the mantle of his apostleship, and I speak to you with his voice to-day.\"\n\n\nIt was a statement that helped Le Chapelier at last to understand, at least in part, this bewildering change in Andre-Louis, which rendered him faithless to the side that employed him.\n\n\n\"I am not here,\" continued Andre-Louis, \"merely to demand at your hands vengeance upon Philippe de Vilmorin's murderers. I am here to tell you the things he would to-day have told you had he lived.\"\n\n\nSo far at least he was frank. But he did not add that they were things he did not himself believe, things that he accounted the cant by which an ambitious bourgeoisie--speaking through the mouths of the lawyers, who were its articulate part--sought to overthrow to its own advantage the present state of things. He left his audience in the natural belief that the views he expressed were the views he held.\n\n\nAnd now in a terrible voice, with an eloquence that amazed himself, he denounced the inertia of the royal justice where the great are the offenders. It was with bitter sarcasm that he spoke of their King's Lieutenant, M. de Lesdiguieres.\n\n\n\"Do you wonder,\" he asked them, \"that M. de Lesdiguieres should administer the law so that it shall ever be favourable to our great nobles? Would it be just, would it be reasonable that he should otherwise administer it?\" He paused dramatically to let his sarcasm sink in. It had the effect of reawakening Le Chapelier's doubts, and checking his dawning conviction in Andre-Louis' sincerity. Whither was he going now?\n\n\nHe was not left long in doubt. Proceeding, Andre-Louis spoke as he conceived that Philippe de Vilmorin would have spoken. He had so often argued with him, so often attended the discussions of the Literary Chamber, that he had all the rant of the reformers--that was yet true in substance--at his fingers' ends.\n\n\n\"Consider, after all, the composition of this France of ours. A million of its inhabitants are members of the privileged classes. They compose France. They are France. For surely you cannot suppose the remainder to be anything that matters. It cannot be pretended that twenty-four million souls are of any account, that they can be representative of this great nation, or that they can exist for any purpose but that of servitude to the million elect.\"\n\n\nBitter laughter shook them now, as he desired it should. \"Seeing their privileges in danger of invasion by these twenty-four millions--mostly canailles; possibly created by God, it is true, but clearly so created to be the slaves of Privilege--does it surprise you that the dispensing of royal justice should be placed in the stout hands of these Lesdiguieres, men without brains to think or hearts to be touched? Consider what it is that must be defended against the assault of us others--canaille. Consider a few of these feudal rights that are in danger of being swept away should the Privileged yield even to the commands of their sovereign; and admit the Third Estate to an equal vote with themselves.\n\n\n\"What would become of the right of terrage on the land, of parciere on the fruit-trees, of carpot on the vines? What of the corvees by which they command forced labour, of the ban de vendage, which gives them the first vintage, the banvin which enables them to control to their own advantage the sale of wine? What of their right of grinding the last liard of taxation out of the people to maintain their own opulent estate; the cens, the lods-et-ventes, which absorb a fifth of the value of the land, the blairee, which must be paid before herds can feed on communal lands, the pulverage to indemnify them for the dust raised on their roads by the herds that go to market, the sextelage on everything offered for sale in the public markets, the etalonnage, and all the rest? What of their rights over men and animals for field labour, of ferries over rivers, and of bridges over streams, of sinking wells, of warren, of dovecot, and of fire, which last yields them a tax on every peasant hearth? What of their exclusive rights of fishing and of hunting, the violation of which is ranked as almost a capital offence?\n\n\n\"And what of other rights, unspeakable, abominable, over the lives and bodies of their people, rights which, if rarely exercised, have never been rescinded. To this day if a noble returning from the hunt were to slay two of his serfs to bathe and refresh his feet in their blood, he could still claim in his sufficient defence that it was his absolute feudal right to do so.\n\n\n\"Rough-shod, these million Privileged ride over the souls and bodies of twenty-four million contemptible canaille existing but for their own pleasure. Woe betide him who so much as raises his voice in protest in the name of humanity against an excess of these already excessive abuses. I have told you of one remorselessly slain in cold blood for doing no more than that. Your own eyes have witnessed the assassination of another here upon this plinth, of yet another over there by the cathedral works, and the attempt upon my own life.\n\n\n\"Between them and the justice due to them in such cases stand these Lesdiguieres, these King's Lieutenants; not instruments of justice, but walls erected for the shelter of Privilege and Abuse whenever it exceeds its grotesquely excessive rights.\n\n\n\"Do you wonder that they will not yield an inch; that they will resist the election of a Third Estate with the voting power to sweep all these privileges away, to compel the Privileged to submit themselves to a just equality in the eyes of the law with the meanest of the canaille they trample underfoot, to provide that the moneys necessary to save this state from the bankruptcy into which they have all but plunged it shall be raised by taxation to be borne by themselves in the same proportion as by others?\n\n\n\"Sooner than yield to so much they prefer to resist even the royal command.\"\n\n\nA phrase occurred to him used yesterday by Vilmorin, a phrase to which he had refused to attach importance when uttered then. He used it now. \"In doing this they are striking at the very foundations of the throne. These fools do not perceive that if that throne falls over, it is they who stand nearest to it who will be crushed.\"\n\n\nA terrific roar acclaimed that statement. Tense and quivering with the excitement that was flowing through him, and from him out into that great audience, he stood a moment smiling ironically. Then he waved them into silence, and saw by their ready obedience how completely he possessed them. For in the voice with which he spoke each now recognized the voice of himself, giving at last expression to the thoughts that for months and years had been inarticulately stirring in each simple mind.",
    "Coming presently upon the Redon road, Andre-Louis, obeying instinct rather than reason, turned his face to the south, and plodded wearily and mechanically forward. He had no clear idea of whither he was going, or of whither he should go. All that imported at the moment was to put as great a distance as possible between Gavrillac and himself.\n\n\nHe had a vague, half-formed notion of returning to Nantes; and there, by employing the newly found weapon of his oratory, excite the people into sheltering him as the first victim of the persecution he had foreseen, and against which he had sworn them to take up arms. But the idea was one which he entertained merely as an indefinite possibility upon which he felt no real impulse to act.\n\n\nMeanwhile he chuckled at the thought of Fresnel as he had last seen him, with his muffled face and glaring eyeballs. \"For one who was anything but a man of action,\" he writes, \"I felt that I had acquitted myself none so badly.\" It is a phrase that recurs at intervals in his sketchy \"Confessions.\" Constantly is he reminding you that he is a man of mental and not physical activities, and apologizing when dire necessity drives him into acts of violence. I suspect this insistence upon his philosophic detachment--for which I confess he had justification enough--to betray his besetting vanity.\n\n\nWith increasing fatigue came depression and self-criticism. He had stupidly overshot his mark in insultingly denouncing M. de Lesdiguieres. \"It is much better,\" he says somewhere, \"to be wicked than to be stupid. Most of this world's misery is the fruit not as priests tell us of wickedness, but of stupidity.\" And we know that of all stupidities he considered anger the most deplorable. Yet he had permitted himself to be angry with a creature like M. de Lesdiguieres--a lackey, a fribble, a nothing, despite his potentialities for evil. He could perfectly have discharged his self-imposed mission without arousing the vindictive resentment of the King's Lieutenant.\n\n\nHe beheld himself vaguely launched upon life with the riding-suit in which he stood, a single louis d'or and a few pieces of silver for all capital, and a knowledge of law which had been inadequate to preserve him from the consequences of infringing it.\n\n\nHe had, in addition--but these things that were to be the real salvation of him he did not reckon--his gift of laughter, sadly repressed of late, and the philosophic outlook and mercurial temperament which are the stock-in-trade of your adventurer in all ages.\n\n\nMeanwhile he tramped mechanically on through the night, until he felt that he could tramp no more. He had skirted the little township of Guichen, and now within a half-mile of Guignen, and with Gavrillac a good seven miles behind him, his legs refused to carry him any farther.\n\n\nHe was midway across the vast common to the north of Guignen when he came to a halt. He had left the road, and taken heedlessly to the footpath that struck across the waste of indifferent pasture interspersed with clumps of gorse. A stone's throw away on his right the common was bordered by a thorn hedge. Beyond this loomed a tall building which he knew to be an open barn, standing on the edge of a long stretch of meadowland. That dark, silent shadow it may have been that had brought him to a standstill, suggesting shelter to his subconsciousness. A moment he hesitated; then he struck across towards a spot where a gap in the hedge was closed by a five-barred gate. He pushed the gate open, went through the gap, and stood now before the barn. It was as big as a house, yet consisted of no more than a roof carried upon half a dozen tall, brick pillars. But densely packed under that roof was a great stack of hay that promised a warm couch on so cold a night. Stout timbers had been built into the brick pillars, with projecting ends to serve as ladders by which the labourer might climb to pack or withdraw hay. With what little strength remained him, Andre-Louis climbed by one of these and landed safely at the top, where he was forced to kneel, for lack of room to stand upright. Arrived there, he removed his coat and neckcloth, his sodden boots and stockings. Next he cleared a trough for his body, and lying down in it, covered himself to the neck with the hay he had removed. Within five minutes he was lost to all worldly cares and soundly asleep.\n\n\nWhen next he awakened, the sun was already high in the heavens, from which he concluded that the morning was well advanced; and this before he realized quite where he was or how he came there. Then to his awakening senses came a drone of voices close at hand, to which at first he paid little heed. He was deliciously refreshed, luxuriously drowsy and luxuriously warm.\n\n\nBut as consciousness and memory grew more full, he raised his head clear of the hay that he might free both ears to listen, his pulses faintly quickened by the nascent fear that those voices might bode him no good. Then he caught the reassuring accents of a woman, musical and silvery, though laden with alarm.\n\n\n\"Ah, mon Dieu, Leandre, let us separate at once. If it should be my father...\"\n\n\nAnd upon this a man's voice broke in, calm and reassuring:\n\n\n\"No, no, Climene; you are mistaken. There is no one coming. We are quite safe. Why do you start at shadows?\"\n\n\n\"Ah, Leandre, if he should find us here together! I tremble at the very thought.\"\n\n\nMore was not needed to reassure Andre-Louis. He had overheard enough to know that this was but the case of a pair of lovers who, with less to fear of life, were yet--after the manner of their kind--more timid of heart than he. Curiosity drew him from his warm trough to the edge of the hay. Lying prone, he advanced his head and peered down.\n\n\nIn the space of cropped meadow between the barn and the hedge stood a man and a woman, both young. The man was a well-set-up, comely fellow, with a fine head of chestnut hair tied in a queue by a broad bow of black satin. He was dressed with certain tawdry attempts at ostentatious embellishments, which did not prepossess one at first glance in his favour. His coat of a fashionable cut was of faded plum-coloured velvet edged with silver lace, whose glory had long since departed. He affected ruffles, but for want of starch they hung like weeping willows over hands that were fine and delicate. His breeches were of plain black cloth, and his black stockings were of cotton--matters entirely out of harmony with his magnificent coat. His shoes, stout and serviceable, were decked with buckles of cheap, lack-lustre paste. But for his engaging and ingenuous countenance, Andre-Louis must have set him down as a knight of that order which lives dishonestly by its wits. As it was, he suspended judgment whilst pushing investigation further by a study of the girl. At the outset, be it confessed that it was a study that attracted him prodigiously. And this notwithstanding the fact that, bookish and studious as were his ways, and in despite of his years, it was far from his habit to waste consideration on femininity.\n\n\nThe child--she was no more than that, perhaps twenty at the most--possessed, in addition to the allurements of face and shape that went very near perfection, a sparkling vivacity and a grace of movement the like of which Andre-Louis did not remember ever before to have beheld assembled in one person. And her voice too--that musical, silvery voice that had awakened him--possessed in its exquisite modulations an allurement of its own that must have been irresistible, he thought, in the ugliest of her sex. She wore a hooded mantle of green cloth, and the hood being thrown back, her dainty head was all revealed to him. There were glints of gold struck by the morning sun from her light nut-brown hair that hung in a cluster of curls about her oval face. Her complexion was of a delicacy that he could compare only with a rose petal. He could not at that distance discern the colour of her eyes, but he guessed them blue, as he admired the sparkle of them under the fine, dark line of eyebrows.\n\n\nHe could not have told you why, but he was conscious that it aggrieved him to find her so intimate with this pretty young fellow, who was partly clad, as it appeared, in the cast-offs of a nobleman. He could not guess her station, but the speech that reached him was cultured in tone and word. He strained to listen.\n\n\n\"I shall know no peace, Leandre, until we are safely wedded,\" she was saying. \"Not until then shall I count myself beyond his reach. And yet if we marry without his consent, we but make trouble for ourselves, and of gaining his consent I almost despair.\"\n\n\nEvidently, thought Andre-Louis, her father was a man of sense, who saw through the shabby finery of M. Leandre, and was not to be dazzled by cheap paste buckles.\n\n\n\"My dear Climene,\" the young man was answering her, standing squarely before her, and holding both her hands, \"you are wrong to despond. If I do not reveal to you all the stratagem that I have prepared to win the consent of your unnatural parent, it is because I am loath to rob you of the pleasure of the surprise that is in store. But place your faith in me, and in that ingenious friend of whom I have spoken, and who should be here at any moment.\"\n\n\nThe stilted ass! Had he learnt that speech by heart in advance, or was he by nature a pedantic idiot who expressed himself in this set and formal manner? How came so sweet a blossom to waste her perfumes on such a prig? And what a ridiculous name the creature owned!\n\n\nThus Andre-Louis to himself from his observatory. Meanwhile, she was speaking.\n\n\n\"That is what my heart desires, Leandre, but I am beset by fears lest your stratagem should be too late. I am to marry this horrible Marquis of Sbrufadelli this very day. He arrives by noon. He comes to sign the contract--to make me the Marchioness of Sbrufadelli. Oh!\" It was a cry of pain from that tender young heart. \"The very name burns my lips. If it were mine I could never utter it--never! The man is so detestable. Save me, Leandre. Save me! You are my only hope.\"\n\n\nAndre-Louis was conscious of a pang of disappointment. She failed to soar to the heights he had expected of her. She was evidently infected by the stilted manner of her ridiculous lover. There was an atrocious lack of sincerity about her words. They touched his mind, but left his heart unmoved. Perhaps this was because of his antipathy to M. Leandre and to the issue involved.\n\n\nSo her father was marrying her to a marquis! That implied birth on her side. And yet she was content to pair off with this dull young adventurer in the tarnished lace! It was, he supposed, the sort of thing to be expected of a sex that all philosophy had taught him to regard as the maddest part of a mad species.\n\n\n\"It shall never be!\" M. Leandre was storming passionately. \"Never! I swear it!\" And he shook his puny fist at the blue vault of heaven--Ajax defying Jupiter. \"Ah, but here comes our subtle friend...\" (Andre-Louis did not catch the name, M. Leandre having at that moment turned to face the gap in the hedge.) \"He will bring us news, I know.\"\n\n\nAndre-Louis looked also in the direction of the gap. Through it emerged a lean, slight man in a rusty cloak and a three-cornered hat worn well down over his nose so as to shade his face. And when presently he doffed this hat and made a sweeping bow to the young lovers, Andre-Louis confessed to himself that had he been cursed with such a hangdog countenance he would have worn his hat in precisely such a manner, so as to conceal as much of it as possible. If M. Leandre appeared to be wearing, in part at least, the cast-offs of nobleman, the newcomer appeared to be wearing the cast-offs of M. Leandre. Yet despite his vile clothes and viler face, with its three days' growth of beard, the fellow carried himself with a certain air; he positively strutted as he advanced, and he made a leg in a manner that was courtly and practised.\n\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, with the air of a conspirator, \"the time for action has arrived, and so has the Marquis... That is why.\"\n\n\nThe young lovers sprang apart in consternation; Climene with clasped hands, parted lips, and a bosom that raced distractingly under its white fichu-menteur; M. Leandre agape, the very picture of foolishness and dismay.\n\n\nMeanwhile the newcomer rattled on. \"I was at the inn an hour ago when he descended there, and I studied him attentively whilst he was at breakfast. Having done so, not a single doubt remains me of our success. As for what he looks like, I could entertain you at length upon the fashion in which nature has designed his gross fatuity. But that is no matter. We are concerned with what he is, with the wit of him. And I tell you confidently that I find him so dull and stupid that you may be confident he will tumble headlong into each and all of the traps I have so cunningly prepared for him.\"\n\n\n\"Tell me, tell me! Speak!\" Climene implored him, holding out her hands in a supplication no man of sensibility could have resisted. And then on the instant she caught her breath on a faint scream. \"My father!\" she exclaimed, turning distractedly from one to the other of those two. \"He is coming! We are lost!\"\n\n\n\"You must fly, Climene!\" said M. Leandre.\n\n\n\"Too late!\" she sobbed. \"Too late! He is here.\"\n\n\n\"Calm, mademoiselle, calm!\" the subtle friend was urging her. \"Keep calm and trust to me. I promise you that all shall be well.\"\n\n\n\"Oh!\" cried M. Leandre, limply. \"Say what you will, my friend, this is ruin--the end of all our hopes. Your wits will never extricate us from this. Never!\"\n\n\nThrough the gap strode now an enormous man with an inflamed moon face and a great nose, decently dressed after the fashion of a solid bourgeois. There was no mistaking his anger, but the expression that it found was an amazement to Andre-Louis.\n\n\n\"Leandre, you're an imbecile! Too much phlegm, too much phlegm! Your words wouldn't convince a ploughboy! Have you considered what they mean at all? Thus,\" he cried, and casting his round hat from him in a broad gesture, he took his stand at M. Leandre's side, and repeated the very words that Leandre had lately uttered, what time the three observed him coolly and attentively.\n\n\n\"Oh, say what you will, my friend, this is ruin--the end of all our hopes. Your wits will never extricate us from this. Never!\"\n\n\nA frenzy of despair vibrated in his accents. He swung again to face M. Leandre. \"Thus,\" he bade him contemptuously. \"Let the passion of your hopelessness express itself in your voice. Consider that you are not asking Scaramouche here whether he has put a patch in your breeches. You are a despairing lover expressing...\"\n\n\nHe checked abruptly, startled. Andre-Louis, suddenly realizing what was afoot, and how duped he had been, had loosed his laughter. The sound of it pealing and booming uncannily under the great roof that so immediately confined him was startling to those below.\n\n\nThe fat man was the first to recover, and he announced it after his own fashion in one of the ready sarcasms in which he habitually dealt.\n\n\n\"Hark!\" he cried, \"the very gods laugh at you, Leandre.\" Then he addressed the roof of the barn and its invisible tenant. \"Hi! You there!\"",
    "They numbered exactly eleven, three women and eight men; and they addressed each other by their stage names: names which denoted their several types, and never--or only very slightly--varied, no matter what might be the play that they performed.\n\n\"We are,\" Pantaloon informed him, \"one of those few remaining staunch bands of real players, who uphold the traditions of the old Italian Commedia dell' Arte. Not for us to vex our memories and stultify our wit with the stilted phrases that are the fruit of a wretched author's lucubrations. Each of us is in detail his own author in a measure as he develops the part assigned to him. We are improvisers--improvisers of the old and noble Italian school.\"\n\n\"I had guessed as much,\" said Andre-Louis, \"when I discovered you rehearsing your improvisations.\"\n\nPantaloon frowned. \"I have observed, young sir, that your humour inclines to the pungent, not to say the acrid. It is very well. It is, I suppose, the humour that should go with such a countenance. But it may lead you astray, as in this instance. That rehearsal--a most unusual thing with us--was necessitated by the histrionic rawness of our Leandre. We are seeking to inculcate into him by training an art with which Nature neglected to endow him against his present needs. Should he continue to fail in doing justice to our schooling... But we will not disturb our present harmony with the unpleasant anticipation of misfortunes which we still hope to avert. We love our Leandre, for all his faults. Let me make you acquainted with our company.\"\n\nAnd he proceeded to introduction in detail. He pointed out the long and amiable Rhodomont, whom Andre-Louis already knew. \"His length of limb and hooked nose were his superficial qualifications to play roaring captains,\" Pantaloon explained. \"His lungs have justified our choice. You should hear him roar. At first we called him Spavento or Epouvapte. But that was unworthy of so great an artist. Not since the superb Mondor amazed the world has so thrasonical a bully been seen upon the stage. So we conferred upon him the name of Rhodomont that Mondor made famous; and I give you my word, as an actor and a gentleman--for I am a gentleman, monsieur, or was--that he has justified us.\"\n\nHis little eyes beamed in his great swollen face as he turned their gaze upon the object of his encomium. The terrible Rhodomont, confused by so much praise, blushed like a schoolgirl as he met the solemn scrutiny of Andre-Louis.\n\n\"Then here we have Scaramouche, whom also you already know. Sometimes he is Scapin and sometimes Coviello, but in the main Scaramouche, to which let me tell you he is best suited--sometimes too well suited, I think. For he is Scaramouche not only on the stage, but also in the world. He has a gift of sly intrigue, an art of setting folk by the ears, combined with an impudent aggressiveness upon occasion when he considers himself safe from reprisals. He is Scaramouche, the little skirmisher, to the very life. I could say more. But I am by disposition charitable and loving to all mankind.\"\n\n\"As the priest said when he kissed the serving-wench,\" snarled Scaramouche, and went on eating.\n\n\"His humour, like your own, you will observe, is acrid,\" said Pantaloon. He passed on. \"Then that rascal with the lumpy nose and the grinning bucolic countenance is, of course, Pierrot. Could he be aught else?\"\n\n\"I could play lovers a deal better,\" said the rustic cherub.\n\n\"That is the delusion proper to Pierrot,\" said Pantaloon, contemptuously. \"This heavy, beetle-browed ruffian, who has grown old in sin, and whose appetite increases with his years, is Polichinelle. Each one, as you perceive, is designed by Nature for the part he plays. This nimble, freckled jackanapes is Harlequin; not your spangled Harlequin into which modern degeneracy has debased that first-born of Momus, but the genuine original zany of the Commedia, ragged and patched, an impudent, cowardly, blackguardly clown.\"\n\n\"Each one of us, as you perceive,\" said Harlequin, mimicking the leader of the troupe, \"is designed by Nature for the part he plays.\"\n\n\"Physically, my friend, physically only, else we should not have so much trouble in teaching this beautiful Leandre to become a lover. Then we have Pasquariel here, who is sometimes an apothecary, sometimes a notary, sometimes a lackey--an amiable, accommodating fellow. He is also an excellent cook, being a child of Italy, that land of gluttons. And finally, you have myself, who as the father of the company very properly play as Pantaloon the roles of father. Sometimes, it is true, I am a deluded husband, and sometimes an ignorant, self-sufficient doctor. But it is rarely that I find it necessary to call myself other than Pantaloon. For the rest, I am the only one who has a name--a real name. It is Binet, monsieur.\n\n\n\"And now for the ladies... First in order of seniority we have Madame there.\" He waved one of his great hands towards a buxom, smiling blonde of five-and-forty, who was seated on the lowest of the steps of the travelling house. \"She is our Duegne, or Mother, or Nurse, as the case requires. She is known quite simply and royally as Madame. If she ever had a name in the world, she has long since forgotten it, which is perhaps as well. Then we have this pert jade with the tip-tilted nose and the wide mouth, who is of course our soubrette Columbine, and lastly, my daughter Climene, an amoureuse of talents not to be matched outside the Comedie Francaise, of which she has the bad taste to aspire to become a member.\"\n\nThe lovely Climene--and lovely indeed she was--tossed her nut-brown curls and laughed as she looked across at Andre-Louis. Her eyes, he had perceived by now, were not blue, but hazel.\n\n\"Do not believe him, monsieur. Here I am queen, and I prefer to be queen here rather than a slave in Paris.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Andre-Louis, quite solemnly, \"will be queen wherever she condescends to reign.\"\n\nHer only answer was a timid--timid and yet alluring--glance from under fluttering lids. Meanwhile her father was bawling at the comely young man who played lovers--\"You hear, Leandre! That is the sort of speech you should practise.\"\n\nLeandre raised languid eyebrows. \"That?\" quoth he, and shrugged. \"The merest commonplace.\"\n\nAndre-Louis laughed approval. \"M. Leandre is of a readier wit than you concede. There is subtlety in pronouncing it a commonplace to call Mlle. Climene a queen.\"\n\nSome laughed, M. Binet amongst them, with good-humoured mockery. \"You think he has the wit to mean it thus? Bah! His subtleties are all unconscious.\"\n\nThe conversation becoming general, Andre-Louis soon learnt what yet there was to learn of this strolling band. They were on their way to Guichen, where they hoped to prosper at the fair that was to open on Monday next. They would make their triumphal entry into the town at noon, and setting up their stage in the old market, they would give their first performance that same Saturday night, in a new canevas--or scenario--of M. Binet's own, which should set the rustics gaping. And then M. Binet fetched a sigh, and addressed himself to the elderly, swarthy, beetle-browed Polichinelle, who sat on his left.\n\n\"But we shall miss Felicien,\" said he. \"Indeed, I do not know what we shall do without him.\"\n\n\"Oh, we shall contrive,\" said Polichinelle, with his mouth full.\n\n\"So you always say, whatever happens, knowing that in any case the contriving will not fall upon yourself.\"\n\n\"He should not be difficult to replace,\" said Harlequin.\n\n\"True, if we were in a civilized land. But where among the rustics of Brittany are we to find a fellow of even his poor parts?\" M. Binet turned to Andre-Louis. \"He was our property-man, our machinist, our stage-carpenter, our man of affairs, and occasionally he acted.\"\n\n\"The part of Figaro, I presume,\" said Andre-Louis, which elicited a laugh.\n\n\"So you are acquainted with Beaumarchais!\" Binet eyed the young man with fresh interest.\n\n\"He is tolerably well known, I think.\"\n\n\"In Paris, to be sure. But I had not dreamt his fame had reached the wilds of Brittany.\"\n\n\"But then I was some years in Paris--at the Lycee of Louis le Grand. It was there I made acquaintance with his work.\"\n\n\"A dangerous man,\" said Polichinelle, sententiously.\n\n\"Indeed, and you are right,\" Pantaloon agreed. \"Clever--I do not deny him that, although myself I find little use for authors. But of a sinister cleverness responsible for the dissemination of many of these subversive new ideas. I think such writers should be suppressed.\"\n\n\"M. de La Tour d'Azyr would probably agree with you--the gentleman who by the simple exertion of his will turns this communal land into his own property.\" And Andre-Louis drained his cup, which had been filled with the poor vin gris that was the players' drink.\n\n\nIt was a remark that might have precipitated an argument had it not also reminded M. Binet of the terms on which they were encamped there, and of the fact that the half-hour was more than past. In a moment he was on his feet, leaping up with an agility surprising in so corpulent a man, issuing his commands like a marshal on a field of battle.\n\n\"Come, come, my lads! Are we to sit guzzling here all day? Time flees, and there's a deal to be done if we are to make our entry into Guichen at noon. Go, get you dressed. We strike camp in twenty minutes. Bestir, ladies! To your chaise, and see that you contrive to look your best. Soon the eyes of Guichen will be upon you, and the condition of your interior to-morrow will depend upon the impression made by your exterior to-day. Away! Away!\"",
    "Among the duties inherited by Andre-Louis from the departed Felicien whom he replaced, was that of doorkeeper. This duty he discharged dressed in a Polichinelle costume, and wearing a pasteboard nose. It was an arrangement mutually agreeable to M. Binet and himself. M. Binet--who had taken the further precaution of retaining Andre-Louis' own garments--was thereby protected against the risk of his latest recruit absconding with the takings. Andre-Louis, without illusions on the score of Pantaloon's real object, agreed to it willingly enough, since it protected him from the chance of recognition by any acquaintance who might possibly be in Guichen.\n\nThe performance was in every sense unexciting; the audience meagre and unenthusiastic. The benches provided in the front half of the market contained some twenty-seven persons: eleven at twenty sous a head and sixteen at twelve. Behind these stood a rabble of some thirty others at six sous apiece. Thus the gross takings were two louis, ten livres, and two sous. By the time M. Binet had paid for the use of the market, his lights, and the expenses of his company at the inn over Sunday, there was not likely to be very much left towards the wages of his players. It is not surprising, therefore, that M. Binet's bonhomie should have been a trifle overcast that evening.\n\n\"And what do you think of it?\" he asked Andre-Louis, as they were walking back to the inn after the performance.\n\n\"Possibly it could have been worse; probably it could not,\" said he.\n\nIn sheer amazement M. Binet checked in his stride, and turned to look at his companion.\n\n\"Huh!\" said he. \"Dieu de Dien! But you are frank.\"\n\n\"An unpopular form of service among fools, I know.\"\n\n\"Well, I am not a fool,\" said Binet.\n\n\"That is why I am frank. I pay you the compliment of assuming intelligence in you, M. Binet.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do?\" quoth M. Binet. \"And who the devil are you to assume anything? Your assumptions are presumptuous, sir.\" And with that he lapsed into silence and the gloomy business of mentally casting up his accounts.\n\nBut at table over supper a half-hour later he revived the topic.\n\n\"Our latest recruit, this excellent M. Parvissimus,\" he announced, \"has the impudence to tell me that possibly our comedy could have been worse, but that probably it could not.\" And he blew out his great round cheeks to invite a laugh at the expense of that foolish critic.\n\n\"That's bad,\" said the swarthy and sardonic Polichinelle. \"That's bad. But what is infinitely worse is that the audience had the impudence to be of the same mind.\"\n\n\"An ignorant pack of clods,\" sneered Leandre, with a toss of his handsome head.\n\n\"You are wrong,\" quoth Harlequin. \"You were born for love, my dear, not criticism.\"\n\nLeandre--a dull dog, as you will have conceived--looked contemptuously down upon the little man. \"And you, what were you born for?\" he wondered.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" was the candid admission. \"Nor yet why. It is the case of many of us, my dear, believe me.\"\n\n\"But why\"--M. Binet took him up, and thus spoilt the beginnings of a very pretty quarrel--\"why do you say that Leandre is wrong?\"\n\n\"To be general, because he is always wrong. To be particular, because I judge the audience of Guichen to be too sophisticated for 'The Heartless Father.'\"\n\n\"You would put it more happily,\" interposed Andre-Louis--who was the cause of this discussion--\"if you said that 'The Heartless Father' is too unsophisticated for the audience of Guichen.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the difference?\" asked Leandre.\n\n\"I didn't imply a difference. I merely suggested that it is a happier way to express the fact.\"\n\n\"The gentleman is being subtle,\" sneered Binet.\n\n\"Why happier?\" Harlequin demanded.\n\n\"Because it is easier to bring 'The Heartless Father' to the sophistication of the Guichen audience, than the Guichen audience to the unsophistication of 'The Heartless Father.'\"\n\n\"Let me think it out,\" groaned Polichinelle, and he took his head in his hands.\n\nBut from the tail of the table Andre-Louis was challenged by Climene who sat there between Columbine and Madame.\n\n\"You would alter the comedy, would you, M. Parvissimus?\" she cried.\n\nHe turned to parry her malice.\n\n\"I would suggest that it be altered,\" he corrected, inclining his head.\n\n\"And how would you alter it, monsieur?\"\n\n\"I? Oh, for the better.\"\n\n\"But of course!\" She was sleekest sarcasm. \"And how would you do it?\"\n\n\"Aye, tell us that,\" roared M. Binet, and added: \"Silence, I pray you, gentlemen and ladies. Silence for M. Parvissimus.\"\n\nAndre-Louis looked from father to daughter, and smiled. \"Pardi!\" said he. \"I am between bludgeon and dagger. If I escape with my life, I shall be fortunate. Why, then, since you pin me to the very wall, I'll tell you what I should do. I should go back to the original and help myself more freely from it.\"\n\n\"The original?\" questioned M. Binet--the author.\n\n\"It is called, I believe, 'Monsieur de Pourceaugnac,' and was written by Moliere.\"\n\nSomebody tittered, but that somebody was not M. Binet. He had been touched on the raw, and the look in his little eyes betrayed the fact that his bonhomme exterior covered anything but a bonhomme.\n\n\"You charge me with plagiarism,\" he said at last; \"with filching the ideas of Moliere.\"\n\n\"There is always, of course,\" said Andre-Louis, unruffled, \"the alternative possibility of two great minds working upon parallel lines.\"\n\nM. Binet studied the young man attentively a moment. He found him bland and inscrutable, and decided to pin him down.\n\n\"Then you do not imply that I have been stealing from Moliere?\"\n\n\"I advise you to do so, monsieur,\" was the disconcerting reply.\n\nM. Binet was shocked.\n\n\"You advise me to do so! You advise me, me, Antoine Binet, to turn thief at my age!\"\n\n\"He is outrageous,\" said mademoiselle, indignantly.\n\n\"Outrageous is the word. I thank you for it, my dear. I take you on trust, sir. You sit at my table, you have the honour to be included in my company, and to my face you have the audacity to advise me to become a thief--the worst kind of thief that is conceivable, a thief of spiritual things, a thief of ideas! It is insufferable, intolerable! I have been, I fear, deeply mistaken in you, monsieur; just as you appear to have been mistaken in me. I am not the scoundrel you suppose me, sir, and I will not number in my company a man who dares to suggest that I should become one. Outrageous!\"\n\nHe was very angry. His voice boomed through the little room, and the company sat hushed and something scared, their eyes upon Andre-Louis, who was the only one entirely unmoved by this outburst of virtuous indignation.\n\n\"You realize, monsieur,\" he said, very quietly, \"that you are insulting the memory of the illustrious dead?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Binet.\n\nAndre-Louis developed his sophistries.\n\n\"You insult the memory of Moliere, the greatest ornament of our stage, one of the greatest ornaments of our nation, when you suggest that there is vileness in doing that which he never hesitated to do, which no great author yet has hesitated to do. You cannot suppose that Moliere ever troubled himself to be original in the matter of ideas. You cannot suppose that the stories he tells in his plays have never been told before. They were culled, as you very well know--though you seem momentarily to have forgotten it, and it is therefore necessary that I should remind you--they were culled, many of them, from the Italian authors, who themselves had culled them Heaven alone knows where. Moliere took those old stories and retold them in his own language. That is precisely what I am suggesting that you should do. Your company is a company of improvisers. You supply the dialogue as you proceed, which is rather more than Moliere ever attempted. You may, if you prefer it--though it would seem to me to be yielding to an excess of scruple--go straight to Boccaccio or Sacchetti. But even then you cannot be sure that you have reached the sources.\"",
    "\"The door,\" Aline commanded her footman, and \"Mount here beside me,\" she commanded Andre-Louis, in the same breath.\n\n\"A moment, Aline.\"\n\nHe turned to his companion, who was all amazement, and to Harlequin and Columbine, who had that moment come up to share it. \"You permit me, Climene?\" said he, breathlessly. But it was more a statement than a question. \"Fortunately you are not alone. Harlequin will take care of you. Au revoir, at dinner.\"\n\nWith that he sprang into the cabriolet without waiting for a reply. The footman closed the door, the coachman cracked his whip, and the regal equipage rolled away along the quay, leaving the three comedians staring after it, open-mouthed... Then Harlequin laughed.\n\n\"A prince in disguise, our Scaramouche!\" said he.\n\nColumbine clapped her hands and flashed her strong teeth. \"But what a romance for you, Climene! How wonderful!\"\n\nThe frown melted from Climene's brow. Resentment changed to bewilderment.\n\n\"But who is she?\"\n\n\"His sister, of course,\" said Harlequin, quite definitely.\n\n\"His sister? How do you know?\"\n\n\"I know what he will tell you on his return.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Because you wouldn't believe him if he said she was his mother.\"\n\nFollowing the carriage with their glance, they wandered on in the direction it had taken. And in the carriage Aline was considering Andre-Louis with grave eyes, lips slightly compressed, and a tiny frown between her finely drawn eyebrows.\n\n\"You have taken to queer company, Andre,\" was the first thing she said to him. \"Or else I am mistaken in thinking that your companion was Mlle. Binet of the Theatre Feydau.\"\n\n\"You are not mistaken. But I had not imagined Mlle. Binet so famous already.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to that...\" mademoiselle shrugged, her tone quietly scornful. And she explained. \"It is simply that I was at the play last night. I thought I recognized her.\"\n\n\"You were at the Feydau last night? And I never saw you!\"\n\n\"Were you there, too?\"\n\n\"Was I there!\" he cried. Then he checked, and abruptly changed his tone. \"Oh, yes, I was there,\" he said, as commonplace as he could, beset by a sudden reluctance to avow that he had so willingly descended to depths that she must account unworthy, and grateful that his disguise of face and voice should have proved impenetrable even to one who knew him so very well.\n\n\"I understand,\" said she, and compressed her lips a little more tightly.\n\n\"But what do you understand?\"\n\n\"The rare attractions of Mlle. Binet. Naturally you would be at the theatre. Your tone conveyed it very clearly. Do you know that you disappoint me, Andre? It is stupid of me, perhaps; it betrays, I suppose, my imperfect knowledge of your sex. I am aware that most young men of fashion find an irresistible attraction for creatures who parade themselves upon the stage. But I did not expect you to ape the ways of a man of fashion. I was foolish enough to imagine you to be different; rather above such trivial pursuits. I conceived you something of an idealist.\"\n\n\"Sheer flattery.\"\n\n\"So I perceive. But you misled me. You talked so much morality of a kind, you made philosophy so readily, that I came to be deceived. In fact, your hypocrisy was so consummate that I never suspected it. With your gift of acting I wonder that you haven't joined Mlle. Binet's troupe.\"\n\n\"I have,\" said he.\n\nIt had really become necessary to tell her, making choice of the lesser of the two evils with which she confronted him.\n\nHe saw first incredulity, then consternation, and lastly disgust overspread her face.\n\n\"Of course,\" said she, after a long pause, \"that would have the advantage of bringing you closer to your charmer.\"\n\n\"That was only one of the inducements. There was another. Finding myself forced to choose between the stage and the gallows, I had the incredible weakness to prefer the former. It was utterly unworthy of a man of my lofty ideals, but--what would you? Like other ideologists, I find it easier to preach than to practise. Shall I stop the carriage and remove the contamination of my disgusting person? Or shall I tell you how it happened?\"\n\n\"Tell me how it happened first. Then we will decide.\"\n\nHe told her how he met the Binet Troupe, and how the men of the marechaussee forced upon him the discovery that in its bosom he could lie safely lost until the hue and cry had died down. The explanation dissolved her iciness.\n\n\"My poor Andre, why didn't you tell me this at first?\"\n\n\"For one thing, you didn't give me time; for another, I feared to shock you with the spectacle of my degradation.\"\n\nShe took him seriously. \"But where was the need of it? And why did you not send us word as I required you of your whereabouts?\"\n\n\"I was thinking of it only yesterday. I have hesitated for several reasons.\"\n\n\"You thought it would offend us to know what you were doing?\"\n\n\"I think that I preferred to surprise you by the magnitude of my ultimate achievements.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are to become a great actor?\" She was frankly scornful.\n\n\"That is not impossible. But I am more concerned to become a great author. There is no reason why you should sniff. The calling is an honourable one. All the world is proud to know such men as Beaumarchais and Chenier.\"\n\n\"And you hope to equal them?\"\n\n\"I hope to surpass them, whilst acknowledging that it was they who taught me how to walk. What did you think of the play last night?\"\n\n\"It was amusing and well conceived.\"\n\n\"Let me present you to the author.\"\n\n\"You? But the company is one of the improvisers.\"\n\n\"Even improvisers require an author to write their scenarios. That is all I write at present. Soon I shall be writing plays in the modern manner.\"\n\n\"You deceive yourself, my poor Andre. The piece last night would have been nothing without the players. You are fortunate in your Scaramouche.\"\n\n\"In confidence--I present you to him.\"\n\n\"You--Scaramouche? You?\" She turned to regard him fully. He smiled his close-lipped smile that made wrinkles like gashes in his cheeks. He nodded. \"And I didn't recognize you!\"\n\n\"I thank you for the tribute. You imagined, of course, that I was a scene-shifter. And now that you know all about me, what of Gavrillac? What of my godfather?\"\n\nHe was well, she told him, and still profoundly indignant with Andre-Louis for his defection, whilst secretly concerned on his behalf.\n\n\"I shall write to him to-day that I have seen you.\"\n\n\"Do so. Tell him that I am well and prospering. But say no more. Do not tell him what I am doing. He has his prejudices too. Besides, it might not be prudent. And now the question I have been burning to ask ever since I entered your carriage. Why are you in Nantes, Aline?\"\n\n\"I am on a visit to my aunt, Mme. de Sautron. It was with her that I came to the play yesterday. We have been dull at the chateau; but it will be different now. Madame my aunt is receiving several guests to-day. M. de La Tour d'Azyr is to be one of them.\"",
    "The thoughts that were stirring in him on that Monday morning, when it was discovered that Climene had not yet returned from her excursion of the previous day in the coach of M. le Marquis, were already wicked enough without the spurring they received from the distraught Leandre. Hitherto the attitude of each of these men towards the other had been one of mutual contempt. The phenomenon has frequently been observed in like cases. Now, what appeared to be a common misfortune brought them into a sort of alliance. So, at least, it seemed to Leandre when he went in quest of Andre-Louis, who with apparent unconcern was smoking a pipe upon the quay immediately facing the inn.\n\n\"Name of a pig!\" said Leandre. \"How can you take your ease and smoke at such a time?\"\n\nScaramouche surveyed the sky. \"I do not find it too cold,\" said he. \"The sun is shining. I am very well here.\"\n\n\"Do I talk of the weather?\" Leandre was very excited.\n\n\"Of what, then?\"\n\n\"Of Climene, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh! The lady has ceased to interest me,\" he lied.\n\nLeandre stood squarely in front of him, a handsome figure handsomely dressed in these days, his hair well powdered, his stockings of silk. His face was pale, his large eyes looked larger than usual.\n\n\"Ceased to interest you? Are you not to marry her?\"\n\nAndre-Louis expelled a cloud of smoke. \"You cannot wish to be offensive. Yet you almost suggest that I live on other men's leavings.\"\n\n\"My God!\" said Leandre, overcome, and he stared awhile. Then he burst out afresh. \"Are you quite heartless? Are you always Scaramouche?\"\n\n\"What do you expect me to do?\" asked Andre-Louis, evincing surprise in his own turn, but faintly.\n\n\"I do not expect you to let her go without a struggle.\"\n\n\"But she has gone already.\" Andre-Louis pulled at his pipe a moment, what time Leandre clenched and unclenched his hands in impotent rage. \"And to what purpose struggle against the inevitable? Did you struggle when I took her from you?\"\n\n\"She was not mine to be taken from me. I but aspired, and you won the race. But even had it been otherwise where is the comparison? That was a thing in honour; this--this is hell.\"\n\nHis emotion moved Andre-Louis. He took Leandre's arm. \"You're a good fellow, Leandre. I am glad I intervened to save you from your fate.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't love her!\" cried the other, passionately. \"You never did. You don't know what it means to love, or you'd not talk like this. My God! if she had been my affianced wife and this had happened, I should have killed the man--killed him! Do you hear me? But you... Oh, you, you come out here and smoke, and take the air, and talk of her as another man's leavings. I wonder I didn't strike you for the word.\"\n\nHe tore his arm from the other's grip, and looked almost as if he would strike him now.\n\n\"You should have done it,\" said Andre-Louis. \"It's in your part.\"\n\nWith an imprecation Leandre turned on his heel to go. Andre-Louis arrested his departure.\n\n\"A moment, my friend. Test me by yourself. Would you marry her now?\"\n\n\"Would I?\" The young man's eyes blazed with passion. \"Would I? Let her say that she will marry me, and I am her slave.\"\n\n\"Slave is the right word--a slave in hell.\"\n\n\"It would never be hell to me where she was, whatever she had done. I love her, man, I am not like you. I love her, do you hear me?\"\n\n\"I have known it for some time,\" said Andre-Louis. \"Though I didn't suspect your attack of the disease to be quite so violent. Well, God knows I loved her, too, quite enough to share your thirst for killing. For myself, the blue blood of La Tour d'Azyr would hardly quench this thirst. I should like to add to it the dirty fluid that flows in the veins of the unspeakable Binet.\"\n\nFor a second his emotion had been out of hand, and he revealed to Leandre in the mordant tone of those last words something of the fires that burned under his icy exterior. The young man caught him by the hand.\n\n\"I knew you were acting,\" said he. \"You feel--you feel as I do.\"\n\n\"Behold us, fellows in viciousness. I have betrayed myself, it seems. Well, and what now? Do you want to see this pretty Marquis torn limb from limb? I might afford you the spectacle.\"\n\n\"What?\" Leandre stared, wondering was this another of Scaramouche's cynicisms.\n\n\"It isn't really difficult provided I have aid. I require only a little. Will you lend it me?\"\n\n\"Anything you ask,\" Leandre exploded. \"My life if you require it.\"\n\nAndre-Louis took his arm again. \"Let us walk,\" he said. \"I will instruct you.\"\n\n\nWhen they came back the company was already at dinner. Mademoiselle had not yet returned. Sullenness presided at the table. Columbine and Madame wore anxious expressions. The fact was that relations between Binet and his troupe were daily growing more strained.\n\nAndre-Louis and Leandre went each to his accustomed place. Binet's little eyes followed them with a malicious gleam, his thick lips pouted into a crooked smile.\n\n\"You two are grown very friendly of a sudden,\" he mocked.\n\n\"You are a man of discernment, Binet,\" said Scaramouche, the cold loathing of his voice itself an insult. \"Perhaps you discern the reason?\"\n\n\"It is readily discerned.\"\n\n\"Regale the company with it!\" he begged; and waited. \"What? You hesitate? Is it possible that there are limits to your shamelessness?\"\n\nBinet reared his great head. \"Do you want to quarrel with me, Scaramouche?\" Thunder was rumbling in his deep voice.\n\n\"Quarrel? You want to laugh. A man doesn't quarrel with creatures like you. We all know the place held in the public esteem by complacent husbands. But, in God's name, what place is there at all for complacent fathers?\"\n\nBinet heaved himself up, a great towering mass of manhood. Violently he shook off the restraining hand of Pierrot who sat on his left.\n\n\"A thousand devils!\" he roared; \"if you take that tone with me, I'll break every bone in your filthy body.\"\n\n\"If you were to lay a finger on me, Binet, you would give me the only provocation I still need to kill you.\" Andre-Louis was as calm as ever, and therefore the more menacing. Alarm stirred the company. He protruded from his pocket the butt of a pistol--newly purchased. \"I go armed, Binet. It is only fair to give you warning. Provoke me as you have suggested, and I'll kill you with no more compunction than I should kill a slug, which after all is the thing you most resemble--a slug, Binet; a fat, slimy body; foulness without soul and without intelligence. When I come to think of it I can't suffer to sit at table with you. It turns my stomach.\"\n\nHe pushed away his platter and got up. \"I'll go and eat at the ordinary below stairs.\"\n\nThereupon up jumped Columbine.\n\n\"And I'll come with you, Scaramouche!\" cried she.\n\nIt acted like a signal. Had the thing been concerted it couldn't have fallen out more uniformly. Binet, in fact, was persuaded of a conspiracy. For in the wake of Columbine went Leandre, in the wake of Leandre, Polichinelle and then all the rest together, until Binet found himself sitting alone at the head of an empty table in an empty room--a badly shaken man whose rage could afford him no support against the dread by which he was suddenly invaded.\n\nHe sat down to think things out, and he was still at that melancholy occupation when perhaps a half-hour later his daughter entered the room, returned at last from her excursion.",
    "From the earnest and thoughtful study of the theories of others, it followed now--as not uncommonly happens--that Andre-Louis came to develop theories of his own. He lay one June morning on his little truckle bed in the alcove behind the academy, considering a passage that he had read last night in Danet on double and triple feints. It had seemed to him when reading it that Danet had stopped short on the threshold of a great discovery in the art of fencing. Essentially a theorist, Andre-Louis perceived the theory suggested, which Danet himself in suggesting it had not perceived. He lay now on his back, surveying the cracks in the ceiling and considering this matter further with the lucidity that early morning often brings to an acute intelligence. You are to remember that for close upon two months now the sword had been Andre-Louis' daily exercise and almost hourly thought. Protracted concentration upon the subject was giving him an extraordinary penetration of vision. Swordsmanship as he learnt and taught and saw it daily practised consisted of a series of attacks and parries, a series of disengages from one line into another. But always a limited series. A half-dozen disengages on either side was, strictly speaking, usually as far as any engagement went. Then one recommenced. But even so, these disengages were fortuitous. What if from first to last they should be calculated?\n\nThat was part of the thought--one of the two legs on which his theory was to stand; the other was: what would happen if one so elaborated Danet's ideas on the triple feint as to merge them into a series of actual calculated disengages to culminate at the fourth or fifth or even sixth disengage? That is to say, if one were to make a series of attacks inviting ripostes again to be countered, each of which was not intended to go home, but simply to play the opponent's blade into a line that must open him ultimately, and as predetermined, for an irresistible lunge. Each counter of the opponent's would have to be preconsidered in this widening of his guard, a widening so gradual that he should himself be unconscious of it, and throughout intent upon getting home his own point on one of those counters.\n\nAndre-Louis had been in his time a chess-player of some force, and at chess he had excelled by virtue of his capacity for thinking ahead. That virtue applied to fencing should all but revolutionize the art. It was so applied already, of course, but only in an elementary and very limited fashion, in mere feints, single, double, or triple. But even the triple feint should be a clumsy device compared with this method upon which he theorized.\n\nHe considered further, and the conviction grew that he held the key of a discovery. He was impatient to put his theory to the test.\n\nThat morning he was given a pupil of some force, against whom usually he was hard put to it to defend himself. Coming on guard, he made up his mind to hit him on the fourth disengage, predetermining the four passes that should lead up to it. They engaged in tierce, and Andre-Louis led the attack by a beat and a straightening of the arm. Came the demi-contre he expected, which he promptly countered by a thrust in quinte; this being countered again, he reentered still lower, and being again correctly parried, as he had calculated, he lunged swirling his point into carte, and got home full upon his opponent's breast. The ease of it surprised him.\n\nThey began again. This time he resolved to go in on the fifth disengage, and in on that he went with the same ease. Then, complicating the matter further, he decided to try the sixth, and worked out in his mind the combination of the five preliminary engages. Yet again he succeeded as easily as before.\n\nThe young gentleman opposed to him laughed with just a tinge of mortification in his voice.\n\n\"I am all to pieces this morning,\" he said.\n\n\"You are not of your usual force,\" Andre-Louis politely agreed. And then greatly daring, always to test that theory of his to the uttermost: \"So much so,\" he added, \"that I could almost be sure of hitting you as and when I declare.\"\n\nThe capable pupil looked at him with a half-sneer. \"Ah, that, no,\" said he.\n\n\"Let us try. On the fourth disengage I shall touch you. Allons! En garde!\"\n\nAnd as he promised, so it happened.\n\nThe young gentleman who, hitherto, had held no great opinion of Andre-Louis' swordsmanship, accounting him well enough for purposes of practice when the master was otherwise engaged, opened wide his eyes. In a burst of mingled generosity and intoxication, Andre-Louis was almost for disclosing his method--a method which a little later was to become a commonplace of the fencing-rooms. Betimes he checked himself. To reveal his secret would be to destroy the prestige that must accrue to him from exercising it.\n\nAt noon, the academy being empty, M. des Amis called Andre-Louis to one of the occasional lessons which he still received. And for the first time in all his experience with Andre-Louis, M. des Amis received from him a full hit in the course of the first bout. He laughed, well pleased, like the generous fellow he was.\n\n\"Aha! You are improving very fast, my friend.\" He still laughed, though not so well pleased, when he was hit in the second bout. After that he settled down to fight in earnest with the result that Andre-Louis was hit three times in succession. The speed and accuracy of the fencing-master when fully exerting himself disconcerted Andre-Louis' theory, which for want of being exercised in practice still demanded too much consideration.\n\nBut that his theory was sound he accounted fully established, and with that, for the moment, he was content. It remained only to perfect by practice the application of it. To this he now devoted himself with the passionate enthusiasm of the discoverer. He confined himself to a half-dozen combinations, which he practised assiduously until each had become almost automatic. And he proved their infallibility upon the best among M. des Amis' pupils.\n\nFinally, a week or so after that last bout of his with des Amis, the master called him once more to practice.\n\nHit again in the first bout, the master set himself to exert all his skill against his assistant. But to-day it availed him nothing before Andre-Louis' impetuous attacks.\n\nAfter the third hit, M. des Amis stepped back and pulled off his mask.\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked. He was pale, and his dark brows were contracted in a frown. Not in years had he been so wounded in his self-love. \"Have you been taught a secret botte?\"\n\nHe had always boasted that he knew too much about the sword to believe any nonsense about secret bottes; but this performance of Andre-Louis' had shaken his convictions on that score.\n\n\"No,\" said Andre-Louis. \"I have been working hard; and it happens that I fence with my brains.\"\n\n\"So I perceive. Well, well, I think I have taught you enough, my friend. I have no intention of having an assistant who is superior to myself.\"\n\n\"Little danger of that,\" said Andre-Louis, smiling pleasantly. \"You have been fencing hard all morning, and you are tired, whilst I, having done little, am entirely fresh. That is the only secret of my momentary success.\"\n\nHis tact and the fundamental good-nature of M. des Amis prevented the matter from going farther along the road it was almost threatening to take. And thereafter, when they fenced together, Andre-Louis, who continued daily to perfect his theory into an almost infallible system, saw to it that M. des Amis always scored against him at least two hits for every one of his own. So much he would grant to discretion, but no more. He desired that M. des Amis should be conscious of his strength, without, however, discovering so much of its real extent as would have excited in him an unnecessary degree of jealousy.",
    "M. Le Chevalier de Chabrillane had been closely connected, you will remember, with the iniquitous affair in which Philippe de Vilmorin had lost his life. We know enough to justify a surmise that he had not merely been La Tour d'Azyr's second in the encounter, but actually an instigator of the business. Andre-Louis may therefore have felt a justifiable satisfaction in offering up the Chevalier's life to the Manes of his murdered friend. He may have viewed it as an act of common justice not to be procured by any other means. Also it is to be remembered that Chabrillane had gone confidently to the meeting, conceiving that he, a practised ferailleur, had to deal with a bourgeois utterly unskilled in swordsmanship. Morally, then, he was little better than a murderer, and that he should have tumbled into the pit he conceived that he dug for Andre-Louis was a poetic retribution. Yet, notwithstanding all this, I should find the cynical note on which Andre-Louis announced the issue to the Assembly utterly detestable did I believe it sincere. It would justify Aline of the expressed opinion, which she held in common with so many others who had come into close contact with him, that Andre-Louis was quite heartless.\n\nYou have seen something of the same heartlessness in his conduct when he discovered the faithlessness of La Binet although he had himself been faithless to her from the moment of his meeting with Aline de Kercadiou. But I am disposed to believe that in both cases he was acting a part, deliberately assuming a cynicism that was foreign to his nature, so as to mask the pain he was suffering.\n\nM. le Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr shook himself out of the gloomy abstraction in which he had sat. The successor of the deputy he had slain must, in any event, be an object of grim interest to him. You conceive how that interest was heightened when he heard him named, when, looking across, he recognized indeed in this Andre-Louis Moreau the young scoundrel who was continually crossing his path, continually exerting against him a deep-moving, sinister influence to make him regret that he should have spared his life that day at Gavrillac two years ago. That he should thus have stepped into the shoes of Lagron seemed to M. de La Tour d'Azyr too apt for mere coincidence, a direct challenge in itself.\n\nHe looked at the young man in wonder rather than in anger, and looking at him he was filled by a vague, almost a premonitory, uneasiness.\n\nAt the very outset, the presence which in itself he conceived to be a challenge was to demonstrate itself for this in no equivocal terms.\n\n\"I come before you,\" Andre-Louis began, \"as a deputy-suppleant to fill the place of one who was murdered some three weeks ago.\"\n\nIt was a challenging opening that instantly provoked an indignant outcry from the Blacks. Andre-Louis paused, and looked at them, smiling a little, a singularly self-confident young man.\n\n\"The gentlemen of the Right, M. le President, do not appear to like my words. But that is not surprising. The gentlemen of the Right notoriously do not like the truth.\"\n\nThis time there was uproar. The members of the Left roared with laughter, those of the Right thundered menacingly. The ushers circulated at a pace beyond their usual, agitated themselves, clapped their hands, and called in vain for silence.\n\nThe President rang his bell.\n\nAbove the general din came the voice of La Tour d'Azyr, who had half-risen from his seat: \"Mountebank! This is not the theatre!\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, it is becoming a hunting-ground for bully-swordsmen,\" was the answer, and the uproar grew.\n\nThe deputy-suppleant looked round and waited. Near at hand he met the encouraging grin of Le Chapelier, and the quiet, approving smile of Kersain, another Breton deputy of his acquaintance. A little farther off he saw the great head of Mirabeau thrown back, the great eyes regarding him from under a frown in a sort of wonder, and yonder, among all that moving sea of faces, the sallow countenance of the Arras' lawyer Robespierre--or de Robespierre, as the little snob now called himself, having assumed the aristocratic particle as the prerogative of a man of his distinction in the councils of his country. With his tip-tilted nose in the air, his carefully curled head on one side, the deputy for Arras was observing Andre-Louis attentively. The horn-rimmed spectacles he used for reading were thrust up on to his pale forehead, and it was through a levelled spy-glass that he considered the speaker, his thin-lipped mouth stretched a little in that tiger-cat smile that was afterwards to become so famous and so feared.\n\nGradually the uproar wore itself out, and diminished so that at last the President could make himself heard. Leaning forward, he gravely addressed the young man in the tribune:\n\n\"Monsieur, if you wish to be heard, let me beg of you not to be provocative in your language.\" And then to the others: \"Messieurs, if we are to proceed, I beg that you will restrain your feelings until the deputy-suppleant has concluded his discourse.\"\n\n\"I shall endeavour to obey, M. le President, leaving provocation to the gentlemen of the Right. If the few words I have used so far have been provocative, I regret it. But it was necessary that I should refer to the distinguished deputy whose place I come so unworthily to fill, and it was unavoidable that I should refer to the event which has procured us this sad necessity. The deputy Lagron was a man of singular nobility of mind, a selfless, dutiful, zealous man, inflamed by the high purpose of doing his duty by his electors and by this Assembly. He possessed what his opponents would call a dangerous gift of eloquence.\"\n\nLa Tour d'Azyr writhed at the well-known phrase--his own phrase--the phrase that he had used to explain his action in the matter of Philippe de Vilmorin, the phrase that from time to time had been cast in his teeth with such vindictive menace.\n\nAnd then the crisp voice of the witty Canales, that very rapier of the Privileged party, cut sharply into the speaker's momentary pause.\n\n\"M. le President,\" he asked with great solemnity, \"has the deputy-suppleant mounted the tribune for the purpose of taking part in the debate on the constitution of the legislative assemblies, or for the purpose of pronouncing a funeral oration upon the departed deputy Lagron?\"\n\nThis time it was the Blacks who gave way to mirth, until checked by the deputy-suppleant.\n\n\"That laughter is obscene!\" In this truly Gallic fashion he flung his glove into the face of Privilege, determined, you see, upon no half measures; and the rippling laughter perished on the instant quenched in speechless fury.\n\nSolemnly he proceeded. \"You all know how Lagron died. To refer to his death at all requires courage, to laugh in referring to it requires something that I will not attempt to qualify. If I have alluded to his decease, it is because my own appearance among you seemed to render some such allusion necessary. It is mine to take up the burden which he set down. I do not pretend that I have the strength, the courage, or the wisdom of Lagron; but with every ounce of such strength and courage and wisdom as I possess that burden will I bear. And I trust, for the sake of those who might attempt it, that the means taken to impose silence upon that eloquent voice will not be taken to impose silence upon mine.\"\n\nThere was a faint murmur of applause from the Left, splutter of contemptuous laughter from the Right. \"Rhodomont!\" a voice called to him. He looked in the direction of that voice, proceeding from the group of spadassins amid the Blacks across the Piste, and he smiled. Inaudibly his lips answered: \"No, my friend--Scaramouche; Scaramouche, the subtle, dangerous fellow who goes tortuously to his ends.\" Aloud, he resumed: \"M. le President, there are those who will not understand that the purpose for which we are assembled here is the making of laws by which France may be equitably governed, by which France may be lifted out of the morass of bankruptcy into which she is in danger of sinking. For there are some who want, it seems, not laws, but blood; I solemnly warn them that this blood will end by choking them, if they do not learn in time to discard force and allow reason to prevail.\"",
    "Nobody laughed now at his flippancy. He did not intend that anybody should. He intended to be terrible; and he knew that the more flippant and casual his tone, the more terrible would be its effect. He produced exactly the effect he desired.\n\nWhat followed in a place where feelings and practices had become what they had become is not difficult to surmise. When the session rose, there were a dozen spadassins awaiting him in the vestibule, and this time the men of his own party were less concerned to guard him. He seemed so entirely capable of guarding himself; he appeared, for all his circumspection, to have so completely carried the war into the enemy's camp, so completely to have adopted their own methods, that his fellows scarcely felt the need to protect him as yesterday.\n\nAs he emerged, he scanned that hostile file, whose air and garments marked them so clearly for what they were. He paused, seeking the man he expected, the man he was most anxious to oblige. But M. de La Tour d'Azyr was absent from those eager ranks. This seemed to him odd. La Tour d'Azyr was Chabrillane's cousin and closest friend. Surely he should have been among the first to-day. The fact was that La Tour d'Azyr was too deeply overcome by amazement and grief at the utterly unexpected event. Also his vindictiveness was held curiously in leash. Perhaps he, too, remembered the part played by Chabrillane in the affair at Gavrillac, and saw in this obscure Andre-Louis Moreau, who had so persistently persecuted him ever since, an ordained avenger. The repugnance he felt to come to the point, with him, particularly after this culminating provocation, was puzzling even to himself. But it existed, and it curbed him now.\n\nTo Andre-Louis, since La Tour was not one of that waiting pack, it mattered little on that Tuesday morning who should be the next. The next, as it happened, was the young Vicomte de La Motte-Royau, one of the deadliest blades in the group.\n\nOn the Wednesday morning, coming again an hour or so late to the Assembly, Andre-Louis announced--in much the same terms as he had announced the death of Chabrillane--that M. de La Motte-Royau would probably not disturb the harmony of the Assembly for some weeks to come, assuming that he were so fortunate as to recover ultimately from the effects of an unpleasant accident with which he had quite unexpectedly had the misfortune to meet that morning.\n\nOn Thursday he made an identical announcement with regard to the Vidame de Blavon. On Friday he told them that he had been delayed by M. de Troiscantins, and then turning to the members of the Cote Droit, and lengthening his face to a sympathetic gravity:\n\n\"I am glad to inform you, messieurs, that M. des Troiscantins is in the hands of a very competent surgeon who hopes with care to restore him to your councils in a few weeks' time.\"\n\nIt was paralyzing, fantastic, unreal; and friend and foe in that assembly sat alike stupefied under those bland daily announcements. Four of the most redoubtable spadassinicides put away for a time, one of them dead--and all this performed with such an air of indifference and announced in such casual terms by a wretched little provincial lawyer!\n\nHe began to assume in their eyes a romantic aspect. Even that group of philosophers of the Cote Gauche, who refused to worship any force but the force of reason, began to look upon him with a respect and consideration which no oratorical triumphs could ever have procured him.\n\nAnd from the Assembly the fame of him oozed out gradually over Paris. Desmoulins wrote a panegyric upon him in his paper \"Les Revolutions,\" wherein he dubbed him the \"Paladin of the Third Estate,\" a name that caught the fancy of the people, and clung to him for some time. Disdainfully was he mentioned in the \"Actes des Apotres,\" the mocking organ of the Privileged party, so light-heartedly and provocatively edited by a group of gentlemen afflicted by a singular mental myopy.\n\nThe Friday of that very busy week in the life of this young man who even thereafter is to persist in reminding us that he is not in any sense a man of action, found the vestibule of the Manege empty of swordsmen when he made his leisurely and expectant egress between Le Chapelier and Kersain.\n\nSo surprised was he that he checked in his stride.\n\n\"Have they had enough?\" he wondered, addressing the question to Le Chapelier.\n\n\"They have had enough of you, I should think,\" was the answer. \"They will prefer to turn their attention to some one less able to take care of himself.\"\n\nNow this was disappointing. Andre-Louis had lent himself to this business with a very definite object in view. The slaying of Chabrillane had, as far as it went, been satisfactory. He had regarded that as a sort of acceptable hors d'oeuvre. But the three who had followed were no affair of his at all. He had met them with a certain amount of repugnance, and dealt with each as lightly as consideration of his own safety permitted. Was the baiting of him now to cease whilst the man at whom he aimed had not presented himself? In that case it would be necessary to force the pace!\n\nOut there under the awning a group of gentlemen stood in earnest talk. Scanning the group in a rapid glance, Andre-Louis perceived M. de La Tour d'Azyr amongst them. He tightened his lips. He must afford no provocation. It must be for them to fasten their quarrels upon him. Already the \"Actes des Apotres\" that morning had torn the mask from his face, and proclaimed him the fencing-master of the Rue du Hasard, successor to Bertrand des Amis. Hazardous as it had been hitherto for a man of his condition to engage in single combat it was rendered doubly so by this exposure, offered to the public as an aristocratic apologia.\n\nStill, matters could not be left where they were, or he should have had all his pains for nothing. Carefully looking away from that group of gentlemen, he raised his voice so that his words must carry to their ears.\n\n\"It begins to look as if my fears of having to spend the remainder of my days in the Bois were idle.\"\n\nOut of the corner of his eye he caught the stir his words created in that group. Its members had turned to look at him; but for the moment that was all. A little more was necessary. Pacing slowly along between his friends he resumed:\n\n\"But is it not remarkable that the assassin of Lagron should make no move against Lagron's successor? Or perhaps it is not remarkable. Perhaps there are good reasons. Perhaps the gentleman is prudent.\"\n\nHe had passed the group by now, and he left that last sentence of his to trail behind him, and after it sent laughter, insolent and provoking.",
    "The carriage rolled across the Place Louis XV and out on to the Cours la Reine at last. Along that beautiful, tree-bordered avenue between the Champs Elysees and the Seine, almost empty at this hour of the day, they made better speed, leaving now a cloud of dust behind them.\n\nBut fast to danger-point as was the speed, to the women in that carriage it was too slow. As they reached the barrier at the end of the Cours, nine o'clock was striking in the city behind them, and every stroke of it seemed to sound a note of doom.\n\nYet here at the barrier the regulations compelled a momentary halt. Aline enquired of the sergeant-in-charge how long it was since a cabriolet such as she described had gone that way. She was answered that some twenty minutes ago a vehicle had passed the barrier containing the deputy M. le Chapelier and the Paladin of the Third Estate, M. Moreau. The sergeant was very well informed. He could make a shrewd guess, he said, with a grin, of the business that took M. Moreau that way so early in the day.\n\nThey left him, to speed on now through the open country, following the road that continued to hug the river. They sat back mutely despairing, staring hopelessly ahead, Aline's hand clasped tight in madame's. In the distance, across the meadows on their right, they could see already the long, dusky line of trees of the Bois, and presently the carriage swung aside following a branch of the road that turned to the right, away from the river and heading straight for the forest.\n\nMademoiselle broke at last the silence of hopelessness that had reigned between them since they had passed the barrier.\n\n\"Oh, it is impossible that we should come in time! Impossible!\"\n\n\"Don't say it! Don't say it!\" madame cried out.\n\n\"But it is long past nine, madame! Andre would be punctual, and these... affairs do not take long. It... it will be all over by now.\"\n\nMadame shivered, and closed her eyes. Presently, however, she opened them again, and stirred. Then she put her head from the window. \"A carriage is approaching,\" she announced, and her tone conveyed the thing she feared.\n\n\"Not already! Oh, not already!\" Thus Aline expressed the silently communicated thought. She experienced a difficulty in breathing, felt the sudden need of air. Something in her throat was throbbing as if it would suffocate her; a mist came and went before her eyes.\n\nIn a cloud of dust an open caleche was speeding towards them, coming from the Bois. They watched it, both pale, neither venturing to speak, Aline, indeed, without breath to do so.\n\nAs it approached, it slowed down, perforce, as they did, to effect a safe passage in that narrow road. Aline was at the window with Mme. de Plougastel, and with fearful eyes both looked into this open carriage that was drawing abreast of them.\n\n\"Which of them is it, madame? Oh, which of them?\" gasped Aline, scarce daring to look, her senses swimming.\n\nOn the near side sat a swarthy young gentleman unknown to either of the ladies. He was smiling as he spoke to his companion. A moment later and the man sitting beyond came into view. He was not smiling. His face was white and set, and it was the face of the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.\n\nFor a long moment, in speechless horror, both women stared at him, until, perceiving them, blankest surprise invaded his stern face.\n\nIn that moment, with a long shuddering sigh Aline sank swooning to the carriage floor behind Mme. de Plougastel.\n\nBy fast driving Andre-Louis had reached the ground some minutes ahead of time, notwithstanding the slight delay in setting out. There he had found M. de La Tour d'Azyr already awaiting him, supported by a M. d'Ormesson, a swarthy young gentleman in the blue uniform of a captain in the Gardes du Corps.\n\nAndre-Louis had been silent and preoccupied throughout that drive. He was perturbed by his last interview with Mademoiselle de Kercadiou and the rash inferences which he had drawn as to her motives.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" he had said, \"this man must be killed.\"\n\nLe Chapelier had not answered him. Almost, indeed, had the Breton shuddered at his compatriot's cold-bloodedness. He had often of late thought that this fellow Moreau was hardly human. Also he had found him incomprehensibly inconsistent. When first this spadassinicide business had been proposed to him, he had been so very lofty and disdainful. Yet, having embraced it, he went about it at times with a ghoulish flippancy that was revolting, at times with a detachment that was more revolting still.",
    "The door opened again, and Jacques reappeared; after him, stepping briskly past him, came a slight man in a wide-brimmed hat, adorned by a tricolour cockade. About the waist of an olive-green riding-coat he wore a broad tricolour sash; a sword hung at his side.\n\nHe swept off his hat, and the candlelight glinted on the steel buckle in front of it. Madame found herself silently regarded by a pair of large, dark eyes set in a lean, brown face, eyes that were most singularly intent and searching.\n\nShe leaned forward, incredulity swept across her countenance. Then her eyes kindled, and the colour came creeping back into her pale cheeks. She rose suddenly. She was trembling.\n\n\"Andre-Louis!\" she exclaimed.\n\nThat gift of laughter of his seemed utterly extinguished. For once there was no gleam of humour in those dark eyes, as they continued to consider her with that queer stare of scrutiny. And yet, though his gaze was sombre, his thoughts were not. With his cruelly true mental vision which pierced through shams, and his capacity for detached observation--which properly applied might have carried him very far, indeed--he perceived the grotesqueness, the artificiality of the emotion which in that moment he experienced, but by which he refused to be possessed. It sprang entirely from the consciousness that she was his mother; as if, all things considered, the more or less accidental fact that she had brought him into the world could establish between them any real bond at this time of day! The motherhood that bears and forsakes is less than animal. He had considered this; he had been given ample leisure in which to consider it during those long, turbulent hours in which he had been forced to wait, because it would have been almost impossible to have won across that seething city, and certainly unwise to have attempted so to do.\n\nHe had reached the conclusion that by consenting to go to her rescue at such a time he stood committed to a piece of purely sentimental quixotry. The quittances which the Mayor of Meudon had exacted from him before he would issue the necessary safe-conducts placed the whole of his future, perhaps his very life, in jeopardy. And he had consented to do this not for the sake of a reality, but out of regard for an idea--he who all his life had avoided the false lure of worthless and hollow sentimentality.\n\nThus thought Andre-Louis as he considered her now so searchingly, finding it, naturally enough, a matter of extraordinary interest to look consciously upon his mother for the first time at the age of eight-and-twenty.\n\nFrom her he looked at last at Jacques, who remained at attention, waiting by the open door.\n\n\"Could we be alone, madame?\" he asked her.\n\nShe waved the footman away, and the door closed. In agitated silence, unquestioning, she waited for him to account for his presence there at so extraordinary a time.\n\n\"Rougane could not return,\" he informed her shortly. \"At M. de Kercadiou's request, I come instead.\"\n\n\"You! You are sent to rescue us!\" The note of amazement in her voice was stronger than that of her relief.\n\n\"That, and to make your acquaintance, madame.\"\n\n\"To make my acquaintance? But what do you mean, Andre-Louis?\"\n\n\"This letter from M. de Kercadiou will tell you.\" Intrigued by his odd words and odder manner, she took the folded sheet. She broke the seal with shaking hands, and with shaking hands approached the written page to the light. Her eyes grew troubled as she read; the shaking of her hands increased, and midway through that reading a moan escaped her. One glance that was almost terror she darted at the slim, straight man standing so incredibly impassive upon the edge of the light, and then she endeavoured to read on. But the crabbed characters of M. de Kercadiou swam distortedly under her eyes. She could not read. Besides, what could it matter what else he said. She had read enough. The sheet fluttered from her hands to the table, and out of a face that was like a face of wax, she looked now with a wistfulness, a sadness indescribable, at Andre-Louis.\n\n\"And so you know, my child?\" Her voice was stifled to a whisper.\n\n\"I know, madame my mother.\"\n\nThe grimness, the subtle blend of merciless derision and reproach in which it was uttered completely escaped her. She cried out at the new name. For her in that moment time and the world stood still. Her peril there in Paris as the wife of an intriguer at Coblenz was blotted out, together with every other consideration--thrust out of a consciousness that could find room for nothing else beside the fact that she stood acknowledged by her only son, this child begotten in adultery, borne furtively and in shame in a remote Brittany village eight-and-twenty years ago. Not even a thought for the betrayal of that inviolable secret, or the consequences that might follow, could she spare in this supreme moment."

  "Anthony Hope -- Rupert of Hentzau: From The Memoirs of Fritz Von Tarlenheim": [
    "A man who has lived in the world, marking how every act, although in itself perhaps light and insignificant, may become the source of consequences that spread far and wide, and flow for years or centuries, could scarcely feel secure in reckoning that with the death of the Duke of Strelsau and the restoration of King Rudolf to liberty and his throne, there would end, for good and all, the troubles born of Black Michael\u2019s daring conspiracy. The stakes had been high, the struggle keen; the edge of passion had been sharpened, and the seeds of enmity sown. Yet Michael, having struck for the crown, had paid for the blow with his life: should there not then be an end? Michael was dead, the Princess her cousin\u2019s wife, the story in safe keeping, and Mr. Rassendyll\u2019s face seen no more in Ruritania. Should there not then be an end? So said I to my friend the Constable of Zenda, as we talked by the bedside of Marshal Strakencz. The old man, already nearing the death that soon after robbed us of his aid and counsel, bowed his head in assent: in the aged and ailing the love of peace breeds hope of it. But Colonel Sapt tugged at his gray moustache, and twisted his black cigar in his mouth, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re very sanguine, friend Fritz. But is Rupert of Hentzau dead? I had not heard it.\u201d\n\nWell said, and like old Sapt! Yet the man is little without the opportunity, and Rupert by himself could hardly have troubled our repose. Hampered by his own guilt, he dared not set his foot in the kingdom from which by rare good luck he had escaped, but wandered to and fro over Europe, making a living by his wits, and, as some said, adding to his resources by gallantries for which he did not refuse substantial recompense. But he kept himself constantly before our eyes, and never ceased to contrive how he might gain permission to return and enjoy the estates to which his uncle\u2019s death had entitled him. The chief agent through whom he had the effrontery to approach the king was his relative, the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim, a young man of high rank and great wealth who was devoted to Rupert. The count fulfilled his mission well: acknowledging Rupert\u2019s heavy offences, he put forward in his behalf the pleas of youth and of the predominant influence which Duke Michael had exercised over his adherent, and promised, in words so significant as to betray Rupert\u2019s own dictation, a future fidelity no less discreet than hearty. \u201cGive me my price and I\u2019ll hold my tongue,\u201d seemed to come in Rupert\u2019s off-hand accents through his cousin\u2019s deferential lips. As may be supposed, however, the king and those who advised him in the matter, knowing too well the manner of man the Count of Hentzau was, were not inclined to give ear to his ambassador\u2019s prayer. We kept firm hold on Master Rupert\u2019s revenues, and as good watch as we could on his movements; for we were most firmly determined that he should never return to Ruritania. Perhaps we might have obtained his extradition and hanged him on the score of his crimes; but in these days every rogue who deserves no better than to be strung up to the nearest tree must have what they call a fair trial; and we feared that, if Rupert were handed over to our police and arraigned before the courts at Strelsau, the secret which we guarded so sedulously would become the gossip of all the city, ay, and of all Europe. So Rupert went unpunished except by banishment and the impounding of his rents.\n\nYet Sapt was in the right about him. Helpless as he seemed, he did not for an instant abandon the contest. He lived in the faith that his chance would come, and from day to day was ready for its coming. He schemed against us as we schemed to protect ourselves from him; if we watched him, he kept his eye on us. His ascendency over Luzau-Rischenheim grew markedly greater after a visit which his cousin paid to him in Paris. From this time the young count began to supply him with resources. Thus armed, he gathered instruments round him and organized a system of espionage that carried to his ears all our actions and the whole position of affairs at court. He knew, far more accurately than anyone else outside the royal circle, the measures taken for the government of the kingdom and the considerations that dictated the royal policy. More than this, he possessed himself of every detail concerning the king\u2019s health, although the utmost reticence was observed on this subject. Had his discoveries stopped there, they would have been vexatious and disquieting, but perhaps of little serious harm. They went further. Set on the track by his acquaintance with what had passed during Mr. Rassendyll\u2019s tenure of the throne, he penetrated the secret which had been kept successfully from the king himself. In the knowledge of it he found the opportunity for which he had waited; in its bold use he discerned his chance. I cannot say whether he were influenced more strongly by his desire to reestablish his position in the kingdom or by the grudge he bore against Mr. Rassendyll. He loved power and money; dearly he loved revenge also. No doubt both motives worked together, and he was rejoiced to find that the weapon put into his hand had a double edge; with one he hoped to cut his own path clear; with the other, to wound the man he hated through the woman whom that man loved. In fine, the Count of Hentzau, shrewdly discerning the feeling that existed between the queen and Rudolf Rassendyll, set his spies to work, and was rewarded by discovering the object of my yearly meetings with Mr. Rassendyll. At least he conjectured the nature of my errand; this was enough for him. Head and hand were soon busy in turning the knowledge to account; scruples of the heart never stood in Rupert\u2019s way.\n\nThe marriage which had set all Ruritania on fire with joy and formed in the people\u2019s eyes the visible triumph over Black Michael and his fellow-conspirators was now three years old. For three years the Princess Flavia had been queen. I am come by now to the age when a man should look out on life with an eye undimmed by the mists of passion. My love-making days are over; yet there is nothing for which I am more thankful to Almighty God than the gift of my wife\u2019s love. In storm it has been my anchor, and in clear skies my star. But we common folk are free to follow our hearts; am I an old fool for saying that he is a fool who follows anything else? Our liberty is not for princes. We need wait for no future world to balance the luck of men; even here there is an equipoise. From the highly placed a price is exacted for their state, their wealth, and their honors, as heavy as these are great; to the poor, what is to us mean and of no sweetness may appear decked in the robes of pleasure and delight. Well, if it were not so, who could sleep at nights? The burden laid on Queen Flavia I knew, and know, so well as a man can know it. I think it needs a woman to know it fully; for even now my wife\u2019s eyes fill with tears when we speak of it. Yet she bore it, and if she failed in anything, I wonder that it was in so little. For it was not only that she had never loved the king and had loved another with all her heart. The king\u2019s health, shattered by the horror and rigors of his imprisonment in the castle of Zenda, soon broke utterly. He lived, indeed; nay, he shot and hunted, and kept in his hand some measure, at least, of government. But always from the day of his release he was a fretful invalid, different utterly from the gay and jovial prince whom Michael\u2019s villains had caught in the shooting lodge. There was worse than this. As time went on, the first impulse of gratitude and admiration that he had felt towards Mr. Rassendyll died away. He came to brood more and more on what had passed while he was a prisoner; he was possessed not only by a haunting dread of Rupert of Hentzau, at whose hands he had suffered so greatly, but also by a morbid, half mad jealousy of Mr. Rassendyll. Rudolf had played the hero while he lay helpless. Rudolf\u2019s were the exploits for which his own people cheered him in his own capital. Rudolf\u2019s were the laurels that crowned his impatient brow. He had enough nobility to resent his borrowed credit, without the fortitude to endure it manfully. And the hateful comparison struck him nearer home. Sapt would tell him bluntly that Rudolf did this or that, set this precedent or that, laid down this or the other policy, and that the king could do no better than follow in Rudolf\u2019s steps. Mr. Rassendyll\u2019s name seldom passed his wife\u2019s lips, but when she spoke of him it was as one speaks of a great man who is dead, belittling all the living by the shadow of his name. I do not believe that the king discerned that truth which his wife spent her days in hiding from him; yet he was uneasy if Rudolf\u2019s name were mentioned by Sapt or myself, and from the queen\u2019s mouth he could not bear it. I have seen him fall into fits of passion on the mere sound of it; for he lost control of himself on what seemed slight provocation.",
    "The arrangements for my meeting with Mr. Rassendyll had been carefully made by correspondence before he left England. He was to be at the Golden Lion Hotel at eleven o\u2019clock on the night of the 15th of October. I reckoned to arrive in the town between eight and nine on the same evening, to proceed to another hotel, and, on pretence of taking a stroll, slip out and call on him at the appointed hour. I should then fulfil my commission, take his answer, and enjoy the rare pleasure of a long talk with him. Early the next morning he would have left Wintenberg, and I should be on my way back to Strelsau. I knew that he would not fail to keep his appointment, and I was perfectly confident of being able to carry out the programme punctually; I had, however, taken the precaution of obtaining a week\u2019s leave of absence, in case any unforeseen accident should delay my return. Conscious of having done all I could to guard against misunderstanding or mishap, I got into the train in a tolerably peaceful frame of mind. The box was in my inner pocket, the letter in a portemonnaie. I could feel them both with my hand. I was not in uniform, but I took my revolver. Although I had no reason to anticipate any difficulties, I did not forget that what I carried must be protected at all hazards and all costs.\n\nThe weary night journey wore itself away. Bauer came to me in the morning, performed his small services, repacked my hand-bag, procured me some coffee, and left me. It was then about eight o\u2019clock; we had arrived at a station of some importance and were not to stop again till mid-day. I saw Bauer enter the second-class compartment in which he was traveling, and settled down in my own coupe. I think it was at this moment that the thought of Rischenheim came again into my head, and I found myself wondering why he clung to the hopeless idea of compassing Rupert\u2019s return and what business had taken him from Strelsau. But I made little of the matter, and, drowsy from a broken night\u2019s rest, soon fell into a doze. I was alone in the carriage and could sleep without fear or danger. I was awakened by our noontide halt. Here I saw Bauer again. After taking a basin of soup, I went to the telegraph bureau to send a message to my wife; the receipt of it would not merely set her mind at ease, but would also ensure word of my safe progress reaching the queen. As I entered the bureau I met Bauer coming out of it. He seemed rather startled at our encounter, but told me readily enough that he had been telegraphing for rooms at Wintenberg, a very needless precaution, since there was no danger of the hotel being full. In fact I was annoyed, as I especially wished to avoid calling attention to my arrival. However, the mischief was done, and to rebuke my servant might have aggravated it by setting his wits at work to find out my motive for secrecy. So I said nothing, but passed by him with a nod. When the whole circumstances came to light, I had reason to suppose that besides his message to the inn-keeper, Bauer sent one of a character and to a quarter unsuspected by me.\n\nWe stopped once again before reaching Wintenberg. I put my head out of the window to look about me, and saw Bauer standing near the luggage van. He ran to me eagerly, asking whether I required anything. I told him \u201cnothing\u201d; but instead of going away, he began to talk to me. Growing weary of him, I returned to my seat and waited impatiently for the train to go on. There was a further delay of five minutes, and then we started.\n\n\u201cThank goodness!\u201d I exclaimed, leaning back comfortably in my seat and taking a cigar from my case.\n\nBut in a moment the cigar rolled unheeded on to the floor, as I sprang eagerly to my feet and darted to the window. For just as we were clearing the station, I saw being carried past the carriage, on the shoulders of a porter, a bag which looked very much like mine. Bauer had been in charge of my bag, and it had been put in the van under his directions. It seemed unlikely that it should be taken out now by any mistake. Yet the bag I saw was very like the bag I owned. But I was not sure, and could have done nothing had I been sure. We were not to stop again before Wintenberg, and, with my luggage or without it, I myself must be in the town that evening.\n\nWe arrived punctual to our appointed time. I sat in the carriage a moment or two, expecting Bauer to open the door and relieve me of my small baggage. He did not come, so I got out. It seemed that I had few fellow-passengers, and these were quickly disappearing on foot or in carriages and carts that waited outside the station. I stood looking for my servant and my luggage. The evening was mild; I was encumbered with my hand-bag and a heavy fur coat. There were no signs either of Bauer or of baggage. I stayed where I was for five or six minutes. The guard of the train had disappeared, but presently I observed the station-master; he seemed to be taking a last glance round the premises. Going up to him I asked whether he had seen my servant; he could give me no news of him. I had no luggage ticket, for mine had been in Bauer\u2019s hands; but I prevailed on him to allow me to look at the baggage which had arrived; my property was not among it. The station-master was inclined, I think, to be a little skeptical as to the existence both of bag and of servant. His only suggestion was that the man must have been left behind accidentally. I pointed out that in this case he would not have had the bag with him, but that it would have come on in the train. The station-master admitted the force of my argument; he shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands out; he was evidently at the end of his resources.\n\nNow, for the first time and with sudden force, a doubt of Bauer\u2019s fidelity thrust itself into my mind. I remembered how little I knew of the fellow and how great my charge was. Three rapid movements of my hand assured me that letter, box, and revolver were in their respective places. If Bauer had gone hunting in the bag, he had drawn a blank. The station-master noticed nothing; he was stating at the dim gas lamp that hung from the roof. I turned to him.\n\n\u201cWell, tell him when he comes--\u201d I began.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t come to-night, now,\u201d interrupted the stationmaster, none too politely. \u201cNo other train arrives to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him when he does come to follow me at once to the Wintenbergerhof. I\u2019m going there immediately.\u201d For time was short, and I did not wish to keep Mr. Rassendyll waiting. Besides, in my new-born nervousness, I was anxious to accomplish my errand as soon as might be. What had become of Bauer? The thought returned, and now with it another, that seemed to connect itself in some subtle way with my present position: why and whither had the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim set out from Strelsau a day before I started on my journey to Wintenberg?\n\n\u201cIf he comes I\u2019ll tell him,\u201d said the station-master, and as he spoke he looked round the yard.",
    "Having come thus far in the story that I set out to tell, I have half a mind to lay down my pen, and leave untold how from the moment that Mr. Rassendyll came again to Zenda a fury of chance seemed to catch us all in a whirlwind, carrying us whither we would not, and ever driving us onwards to fresh enterprises, breathing into us a recklessness that stood at no obstacle, and a devotion to the queen and to the man she loved that swept away all other feeling. The ancients held there to be a fate which would have its fill, though women wept and men died, and none could tell whose was the guilt nor who fell innocent. Thus did they blindly wrong God\u2019s providence. Yet, save that we are taught to believe that all is ruled, we are as blind as they, and are still left wondering why all that is true and generous and love\u2019s own fruit must turn so often to woe and shame, exacting tears and blood. For myself I would leave the thing untold, lest a word of it should seem to stain her whom I serve; it is by her own command I write, that all may one day, in time\u2019s fullness, be truly known, and those condemn who are without sin, while they pity whose own hearts have fought the equal fight. So much for her and him; for us less needs be said. It was not ours to weigh her actions; we served her; him we had served. She was our queen; we bore Heaven a grudge that he was not our king. The worst of what befell was not of our own planning, no, nor of our hoping. It came a thunderbolt from the hand of Rupert, flung carelessly between a curse and a laugh; its coming entangled us more tightly in the net of circumstances. Then there arose in us that strange and overpowering desire of which I must tell later, filling us with a zeal to accomplish our purpose, and to force Mr. Rassendyll himself into the way we chose. Led by this star, we pressed on through the darkness, until at length the deeper darkness fell that stayed our steps. We also stand for judgment, even as she and he. So I will write; but I will write plainly and briefly, setting down what I must, and no more, yet seeking to give truly the picture of that time, and to preserve as long as may be the portrait of the man whose like I have not known. Yet the fear is always upon me that, failing to show him as he was, I may fail also in gaining an understanding of how he wrought on us, one and all, till his cause became in all things the right, and to seat him where he should be our highest duty and our nearest wish. For he said little, and that straight to the purpose; no high-flown words of his live in my memory. And he asked nothing for himself. Yet his speech and his eyes went straight to men\u2019s hearts and women\u2019s, so that they held their lives in an eager attendance on his bidding. Do I rave? Then Sapt was a raver too, for Sapt was foremost in the business.\n\nAt ten minutes to eight o\u2019clock, young Bernenstein, very admirably and smartly accoutred, took his stand outside the main entrance of the castle. He wore a confident air that became almost a swagger as he strolled to and fro past the motionless sentries. He had not long to wait. On the stroke of eight a gentleman, well-horsed but entirely unattended, rode up the carriage drive. Bernenstein, crying \u201cAh, it is the count!\u201d ran to meet him. Rischenheim dismounted, holding out his hand to the young officer.\n\n\u201cMy dear Bernenstein!\u201d said he, for they were acquainted with one another.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re punctual, my dear Rischenheim, and it\u2019s lucky, for the king awaits you most impatiently.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to find him up so soon,\u201d remarked Rischenheim.\n\n\u201cUp! He\u2019s been up these two hours. Indeed we\u2019ve had the devil of a time of it. Treat him carefully, my dear Count; he\u2019s in one of his troublesome humors. For example--but I mustn\u2019t keep you waiting. Pray follow me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but pray tell me. Otherwise I might say something unfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he woke at six; and when the barber came to trim his beard there were--imagine it, Count!--no less than seven gray hairs.\u201d The king fell into a passion. \u201cTake it off!\u201d he said. \u201cTake it off. I won\u2019t have a gray beard! Take it off!\u2019 Well what would you? A man is free to be shaved if he chooses, so much more a king. So it\u2019s taken off.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis beard!\u201d\n\n\u201cHis beard, my dear Count.\u201d Then, after thanking Heaven it was gone, and declaring he looked ten years younger, he cried, \u201cThe Count of Luzau-Rischenheim breakfasts with me to-day: what is there for breakfast?\u201d And he had the chef out of his bed and--\u201cBut, by heavens, I shall get into trouble if I stop here chattering. He\u2019s waiting most eagerly for you. Come along.\u201d And Bernenstein, passing his arm through the count\u2019s, walked him rapidly into the castle.",
    "While Sapt was making his arrangements, Queen Flavia came to the room where Rudolf Rassendyll was. It was then nearing twelve, and young Bernenstein had been gone half an hour. Sapt attended her to the door, set a sentry at the end of the passage with orders that her Majesty should on no pretence be disturbed, promised her very audibly to return as soon as he possibly could, and respectfully closed the door after she had entered. The constable was well aware of the value in a secret business of doing openly all that can safely be done with openness.\n\n\nAll of what passed at that interview I do not know, but a part Queen Flavia herself told to me, or rather to Helga, my wife; for although it was meant to reach my ear, yet to me, a man, she would not disclose it directly. First she learnt from Mr. Rassendyll the plans that had been made, and, although she trembled at the danger that he must run in meeting Rupert of Hentzau, she had such love of him and such a trust in his powers that she seemed to doubt little of his success. But she began to reproach herself for having brought him into this peril by writing her letter. At this he took from his pocket the copy that Rischenheim had carried. He had found time to read it, and now before her eyes he kissed it.\n\n\n\u201cHad I as many lives as there are words, my queen,\u201d he said softly, \u201cfor each word I would gladly give a life.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, Rudolf, but you\u2019ve only one life, and that more mine than yours. Did you think we should ever meet again?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d said he; and now they were standing opposite one another.\n\n\n\u201cBut I knew,\u201d she said, her eyes shining brightly; \u201cI knew always that we should meet once more. Not how, nor where, but just that we should. So I lived, Rudolf.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod bless you!\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cYes, I lived through it all.\u201d\n\n\nHe pressed her hand, knowing what that phrase meant and must mean for her.\n\n\n\u201cWill it last forever?\u201d she asked, suddenly gripping his hand tightly. But a moment later she went on: \u201cNo, no, I mustn\u2019t make you unhappy, Rudolf. I\u2019m half glad I wrote the letter, and half glad they stole it. It\u2019s so sweet to have you fighting for me, for me only this time, Rudolf--not for the king, for me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSweet indeed, my dearest lady. Don\u2019t be afraid: we shall win.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou will win, yes. And then you\u2019ll go?\u201d And, dropping his hand, she covered her face with hers.\n\n\n\u201cI mustn\u2019t kiss your face,\u201d said he, \u201cbut your hands I may kiss,\u201d and he kissed her hands as they were pressed against her face.\n\n\n\u201cYou wear my ring,\u201d she murmured through her fingers, \u201calways?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d he said, with a little laugh of wonder at her question.\n\n\n\u201cAnd there is--no one else?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy queen!\u201d said he, laughing again.\n\n\n\u201cNo, I knew really, Rudolf, I knew really,\u201d and now her hands flew out towards him, imploring his pardon. Then she began to speak quickly: \u201cRudolf, last night I had a dream about you, a strange dream. I seemed to be in Strelsau, and all the people were talking about the king. It was you they meant; you were the king. At last you were the king, and I was your queen. But I could see you only very dimly; you were somewhere, but I could not make out where; just sometimes your face came. Then I tried to tell you that you were king--yes, and Colonel Sapt and Fritz tried to tell you; the people, too, called out that you were king. What did it mean? But your face, when I saw it, was unmoved, and very pale, and you seemed not to hear what we said, not even what I said. It almost seemed as if you were dead, and yet king. Ah, you mustn\u2019t die, even to be king,\u201d and she laid a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cSweetheart,\u201d said he gently, \u201cin dreams desires and fears blend in strange visions, so I seemed to you to be both a king and a dead man; but I\u2019m not a king, and I am a very healthy fellow. Yet a thousand thanks to my dearest queen for dreaming of me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, but what could it mean?\u201d she asked again.\n\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean when I dream always of you, except that I always love you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWas it only that?\u201d she said, still unconvinced.\n\n\nWhat more passed between them I do not know. I think that the queen told my wife more, but women will sometimes keep women\u2019s secrets even from their husbands; though they love us, yet we are always in some sort the common enemy, against whom they join hands. Well, I would not look too far into such secrets, for to know must be, I suppose, to blame, and who is himself so blameless that in such a case he would be free with his censures?\n\n\nYet much cannot have passed, for almost close on their talk about the dream came Colonel Sapt, saying that the guards were in line, and all the women streamed out to watch them, while the men followed, lest the gay uniforms should make them forgotten. Certainly a quiet fell over the old castle, that only the constable\u2019s curt tones broke, as he bade Rudolf come by the back way to the stables and mount his horse.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to lose,\u201d said Sapt, and his eye seemed to grudge the queen even one more word with the man she loved.\n\n\nBut Rudolf was not to be hurried into leaving her in such a fashion. He clapped the constable on the shoulder, laughing, and bidding him think of what he would for a moment; then he went again to the queen and would have knelt before her, but that she would not suffer, and they stood with hands locked. Then suddenly she drew him to her and kissed his forehead, saying: \u201cGod go with you, Rudolf my knight.\u201d\n\n\nThus she turned away, letting him go. He walked towards the door; but a sound arrested his steps, and he waited in the middle of the room, his eyes on the door. Old Sapt flew to the threshold, his sword half-way out of its sheath. There was a step coming down the passage, and the feet stopped outside the door.\n\n\n\u201cIs it the king?\u201d whispered Rudolf.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Sapt.\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not the king,\u201d came in unhesitating certainty from Queen Flavia.\n\n\nThey waited: a low knock sounded on the door. Still for a moment they waited. The knock was repeated urgently.\n\n\n\u201cWe must open,\u201d said Sapt. \u201cBehind the curtain with you, Rudolf.\u201d\n\n\nThe queen sat down, and Sapt piled a heap of papers before her, that it might seem as though he and she transacted business. But his precautions were interrupted by a hoarse, eager, low cry from outside, \u201cQuick! in God\u2019s name, quick!\u201d\n\n\nThey knew the voice for Bernenstein\u2019s. The queen sprang up, Rudolf came out, Sapt turned the key. The lieutenant entered, hurried, breathless, pale.\n\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d asked Sapt.\n\n\n\u201cHe has got away?\u201d cried Rudolf, guessing in a moment the misfortune that had brought Bernenstein back.\n\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s got away. Just as we left the town and reached the open road towards Tarlenheim, he said, \u2018Are we going to walk all the way?\u2019 I was not loath to go quicker, and we broke into a trot. But I--ah, what a pestilent fool I am!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNever mind that--go on.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy, I was thinking of him and my task, and having a bullet ready for him, and--\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf everything except your horse?\u201d guessed Sapt, with a grim smile.\n\n\n\u201cYes; and the horse pecked and stumbled, and I fell forward on his neck. I put out my arm to recover myself, and--I jerked my revolver on to the ground.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd he saw?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe saw, curse him. For a second he waited; then he smiled, and turned, and dug his spurs in and was off, straight across country towards Strelsau. Well, I was off my horse in a moment, and I fired three times after him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou hit?\u201d asked Rudolf.\n\n\n\u201cI think so. He shifted the reins from one hand to the other and wrung his arm. I mounted and made after him, but his horse was better than mine and he gained ground. We began to meet people, too, and I didn\u2019t dare to fire again. So I left him and rode here to tell you. Never employ me again, Constable, so long as you live,\u201d and the young man\u2019s face was twisted with misery and shame, as, forgetting the queen\u2019s presence, he sank despondently into a chair.",
    "The king had eaten a little supper, and, having gone to his bedroom, had stretched himself on the bed and fallen asleep without undressing. Herbert was clearing the dining-table and performing similar duties, when suddenly (thus he told it) he found a man standing beside him. He did not know (he was new to the king\u2019s service) who the unexpected visitor was, but he was of middle height, dark, handsome, and \u201clooked a gentleman all over.\u201d He was dressed in a shooting-tunic, and a revolver was thrust through the belt of it. One hand rested on the belt, while the other held a small square box.\n\n\n\u201cTell the king I am here. He expects me,\u201d said the stranger. Herbert, alarmed at the suddenness and silence of the stranger\u2019s approach, and guiltily conscious of having left the door unbolted, drew back. He was unarmed, but, being a stout fellow, was prepared to defend his master as best he could. Rupert--beyond doubt it was Rupert--laughed lightly, saying again, \u201cMan, he expects me. Go and tell him,\u201d and sat himself on the table, swinging his leg. Herbert, influenced by the visitor\u2019s air of command, began to retreat towards the bedroom, keeping his face towards Rupert.\n\n\n\u201cIf the king asks more, tell him I have the packet and the letter,\u201d said Rupert. The man bowed and passed into the bedroom. The king was asleep; when roused he seemed to know nothing of letter or packet, and to expect no visitor. Herbert\u2019s ready fears revived; he whispered that the stranger carried a revolver. Whatever the king\u2019s faults might be--and God forbid that I should speak hardly of him whom fate used so hardly--he was no coward. He sprang from his bed; at the same moment the great boar-hound uncoiled himself and came from beneath, yawning and fawning. But in an instant the beast caught the scent of a stranger: his ears pricked and he gave a low growl, as he looked up in his master\u2019s face. Then Rupert of Hentzau, weary perhaps of waiting, perhaps only doubtful whether his message would be properly delivered, appeared in the doorway.\n\n\nThe king was unarmed, and Herbert in no better plight; their hunting weapons were in the adjoining room, and Rupert seemed to bar the way. I have said that the king was no coward, yet I think, that the sight of Rupert, bringing back the memory of his torments in the dungeon, half cowed him; for he shrank back crying, \u201cYou!\u201d The hound, in subtle understanding of his master\u2019s movement, growled angrily.\n\n\n\u201cYou expected me, sire?\u201d said Rupert with a bow; but he smiled. I know that the sight of the king\u2019s alarm pleased him. To inspire terror was his delight, and it does not come to every man to strike fear into the heart of a king and an Elphberg. It had come more than once to Rupert of Hentzau.\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d muttered the king. Then, recovering his composure a little, he said angrily, \u201cHow dare you come here?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t expect me?\u201d cried Rupert, and in an instant the thought of a trap seemed to flash across his alert mind. He drew the revolver halfway from his belt, probably in a scarcely conscious movement, born of the desire to assure himself of its presence. With a cry of alarm Herbert flung himself before the king, who sank back on the bed. Rupert, puzzled, vexed, yet half-amused (for he smiled still, the man said), took a step forward, crying out something about Rischenheim--what, Herbert could not tell us.\n\n\n\u201cKeep back,\u201d exclaimed the king. \u201cKeep back.\u201d\n\n\nRupert paused; then, as though with a sudden thought, he held up the box that was in his left hand, saying:\n\n\n\u2018\u201cWell, look at this sire, and we\u2019ll talk afterwards,\u201d and he stretched out his hand with the box in it.\n\n\nNow the king stood on a razor\u2019s edge, for the king whispered to Herbert, \u201cWhat is it? Go and take it.\u201d\n\n\nBut Herbert hesitated, fearing to leave the king, whom his body now protected as though with a shield. Rupert\u2019s impatience overcame him: if there were a trap, every moment\u2019s delay doubled his danger. With a scornful laugh he exclaimed, \u201cCatch it, then, if you\u2019re afraid to come for it,\u201d and he flung the packet to Herbert or the king, or which of them might chance to catch it.\n\n\nThis insolence had a strange result. In an instant, with a fierce growl and a mighty bound, Boris was at the stranger\u2019s throat. Rupert had not seen or had not heeded the dog. A startled oath rang out from him. He snatched the revolver from his belt and fired at his assailant. This shot must have broken the beast\u2019s shoulder, but it only half arrested his spring. His great weight was still hurled on Rupert\u2019s chest, and bore him back on his knee. The packet that he had flung lay unheeded. The king, wild with alarm and furious with anger at his favorite\u2019s fate, jumped up and ran past Rupert into the next room. Herbert followed; even as they went Rupert flung the wounded, weakened beast from him and darted to the doorway. He found himself facing Herbert, who held a boar-spear, and the king, who had a double-barreled hunting-gun. He raised his left hand, Herbert said--no doubt he still asked a hearing--but the king leveled his weapon. With a spring Rupert gained the shelter of the door, the bullet sped by him, and buried itself in the wall of the room. Then Herbert was at him with the boar-spear. Explanations must wait now: it was life or death; without hesitation Rupert fired at Herbert, bringing him to the ground with a mortal wound. The king\u2019s gun was at his shoulder again.\n\n\n\u201cYou damned fool!\u201d roared Rupert, \u201cif you must have it, take it,\u201d and gun and revolver rang out at the same moment. But Rupert--never did his nerve fail him--hit, the king missed; Herbert saw the count stand for an instant with his smoking barrel in his hand, looking at the king, who lay on the ground. Then Rupert walked towards the door. I wish I had seen his face then! Did he frown or smile? Was triumph or chagrin uppermost? Remorse? Not he!\n\n\nHe reached the door and passed through. That was the last Herbert saw of him; but the fourth actor in the drama, the wordless player whose part had been so momentous, took the stage. Limping along, now whining in sharp agony, now growling in fierce anger, with blood flowing but hair bristling, the hound Boris dragged himself across the room, through the door, after Rupert of Hentzau. Herbert listened, raising his head from the ground. There was a growl, an oath, the sound of the scuffle. Rupert must have turned in time to receive the dog\u2019s spring. The beast, maimed and crippled by his shattered shoulder, did not reach his enemy\u2019s face, but his teeth tore away the bit of cloth that we had found held in the vise of his jaws. Then came another shot, a laugh, retreating steps, and a door slammed. With that last sound Herbert woke to the fact of the count\u2019s escape; with weary efforts he dragged himself into the passage. The idea that he could go on if he got a drink of brandy turned him in the direction of the cellar. But his strength failed, and he sank down where we found him, not knowing whether the king were dead or still alive, and unable even to make his way back to the room where his master lay stretched on the ground.\n\n\nI had listened to the story, bound as though by a spell. Halfway through, James\u2019s hand had crept to my arm and rested there; when Herbert finished I heard the little man licking his lips, again and again slapping his tongue against them. Then I looked at Sapt. He was as pale as a ghost, and the lines on his face seemed to have grown deeper. He glanced up, and met my regard. Neither of us spoke; we exchanged thoughts with our eyes. \u201cThis is our work,\u201d we said to one another. \u201cIt was our trap, these are our victims.\u201d I cannot even now think of that hour, for by our act the king lay dead.\n\n\nBut was he dead? I seized Sapt by the arm. His glance questioned me.\n\n\n\u201cThe king,\u201d I whispered hoarsely.\n\n\n\u201cYes, the king,\u201d he returned.\n\n\nFacing round, we walked to the door of the dining-room. Here I turned suddenly faint, and clutched at the constable. He held me up, and pushed the door wide open. The smell of powder was in the room; it seemed as if the smoke hung about, curling in dim coils round the chandelier which gave a subdued light. James had the lamp now, and followed us with it. But the king was not there. A sudden hope filled me. He had not been killed then! I regained strength, and darted across towards the inside room. Here too the light was dim, and I turned to beckon for the lamp. Sapt and James came together, and stood peering over my shoulder in the doorway.\n\n\nThe king lay prone on the floor, face downwards, near the bed. He had crawled there, seeking for some place to rest, as we supposed. He did not move. We watched him for a moment; the silence seemed deeper than silence could be. At last, moved by a common impulse, we stepped forward, but timidly, as though we approached the throne of Death himself. I was the first to kneel by the king and raise his head. Blood had flowed from his lips, but it had ceased to flow now. He was dead.\n\n\nI felt Sapt\u2019s hand on my shoulder. Looking up, I saw his other hand stretched out towards the ground. I turned my eyes where he pointed. There, in the king\u2019s hand, stained with the king\u2019s blood, was the box that I had carried to Wintenberg and Rupert of Hentzau had brought to the lodge that night. It was not rest, but the box that the dying king had sought in his last moment. I bent, and lifting his hand unclasped the fingers, still limp and warm.\n\n\nSapt bent down with sudden eagerness. \u201cIs it open?\u201d he whispered.\n\n\nThe string was round it; the sealing-wax was unbroken. The secret had outlived the king, and he had gone to his death unknowing. All at once--I cannot tell why--I put my hand over my eyes; I found my eyelashes were wet.\n\n\n\u201cIs it open?\u201d asked Sapt again, for in the dim light he could not see.\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I answered.\n\n\n\u201cThank God!\u201d said he. And, for Sapt\u2019s, the voice was soft.",
    "From the moment that Mr. Rassendyll thus left my house at midnight on his search for Rupert of Hentzau, every hour and almost every moment brought its incident in the swiftly moving drama which decided the issues of our fortune. What we were doing has been told; by now Rupert himself was on his way back to the city, and the queen was meditating, in her restless vigil, on the resolve that in a few hours was to bring her also to Strelsau. Even in the dead of night both sides were active. For, plan cautiously and skillfully as he might, Rudolf fought with an antagonist who lost no chances, and who had found an apt and useful tool in that same Bauer, a rascal, and a cunning rascal, if ever one were bred in the world. From the beginning even to the end our error lay in taking too little count of this fellow, and dear was the price we paid.\n\n\nBoth to my wife and to Rudolf himself the street had seemed empty of every living being when she watched and he set out. Yet everything had been seen, from his first arrival to the moment when she closed the window after him. At either end of my house there runs out a projection, formed by the bay windows of the principal drawing-room and of the dining room respectively. These projecting walls form shadows, and in the shade of one of them--of which I do not know, nor is it of moment--a man watched all that passed; had he been anywhere else, Rudolf must have seen him. If we had not been too engrossed in playing our own hands, it would doubtless have struck us as probable that Rupert would direct Rischenheim and Bauer to keep an eye on my house during his absence; for it was there that any of us who found our way to the city would naturally resort in the first instance. As a fact, he had not omitted this precaution. The night was so dark that the spy, who had seen the king but once and never Mr. Rassendyll, did not recognize who the visitor was, but he rightly conceived that he should serve his employer by tracking the steps of the tall man who made so mysterious an arrival and so surreptitious a departure from the suspected house. Accordingly, as Rudolf turned the corner and Helena closed the window, a short, thickset figure started cautiously out of the projecting shadow, and followed in Rudolf\u2019s wake through the storm. The pair, tracker and tracked, met nobody, save here and there a police constable keeping a most unwilling beat. Even such were few, and for the most part more intent on sheltering in the lee of a friendly wall and thereby keeping a dry stitch or two on them than on taking note of passers-by. On the pair went. Now Rudolf turned into the Konigstrasse. As he did so, Bauer, who must have been nearly a hundred yards behind (for he could not start till the shutters were closed) quickened his pace and reduced the interval between them to about seventy yards. This he might well have thought a safe distance on a night so wild, when the rush of wind and the pelt of the rain joined to hide the sound of footsteps.\n\n\nBut Bauer reasoned as a townsman, and Rudolf Rassendyll had the quick ear of a man bred in the country and trained to the woodland. All at once there was a jerk of his head; I know so well the motion which marked awakened attention in him. He did not pause nor break his stride: to do either would have been to betray his suspicions to his follower; but he crossed the road to the opposite side to that where No. 19 was situated, and slackened his pace a little, so that there was a longer interval between his own footfalls. The steps behind him grew slower, even as his did; their sound came no nearer: the follower would not overtake. Now, a man who loiters on such a night, just because another ahead of him is fool enough to loiter, has a reason for his action other than what can at first sight be detected. So thought Rudolf Rassendyll, and his brain was busied with finding it out.\n\n\nThen an idea seized him, and, forgetting the precautions that had hitherto served so well, he came to a sudden stop on the pavement, engrossed in deep thought. Was the man who dogged his steps Rupert himself? It would be like Rupert to track him, like Rupert to conceive such an attack, like Rupert to be ready either for a fearless assault from the front or a shameless shot from behind, and indifferent utterly which chance offered, so it threw him one of them. Mr. Rassendyll asked no better than to meet his enemy thus in the open. They could fight a fair fight, and if he fell the lamp would be caught up and carried on by Sapt\u2019s hand or mine; if he got the better of Rupert, the letter would be his; a moment would destroy it and give safety to the queen. I do not suppose that he spent time in thinking how he should escape arrest at the hands of the police whom the fracas would probably rouse; if he did, he may well have reckoned on declaring plainly who he was, of laughing at their surprise over a chance likeness to the king, and of trusting to us to smuggle him beyond the arm of the law. What mattered all that, so that there was a moment in which to destroy the letter? At any rate he turned full round and began to walk straight towards Bauer, his hand resting on the revolver in the pocket of his coat.\n\n\nBauer saw him coming, and must have known that he was suspected or detected. At once the cunning fellow slouched his head between his shoulders, and set out along the street at a quick shuffle, whistling as he went. Rudolf stood still now in the middle of the road, wondering who the man was: whether Rupert, purposely disguising his gait, or a confederate, or, after all, some person innocent of our secret and indifferent to our schemes. On came Bauer, softly, whistling and slushing his feet carelessly through the liquid mud. Now he was nearly opposite where Mr. Rassendyll stood. Rudolf was well-nigh convinced that the man had been on his track: he would make certainty surer. The bold game was always his choice and his delight; this trait he shared with Rupert of Hentzau, and hence arose, I think, the strange secret inclination he had for his unscrupulous opponent. Now he walked suddenly across to Bauer, and spoke to him in his natural voice, at the same time removing the scarf partly, but not altogether, from his face.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re out late, my friend, for a night like this.\u201d\n\n\nBauer, startled though he was by the unexpected challenge, had his wits about him. Whether he identified Rudolf at once, I do not know; I think that he must at least have suspected the truth.\n\n\n\u201cA lad that has no home to go to must needs be out both late and early, sir,\u201d said he, arresting his shuffling steps, and looking up with that honest stolid air which had made a fool of me.\n\n\nI had described him very minutely to Mr. Rassendyll; if Bauer knew or guessed who his challenger was, Mr. Rassendyll was as well equipped for the encounter.\n\n\n\u201cNo home to go to!\u201d cried Rudolf in a pitying tone. \u201cHow\u2019s that? But anyhow, Heaven forbid that you or any man should walk the streets a night like this. Come, I\u2019ll give you a bed. Come with me, and I\u2019ll find you good shelter, my boy.\u201d\n\n\nBauer shrank away. He did not see the meaning of this stroke, and his eye, traveling up the street, showed that his thoughts had turned towards flight. Rudolf gave no time for putting any such notion into effect. Maintaining his air of genial compassion, he passed his left arm through Bauer\u2019s right, saying:\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian man, and a bed you shall have this night, my lad, as sure as I\u2019m alive. Come along with me. The devil, it\u2019s not weather for standing still!\u201d\n\n\nThe carrying of arms in Strelsau was forbidden. Bauer had no wish to get into trouble with the police, and, moreover, he had intended nothing but a reconnaissance; he was therefore without any weapon, and he was a child in Rudolf\u2019s grasp. He had no alternative but to obey the suasion of Mr. Rassendyll\u2019s arm, and they two began to walk down the Konigstrasse. Bauer\u2019s whistle had died away, not to return; but from time to time Rudolf hummed softly a cheerful tune, his fingers beating time on Bauer\u2019s captive arm. Presently they crossed the road. Bauer\u2019s lagging steps indicated that he took no pleasure in the change of side, but he could not resist.\n\n\n\u201cAy, you shall go where I am going, my lad,\u201d said Rudolf encouragingly; and he laughed a little as he looked down at the fellow\u2019s face.\n\n\nAlong they went; soon they came to the small numbers at the station end of the Konigstrasse. Rudolf began to peer up at the shop fronts.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cursed dark,\u201d said he. \u201cPray, lad, can you make out which is nineteen?\u201d\n\n\nThe moment he had spoken the smile broadened on his face. The shot had gone home. Bauer was a clever scoundrel, but his nerves were not under perfect control, and his arm had quivered under Rudolf\u2019s.\n\n\n\u201cNineteen, sir?\u201d he stammered.\n\n\n\u201cAy, nineteen. That\u2019s where we\u2019re bound for, you and I. There I hope we shall find--what we want.\u201d\n\n\nBauer seemed bewildered: no doubt he was at a loss how either to understand or to parry the bold attack.\n\n\n\u201cAh, this looks like it,\u201d said Rudolf, in a tone of great satisfaction, as they came to old Mother Holf\u2019s little shop. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a one and a nine over the door, my lad? Ah, and Holf! Yes, that\u2019s the name. Pray ring the bell. My hands are occupied.\u201d\n\n\nRudolf\u2019s hands were indeed occupied; one held Bauer\u2019s arm, now no longer with a friendly pressure, but with a grip of iron; in the other the captive saw the revolver that had till now lain hidden.\n\n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d asked Rudolf pleasantly. \u201cYou must ring for me, mustn\u2019t you? It would startle them if I roused them with a shot.\u201d A motion of the barrel told Bauer the direction which the shot would take.\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no bell,\u201d said Bauer sullenly.\n\n\n\u201cAh, then you knock?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn any particular way, my friend?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d growled Bauer.\n\n\n\u201cNor I. Can\u2019t you guess?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, I know nothing of it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, we must try. You knock, and--Listen, my lad. You must guess right. You understand?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHow can I guess?\u201d asked Bauer, in an attempt at bluster.\n\n\n\u201cIndeed, I don\u2019t know,\u201d smiled Rudolf. \u201cBut I hate waiting, and if the door is not open in two minutes, I shall arouse the good folk with a shot. You see? You quite see, don\u2019t you?\u201d Again the barrel\u2019s motion pointed and explained Mr. Rassendyll\u2019s meaning.\n\n\nUnder this powerful persuasion Bauer yielded. He lifted his hand and knocked on the door with his knuckles, first loudly, then very softly, the gentler stroke being repeated five times in rapid succession. Clearly he was expected, for without any sound of approaching feet the chain was unfastened with a subdued rattle. Then came the noise of the bolt being cautiously worked back into its socket. As it shot home a chink of the door opened. At the same moment Rudolf\u2019s hand slipped from Bauer\u2019s arm. With a swift movement he caught the fellow by the nape of the neck and flung him violently forward into the roadway, where, losing his footing, he fell sprawling face downwards in the mud. Rudolf threw himself against the door: it yielded, he was inside, and in an instant he had shut the door and driven the bolt home again, leaving Bauer in the gutter outside. Then he turned, with his hand on the butt of his revolver. I know that he hoped to find Rupert of Hentzau\u2019s face within a foot of his.",
    "Resistance was the one thing worse than to yield. Wit, and not force, must find escape this time. Rudolf stopped, looking round again with a surprised air. Then he drew himself up with an assumption of dignity, and waited for the constable. If that last card must be played, he would win the hand with it.\n\n\u201cWell, what do you want?\u201d he asked coldly, when the man was a few yards from him; and, as he spoke, he withdrew the scarf almost entirely from his features, keeping it only over his chin. \u201cYou call very peremptorily,\u201d he continued, staring contemptuously. \u201cWhat\u2019s your business with me?\u201d\n\nWith a violent start, the sergeant--for such the star on his collar and the lace on his cuff proclaimed him--leant forward in the saddle to look at the man whom he had hailed. Rudolf said nothing and did not move. The man\u2019s eyes studied his face intently. Then he sat bolt upright and saluted, his face dyed to a deep red in his sudden confusion.\n\n\u201cAnd why do you salute me now?\u201d asked Rudolf in a mocking tone. \u201cFirst you hunt me, then you salute me. By Heaven, I don\u2019t know why you put yourself out at all about me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI--I--\u201d the fellow stuttered. Then trying a fresh start, he stammered, \u201cYour Majesty, I didn\u2019t know--I didn\u2019t suppose--\u201d\n\nRudolf stepped towards him with a quick, decisive tread.\n\n\u201cAnd why do you call me \u2018Your Majesty\u2019?\u201d he asked, still mockingly.\n\n\u201cIt--it--isn\u2019t it your Majesty?\u201d\n\nRudolf was close by him now, his hand on the horse\u2019s neck.\n\nHe looked up into the sergeant\u2019s face with steady eyes, saying:\n\n\u201cYou make a mistake, my friend. I am not the king.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not--?\u201d stuttered the bewildered fellow.\n\n\u201cBy no means. And, sergeant--?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, you mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cA zealous officer, sergeant, can make no greater mistake than to take for the king a gentleman who is not the king. It might injure his prospects, since the king, not being here, mightn\u2019t wish to have it supposed that he was here. Do you follow me, sergeant?\u201d\n\nThe man said nothing, but stared hard. After a moment Rudolf continued:\n\n\u201cIn such a case,\u201d said he, \u201ca discreet officer would not trouble the gentleman any more, and would be very careful not to mention that he had made such a silly mistake. Indeed, if questioned, he would answer without hesitation that he hadn\u2019t seen anybody even like the king, much less the king himself.\u201d\n\nA doubtful, puzzled little smile spread under the sergeant\u2019s moustache.\n\n\u201cYou see, the king is not even in Strelsau,\u201d said Rudolf.\n\n\u201cNot in Strelsau, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, no, he\u2019s at Zenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! At Zenda, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. It is therefore impossible--physically impossible--that he should be here.\u201d\n\nThe fellow was convinced that he understood now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly impossible, sir,\u201d said he, smiling more broadly.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. And therefore impossible also that you should have seen him.\u201d With this Rudolf took a gold piece from his pocket and handed it to the sergeant. The fellow took it with something like a wink.\n\n\u201cAs for you, you\u2019ve searched here and found nobody,\u201d concluded Mr. Rassendyll. \u201cSo hadn\u2019t you better at once search somewhere else?\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, sir,\u201d said the sergeant, and with the most deferential salute, and another confidential smile, he turned and rode back by the way he had come. No doubt he wished that he could meet a gentleman who was--not the king--every morning of his life. It hardly need be said that all idea of connecting the gentleman with the crime committed in the Konigstrasse had vanished from his mind. Thus Rudolf won freedom from the man\u2019s interference, but at a dangerous cost--how dangerous he did not know. It was indeed most impossible that the king could be in Strelsau.\n\n\nHe lost no time now in turning his steps towards his refuge. It was past five o\u2019clock, day came quickly, and the streets began to be peopled by men and women on their way to open stalls or to buy in the market. Rudolf crossed the square at a rapid walk, for he was afraid of the soldiers who were gathering for early duty opposite to the barracks. Fortunately he passed by them unobserved, and gained the comparative seclusion of the street in which my house stands, without encountering any further difficulties. In truth, he was almost in safety; but bad luck was now to have its turn. When Mr. Rassendyll was no more than fifty yards from my door, a carriage suddenly drove up and stopped a few paces in front of him. The footman sprang down and opened the door. Two ladies got out; they were dressed in evening costume, and were returning from a ball. One was middle-aged, the other young and rather pretty. They stood for a moment on the pavement, the younger saying:\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it pleasant, mother? I wish I could always be up at five o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear, you wouldn\u2019t like it for long,\u201d answered the elder. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice for a change, but--\u201d\n\nShe stopped abruptly. Her eye had fallen on Rudolf Rassendyll. He knew her: she was no less a person than the wife of Helsing the chancellor; his was the house at which the carriage had stopped. The trick that had served with the sergeant of police would not do now. She knew the king too well to believe that she could be mistaken about him; she was too much of a busybody to be content to pretend that she was mistaken.\n\n\u201cGood gracious!\u201d she whispered loudly, and, catching her daughter\u2019s arm, she murmured, \u201cHeavens, my dear, it\u2019s the king!\u201d\n\n\nRudolf was caught. Not only the ladies, but their servants were looking at him. Flight was impossible. He walked by them. The ladies curtseyed, the servants bowed bare-headed. Rudolf touched his hat and bowed slightly in return. He walked straight on towards my house; they were watching him, and he knew it. Most heartily did he curse the untimely hours to which folks keep up their dancing, but he thought that a visit to my house would afford as plausible an excuse for his presence as any other. So he went on, surveyed by the wondering ladies, and by the servants who, smothering smiles, asked one another what brought his Majesty abroad in such a plight (for Rudolf\u2019s clothes were soaked and his boots muddy), at such an hour--and that in Strelsau, when all the world thought he was at Zenda.\n\n\nRudolf reached my house. Knowing that he was watched he had abandoned all intention of giving the signal agreed on between my wife and himself and of making his way in through the window. Such a sight would indeed have given the excellent Baroness von Helsing matter for gossip! It was better to let every servant in my house see his open entrance. But, alas, virtue itself sometimes leads to ruin. My dearest Helga, sleepless and watchful in the interest of her mistress, was even now behind the shutter, listening with all her ears and peering through the chinks. No sooner did Rudolf\u2019s footsteps become audible than she cautiously unfastened the shutter, opened the window, put her pretty head out, and called softly: \u201cAll\u2019s safe! Come in!\u201d\n\nThe mischief was done then, for the faces of Helsing\u2019s wife and daughter, ay, and the faces of Helsing\u2019s servants, were intent on this most strange spectacle. Rudolf, turning his head over his shoulder, saw them; a moment later poor Helga saw them also. Innocent and untrained in controlling her feelings, she gave a shrill little cry of dismay, and hastily drew back. Rudolf looked round again. The ladies had retreated to the cover of the porch, but he still saw their eager faces peering from between the pillars that supported it.\n\n\u201cI may as well go in now,\u201d said Rudolf, and in he sprang. There was a merry smile on his face as he ran forward to meet Helga, who leant against the table, pale and agitated.\n\n\u201cThey saw you?\u201d she gasped.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d said he. Then his sense of amusement conquered everything else, and he sat down in a chair, laughing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give my life,\u201d said he, \u201cto hear the story that the chancellor will be waked up to hear in a minute or two from now!\u201d",
    "In her entire preoccupation with Mr. Rassendyll, she gave little thought to what might have happened at the hunting lodge; but Bernenstein drew gloomy auguries from the failure of Sapt and myself to return at the proper time. Either evil had befallen us, or the letter had reached the king before we arrived at the lodge; the probabilities seemed to him to be confined to these alternatives. Yet when he spoke in this strain to the queen, he could get from her nothing except, \u201cIf we can find Mr. Rassendyll, he will tell us what to do.\u201d\n\nThus, then, a little after nine in the morning the queen\u2019s carriage drove up to my door. The ladies of the chancellor\u2019s family had enjoyed a very short night\u2019s rest, for their heads came bobbing out of window the moment the wheels were heard; many people were about now, and the crown on the panels attracted the usual small crowd of loiterers. Bernenstein sprang out and gave his hand to the queen. With a hasty slight bow to the onlookers, she hastened up the two or three steps of the porch, and with her own hand rang the bell. Inside, the carriage had just been observed. My wife\u2019s waiting-maid ran hastily to her mistress; Helga was lying on her bed; she rose at once, and after a few moments of necessary preparations (or such preparations as seem to ladies necessary, however great the need of haste may be) hurried downstairs to receive her Majesty--and to warn her Majesty. She was too late. The door was already open. The butler and the footman both had run to it, and thrown it open for the queen. As Helga reached the foot of the stairs, her Majesty was just entering the room where Rudolf was, the servants attending her, and Bernenstein standing behind, his helmet in his hand.\n\n\nRudolf and the chancellor had been continuing their conversation. To avoid the observations of passers-by (for the interior of the room is easy to see from the street), the blind had been drawn down, and the room was in deep shadow. They had heard the wheels, but neither of them dreamt that the visitor could be the queen. It was an utter surprise to them when, without their orders, the door was suddenly flung open. The chancellor, slow of movement, and not, if I may say it, over-quick of brain, sat in his corner for half a minute or more before he rose to his feet. On the other hand, Rudolf Rassendyll was the best part of the way across the room in an instant. Helga was at the door now, and she thrust her head round young Bernenstein\u2019s broad shoulders. Thus she saw what happened. The queen, forgetting the servants, and not observing Helsing--seeming indeed to stay for nothing, and to think of nothing, but to have her thoughts and heart filled with the sight of the man she loved and the knowledge of his safety--met him as he ran towards her, and, before Helga, or Bernenstein, or Rudolf himself, could stay her or conceive what she was about to do, caught both his hands in hers with an intense grasp, crying:\n\n\u201cRudolf, you\u2019re safe! Thank God, oh, thank God!\u201d and she carried his hands to her lips and kissed them passionately.\n\n\nA moment of absolute silence followed, dictated in the servants by decorum, in the chancellor by consideration, in Helga and Bernenstein by utter consternation. Rudolf himself also was silent, but whether from bewilderment or an emotion answering to hers, I know not. Either it might well be. The stillness struck her. She looked up in his eyes; she looked round the room and saw Helsing, now bowing profoundly from the corner; she turned her head with a sudden frightened jerk, and glanced at my motionless deferential servants. Then it came upon her what she had done. She gave a quick gasp for breath, and her face, always pale, went white as marble. Her features set in a strange stiffness, and suddenly she reeled where she stood, and fell forward. Only Rudolf\u2019s hand bore her up. Thus for a moment, too short to reckon, they stood. Then he, a smile of great love and pity coming on his lips, drew her to him, and passing his arm about her waist, thus supported her. Then, smiling still, he looked down on her, and said in a low tone, yet distinct enough for all to hear:\n\n\u201cAll is well, dearest.\u201d\n\n\nMy wife gripped Bernenstein\u2019s arm, and he turned to find her pale-faced too, with quivering lips and shining eyes. But the eyes had a message, and an urgent one, for him. He read it; he knew that it bade him second what Rudolf Rassendyll had done. He came forward and approached Rudolf; then he fell on one knee, and kissed Rudolf\u2019s left hand that was extended to him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very glad to see you, Lieutenant von Bernenstein,\u201d said Rudolf Rassendyll.\n\n\nFor a moment the thing was done, ruin averted, and safety secured. Everything had been at stake; that there was such a man as Rudolf Rassendyll might have been disclosed; that he had once filled the king\u2019s throne was a high secret which they were prepared to trust to Helsing under stress of necessity; but there remained something which must be hidden at all costs, and which the queen\u2019s passionate exclamation had threatened to expose. There was a Rudolf Rassendyll, and he had been king; but, more than all this, the queen loved him and he the queen. That could be told to none, not even to Helsing; for Helsing, though he would not gossip to the town, would yet hold himself bound to carry the matter to the king. So Rudolf chose to take any future difficulties rather than that present and certain disaster. Sooner than entail it on her he loved, he claimed for himself the place of her husband and the name of king. And she, clutching at the only chance that her act left, was content to have it so. It may be that for an instant her weary, tortured brain found sweet rest in the dim dream that so it was, for she let her head lie there on his breast and her eyes closed, her face looking very peaceful, and a soft little sigh escaping in pleasure from her lips.\n\n\nBut every moment bore its peril and exacted its effort. Rudolf led the queen to a couch, and then briefly charged the servants not to speak of his presence for a few hours. As they had no doubt perceived, said he, from the queen\u2019s agitation, important business was on foot; it demanded his presence in Strelsau, but required also that his presence should not be known. A short time would free them from the obligation which he now asked of their loyalty. When they had withdrawn, bowing obedience, he turned to Helsing, pressed his hand warmly, reiterated his request for silence, and said that he would summon the chancellor to his presence again later in the day, either where he was or at the palace. Then he bade all withdraw and leave him alone for a little with the queen. He was obeyed; but Helsing had hardly left the house when Rudolf called Bernenstein back, and with him my wife. Helga hastened to the queen, who was still sorely agitated; Rudolf drew Bernenstein aside, and exchanged with him all their news. Mr. Rassendyll was much disturbed at finding that no tidings had come from Colonel Sapt and myself, but his apprehension was greatly increased on learning the untoward accident by which the king himself had been at the lodge the night before. Indeed, he was utterly in the dark; where the king was, where Rupert, where we were, he did not know. And he was here in Strelsau, known as the king to half a dozen people or more, protected only by their promises, liable at any moment to be exposed by the coming of the king himself, or even by a message from him.",
    "The girl followed Rupert up the narrow crazy staircase of the tall old house. They passed three floors, all uninhabited; a last steep flight that brought them right under the deep arched roof. Rupert opened a door that stood at the top of the stairs, and, followed still by Rosa with her mysterious happy smile, entered a long narrow room. The ceiling, high in the centre, sloped rapidly down on either side, so that at door and window it was little more than six feet above the floor. There was an oak table and a few chairs; a couple of iron bedsteads stood by the wall near the window. One was empty; the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim lay on the other, fully dressed, his right arm supported in a sling of black silk. Rupert paused on the threshold, smiling at his cousin; the girl passed on to a high press or cupboard, and, opening it, took out plates, glasses, and the other furniture of the table. Rischenheim sprang up and ran across the room.\n\n\u201cWhat news?\u201d he cried eagerly. \u201cYou escaped them, Rupert?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt appears so,\u201d said Rupert airily; and, advancing into the room, he threw himself into a chair, tossing his hat on to the table.\n\n\u201cIt appears that I escaped, although some fool\u2019s stupidity nearly made an end of me.\u201d Rischenheim flushed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you about that directly,\u201d he said, glancing at the girl who had put some cold meat and a bottle of wine on the table, and was now completing the preparations for Rupert\u2019s meal in a very leisurely fashion.\n\n\u201cHad I nothing to do but to look at pretty faces--which, by Heaven, I wish heartily were the case--I would beg you to stay,\u201d said Rupert, rising and making her a profound bow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no wish to hear what doesn\u2019t concern me,\u201d she retorted scornfully.\n\n\u201cWhat a rare and blessed disposition!\u201d said he, holding the door for her and bowing again.\n\n\u201cI know what I know,\u201d she cried to him triumphantly from the landing. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d give something to know it too, Count Rupert!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely, for, by Heaven, girls know wonderful things!\u201d smiled Rupert; but he shut the door and came quickly back to the table, now frowning again. \u201cCome, tell me, how did they make a fool of you, or why did you make a fool of me, cousin?\u201d\n\n\nWhile Rischenheim related how he had been trapped and tricked at the Castle of Zenda, Rupert of Hentzau made a very good breakfast. He offered no interruption and no comments, but when Rudolf Rassendyll came into the story he looked up for an instant with a quick jerk of his head and a sudden light in his eyes. The end of Rischenheim\u2019s narrative found him tolerant and smiling again.\n\n\u201cAh, well, the snare was cleverly set,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t wonder you fell into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now you? What happened to you?\u201d asked Rischenheim eagerly.\n\n\u201cI? Why, having your message which was not your message, I obeyed your directions which were not your directions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou went to the lodge?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you found Sapt there?--Anybody else?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, not Sapt at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Sapt? But surely they laid a trap for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery possibly, but the jaws didn\u2019t bite.\u201d Rupert crossed his legs and lit a cigarette.\n\n\u201cBut what did you find?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? I found the king\u2019s forester, and the king\u2019s boar-hound, and--well, I found the king himself, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe king at the lodge?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t so wrong as you thought, were you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut surely Sapt, or Bernenstein, or some one was with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I tell you, his forester and his boar-hound. No other man or beast, on my honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you gave him the letter?\u201d cried Rischenheim, trembling with excitement.\n\n\u201cAlas, no, my dear cousin. I threw the box at him, but I don\u2019t think he had time to open it. We didn\u2019t get to that stage of the conversation at which I had intended to produce the letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why not--why not?\u201d\n\n\nRupert rose to his feet, and, coming just opposite to where Rischenheim sat, balanced himself on his heels, and looked down at his cousin, blowing the ash from his cigarette and smiling pleasantly.\n\n\u201cHave you noticed,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat my coat\u2019s torn?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. The boar-hound tried to bite me, cousin. And the forester would have stabbed me. And--well, the king wanted to shoot me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes! For God\u2019s sake, what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they none of them did what they wanted. That\u2019s what happened, dear cousin.\u201d\n\nRischenheim was staring at him now with wide-opened eyes. Rupert smiled down on him composedly.\n\n\u201cBecause, you see,\u201d he added, \u201cHeaven helped me. So that, my dear cousin, the dog will bite no more, and the forester will stab no more. Surely the country is well rid of them?\u201d\n\n\nA silence followed. Then Rischenheim, leaning forward, said in a low whisper, as though afraid to hear his own question:\n\n\u201cAnd the king?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe king? Well, the king will shoot no more.\u201d\n\nFor a moment Rischenheim, still leaning forward, gazed at his cousin. Then he sank slowly back into his chair.\n\n\u201cMy God!\u201d he murmured: \u201cmy God!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe king was a fool,\u201d said Rupert. \u201cCome, I\u2019ll tell you a little more about it.\u201d He drew a chair up and seated himself in it.\n\n\nWhile he talked Rischenheim seemed hardly to listen. The story gained in effect from the contrast of Rupert\u2019s airy telling; his companion\u2019s pale face and twitching hands tickled his fancy to more shameless jesting. But when he had finished, he gave a pull to his small smartly-curled moustache and said with a sudden gravity:\n\n\u201cAfter all, though, it\u2019s a serious matter.\u201d\n\n\nRischenheim was appalled at the issue. His cousin\u2019s influence had been strong enough to lead him into the affair of the letter; he was aghast to think how Rupert\u2019s reckless dare-deviltry had led on from stage to stage till the death of a king seemed but an incident in his schemes. He sprang suddenly to his feet, crying:\n\n\u201cBut we must fly--we must fly!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, we needn\u2019t fly. Perhaps we\u2019d better go, but we needn\u2019t fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut when it becomes known?\u201d He broke off and then cried: \u201cWhy did you tell me? Why did you come back here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I told you because it was interesting, and I came back here because I had no money to go elsewhere.\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy not call me king?\u201d asked Rudolf.\n\u201cThey call you that in Strelsau?\u201d\n\u201cThose that know I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they are--?\u201d\n\u201cSome few score.\u201d\n\u201cAnd thus,\u201d said Rupert, waving an arm towards the window, \u201cthe town is quiet and the flags fly?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting to see them lowered?\u201d\n\u201cA man likes to have some notice taken of what he has done,\u201d Rupert complained. \u201cHowever, I can get them lowered when I will.\u201d\n\u201cBy telling your news? Would that be good for yourself?\u201d\n\u201cForgive me--not that way. Since the king has two lives, it is but in nature that he should have two deaths.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when he has undergone the second?\u201d\n\u201cI shall live at peace, my friend, on a certain source of income that I possess.\u201d He tapped his breast-pocket with a slight, defiant laugh. \u201cIn these days,\u201d said he, \u201ceven queens must be careful about their letters. We live in moral times.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t share the responsibility for it,\u201d said Rudolf, smiling.\n\u201cI make my little protest. But what\u2019s your business, play-actor? For I think you\u2019re rather tiresome.\u201d\n\nRudolf grew grave. He advanced towards the table, and spoke in low, serious tones.\n\u201cMy lord, you\u2019re alone in this matter now. Rischenheim is a prisoner; your rogue Bauer I encountered last night and broke his head.\u201d\n\u201cAh, you did?\u201d\n\u201cYou have what you know of in your hands. If you yield, on my honor I will save your life.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t desire my blood, then, most forgiving play-actor?\u201d\n\u201cSo much, that I daren\u2019t fail to offer you life,\u201d answered Rudolf Rassendyll. \u201cCome, sir, your plan has failed: give up the letter.\u201d\n\nRupert looked at him thoughtfully.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see me safe off if I give it you?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI\u2019ll prevent your death. Yes, and I\u2019ll see you safe.\u201d\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d\n\u201cTo a fortress, where a trustworthy gentleman will guard you.\u201d\n\u201cFor how long, my dear friend?\u201d\n\u201cI hope for many years, my dear Count.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact, I suppose, as long as--?\u201d\n\u201cHeaven leaves you to the world, Count. It\u2019s impossible to set you free.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the offer, then?\u201d\n\u201cThe extreme limit of indulgence,\u201d answered Rudolf. \n\nRupert burst into a laugh, half of defiance, yet touched with the ring of true amusement. Then he lit a cigarette and sat puffing and smiling.\n\u201cI should wrong you by straining your kindness so far,\u201d said he; and in wanton insolence, seeking again to show Mr. Rassendyll the mean esteem in which he held him, and the weariness his presence was, he raised his arms and stretched them above his head, as a man does in the fatigue of tedium. \u201cHeigho!\u201d he yawned.\n\nBut he had overshot the mark this time. With a sudden swift bound Rudolf was upon him; his hands gripped Rupert\u2019s wrists, and with his greater strength he bent back the count\u2019s pliant body till trunk and head lay flat on the table. Neither man spoke; their eyes met; each heard the other\u2019s breathing and felt the vapor of it on his face. The girl outside had seen the movement of Rudolf\u2019s figure, but her cranny did not serve her to show her the two where they were now; she knelt on her knees in ignorant suspense. Slowly and with a patient force Rudolf began to work his enemy\u2019s arms towards one another. Rupert had read his design in his eyes and resisted with tense muscles. It seemed as though his arms must crack; but at last they moved. Inch by inch they were driven closer; now the elbows almost touched; now the wrists joined in reluctant contact. The sweat broke out on the count\u2019s brow, and stood in large drops on Rudolf\u2019s. Now the wrists were side by side, and slowly the long sinewy fingers of Rudolf\u2019s right hand, that held one wrist already in their vise, began to creep round the other. The grip seemed to have half numbed Rupert\u2019s arms, and his struggles grew fainter. Round both wrists the sinewy fingers climbed and coiled; gradually and timidly the grasp of the other hand was relaxed and withdrawn. Would the one hold both? With a great spasm of effort Rupert put it to the proof.\n\nThe smile that bent Mr. Rassendyll\u2019s lips gave the answer. He could hold both, with one hand he could hold both: not for long, no, but for an instant. And then, in the instant, his left hand, free at last, shot to the breast of the count\u2019s coat. It was the same that he had worn at the hunting-lodge, and was ragged and torn from the boar-hound\u2019s teeth. Rudolf tore it further open, and his hand dashed in.\n\u201cGod\u2019s curse on you!\u201d snarled Rupert of Hentzau.\n\nBut Mr. Rassendyll still smiled. Then he drew out a letter. A glance at it showed him the queen\u2019s seal. As he glanced Rupert made another effort. The one hand, wearied out, gave way, and Mr. Rassendyll had no more than time to spring away, holding his prize. The next moment he had his revolver in his hand--none too soon, for Rupert of Hentzau\u2019s barrel faced him, and they stood thus, opposite to one another, with no more than three or four feet between the mouths of their weapons.",
    "With an angry muttered oath Rupert flung his revolver on the table.\nRudolf came forward and laid his by it. Then he took up both, and, crossing to the mantelpiece, laid them there; between there he placed the queen\u2019s letter. A bright blaze burnt in the grate; it needed but the slightest motion of his hand to set the letter beyond all danger. But he placed it carefully on the mantelpiece, and, with a slight smile on his face, turned to Rupert, saying: \u201cNow shall we resume the bout that Fritz von Tarlenheim interrupted in the forest of Zenda?\u201d\n\nAll this while they had been speaking in subdued accents, resolution in one, anger in the other, keeping the voice in an even, deliberate lowness. The girl outside caught only a word here and there; but now suddenly the flash of steel gleamed on her eyes through the crevice of the hinge. She gave a sudden gasp, and, pressing her face closer to the opening, listened and looked. For Rupert of Hentzau had taken the swords from their case and put them on the table. With a slight bow Rudolf took one, and the two assumed their positions. Suddenly Rupert lowered his point. The frown vanished from his face, and he spoke in his usual bantering tone.\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d said he, \u201cperhaps we\u2019re letting our feelings run away with us. Have you more of a mind now to be King of Ruritania? If so, I\u2019m ready to be the most faithful of your subjects.\u201d\n\u201cYou honor me, Count.\u201d\n\u201cProvided, of course, that I\u2019m one of the most favored and the richest. Come, come, the fool is dead now; he lived like a fool and he died like a fool. The place is empty. A dead man has no rights and suffers no wrongs. Damn it, that\u2019s good law, isn\u2019t it? Take his place and his wife. You can pay my price then. Or are you still so virtuous? Faith, how little some men learn from the world they live in! If I had your chance!\u201d\n\u201cCome, Count, you\u2019d be the last man to trust Rupert of Hentzau.\u201d\n\u201cIf I made it worth his while?\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019s a man who would take the pay and betray his associate.\u201d\n\nAgain Rupert flushed. When he next spoke his voice was hard, cold, and low.\n\u201cBy God, Rudolf Rassendyll,\u201d said he, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you here and now.\u201d\n\u201cI ask no better than that you should try.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then I\u2019ll proclaim that woman for what she is in all Strelsau.\u201d A smile came on his lips as he watched Rudolf\u2019s face.\n\u201cGuard yourself, my lord,\u201d said Mr. Rassendyll.\n\u201cAy, for no better than--There, man, I\u2019m ready for you.\u201d For Rudolf\u2019s blade had touched his in warning.\n\nThe steel jangled. The girl\u2019s pale face was at the crevice of the hinge. She heard the blades cross again and again. Then one would run up the other with a sharp, grating slither. At times she caught a glimpse of a figure in quick forward lunge or rapid wary withdrawal. Her brain was almost paralyzed.\n\nIgnorant of the mind and heart of young Rupert, she could not conceive that he tried to kill the king. Yet the words she had caught sounded like the words of men quarreling, and she could not persuade herself that the gentlemen fenced only for pastime. They were not speaking now; but she heard their hard breathing and the movement of their unresting feet on the bare boards of the floor. Then a cry rang out, clear and merry with the fierce hope of triumph: \u201cNearly! nearly!\u201d\n\nShe knew the voice for Rupert of Hentzau\u2019s, and it was the king who answered calmly, \u201cNearly isn\u2019t quite.\u201d\n\nAgain she listened. They seemed to have paused for a moment, for there was no sound, save of the hard breathing and deep-drawn pants of men who rest an instant in the midst of intense exertion. Then came again the clash and the slitherings; and one of them crossed into her view. She knew the tall figure and she saw the red hair: it was the king. Backward step by step he seemed to be driven, coming nearer and nearer to the door. At last there was no more than a foot between him and her; only the crazy panel prevented her putting out her hand to touch him. Again the voice of Rupert rang out in rich exultation, \u201cI have you now! Say your prayers, King Rudolf!\u201d",
    "\u201cAre you, too, against me, my queen?\u201d he murmured caressing her ruddy hair.\n\nWe were half mad that night, Sapt and Bernenstein and I. The thing seemed to have got into our blood and to have become part of ourselves. For us it was inevitable--nay, it was done. Sapt busied himself in preparing the account of the fire at the hunting-lodge; it was to be communicated to the journals, and it told with much circumstantiality how Rudolf Rassendyll had come to visit the king, with James his servant, and, the king being summoned unexpectedly to the capital, had been awaiting his Majesty\u2019s return when he met his fate. There was a short history of Rudolf, a glancing reference to his family, a dignified expression of condolence with his relatives, to whom the king was sending messages of deepest regret by the hands of Mr. Rassendyll\u2019s servant. At another table young Bernenstein was drawing up, under the constable\u2019s direction, a narrative of Rupert of Hentzau\u2019s attempt on the king\u2019s life and the king\u2019s courage in defending himself. The count, eager to return (so it ran), had persuaded the king to meet him by declaring that he held a state-document of great importance and of a most secret nature; the king, with his habitual fearlessness, had gone alone, but only to refuse with scorn Count Rupert\u2019s terms. Enraged at this unfavorable reception, the audacious criminal had made a sudden attack on the king, with what issue all knew. He had met his own death, while the king, perceiving from a glance at the document that it compromised well-known persons, had, with the nobility which marked him, destroyed it unread before the eyes of those who were rushing in to his rescue. I supplied suggestions and improvements; and, engrossed in contriving how to blind curious eyes, we forgot the real and permanent difficulties of the thing we had resolved upon. For us they did not exist; Sapt met every objection by declaring that the thing had been done once and could be done again. Bernenstein and I were not behind him in confidence.\n\nWe would guard the secret with brain and hand and life, even as we had guarded and kept the secret of the queen\u2019s letter, which would now go with Rupert of Hentzau to his grave. Bauer we could catch and silence: nay, who would listen to such a tale from such a man? Rischenheim was ours; the old woman would keep her doubts between her teeth for her own sake. To his own land and his own people Rudolf must be dead while the King of Ruritania would stand before all Europe recognized, unquestioned, unassailed. True, he must marry the queen again; Sapt was ready with the means, and would hear nothing of the difficulty and risk in finding a hand to perform the necessary ceremony. If we quailed in our courage: we had but to look at the alternative, and find recompense for the perils of what we meant to undertake by a consideration of the desperate risk involved in abandoning it. Persuaded that the substitution of Rudolf for the king was the only thing that would serve our turn, we asked no longer whether it was possible, but sought only the means to make it safe.\n\nBut Rudolf himself had not spoken. Sapt\u2019s appeal and the queen\u2019s imploring cry had shaken but not overcome him; he had wavered, but he was not won. Yet there was no talk of impossibility or peril in his mouth, any more than in ours: those were not what gave him pause. The score on which he hesitated was whether the thing should be done, not whether it could; our appeals were not to brace a failing courage, but cajole a sturdy sense of honor which found the imposture distasteful so soon as it seemed to serve a personal end. To serve the king he had played the king in old days, but he did not love to play the king when the profit of it was to be his own. Hence he was unmoved till his care for the fair fame of the queen and the love of his friends joined to buffet his resolution.\n\nThen he faltered; but he had not fallen. Yet Colonel Sapt did all as though he had given his assent, and watched the last hours in which his flight from Strelsau was possible go quickly by with more than equanimity. Why hurry Rudolf\u2019s resolve? Every moment shut him closer in the trap of an inevitable choice. With every hour that he was called the king, it became more impossible for him to bear any other name all his days. Therefore Sapt let Mr. Rassendyll doubt and struggle, while he himself wrote his story and laid his long-headed plans. And now and then James, the little servant, came in and went out, sedate and smug, but with a quiet satisfaction gleaming in his eyes. He had made a story for a pastime, and it was being translated into history. He at least would bear his part in it unflinchingly.\n\nBefore now the queen had left us, persuaded to lie down and try to rest till the matter should be settled. Stilled by Rudolf\u2019s gentle rebuke, she had urged him no more in words, but there was an entreaty in her eyes stronger than any spoken prayer, and a piteousness in the lingering of her hand in his harder to resist than ten thousand sad petitions. At last he had led her from the room and commended her to Helga\u2019s care. Then, returning to us, he stood silent a little while. We also were silent, Sapt sitting and looking up at him with his brows knit and his teeth restlessly chewing the moustache on his lip.\n\n\u201cWell, lad?\u201d he said at last, briefly putting the great question. Rudolf walked to the window and seemed to lose himself for a moment in the contemplation of the quiet night. There were no more than a few stragglers in the street now; the moon shone white and clear on the empty square.\n\u201cI should like to walk up and down outside and think it over,\u201d he said, turning to us; and, as Bernenstein sprang up to accompany him, he added, \u201cNo. Alone.\u201d\n\u201cYes, do,\u201d said old Sapt, with a glance at the clock, whose hands were now hard on two o\u2019clock. \u201cTake your time, lad, take your time.\u201d\nRudolf looked at him and broke into a smile.\n\u201cI\u2019m not your dupe, old Sapt,\u201d said he, shaking his head. \u201cTrust me, if I decide to get away, I\u2019ll get away, be it what o\u2019clock it will.\u201d\n\u201cYes, confound you!\u201d grinned Colonel Sapt."

  "H. Rider Haggard -- She and Allan": [
    "I believe it was the old Egyptians, a very wise people, probably indeed much wiser than we know, for in the leisure of their ample centuries they had time to think out things, who declared that each individual personality is made up of six or seven different elements, although the Bible only allows us three, namely, body, soul, and spirit. The body that the man or woman wore, if I understand their theory aright which perhaps I, an ignorant person, do not, was but a kind of sack or fleshly covering containing these different principles. Or mayhap it did not contain them all, but was simply a house as it were, in which they lived from time to time and seldom all together, although one or more of them was present continually, as though to keep the place warmed and aired.\n\nThis is but a casual illustrative suggestion, for what right have I, Allan Quatermain, out of my little reading and probably erroneous deductions, to form any judgment as to the theories of the old Egyptians? Still these, as I understand them, suffice to furnish me with the text that man is not one, but many, in which connection it may be remembered that often in Scripture he is spoken of as being the home of many demons, seven, I think. Also, to come to another far-off example, the Zulus talk of their witch-doctors as being inhabited by \u201ca multitude of spirits.\u201d\n\nAnyhow of one thing I am quite sure, we are not always the same. Different personalities actuate us at different times. In one hour passion of this sort or the other is our lord; in another we are reason itself. In one hour we follow the basest appetites; in another we hate them and the spirit arising through our mortal murk shines within or above us like a star. In one hour our desire is to kill and spare not; in another we are filled with the holiest compassion even towards an insect or a snake, and are ready to forgive like a god. Everything rules us in turn, to such an extent indeed, that sometimes one begins to wonder whether we really rule anything.\n\nNow the reason of all this homily is that I, Allan, the most practical and unimaginative of persons, just a homely, half-educated hunter and trader who chances to have seen a good deal of the particular little world in which his lot was cast, at one period of my life became the victim of spiritual longings.\n\nI am a man who has suffered great bereavements in my time such as have seared my soul, since, perhaps because of my rather primitive and simple nature, my affections are very strong. By day or night I can never forget those whom I have loved and whom I believe to have loved me.\n\nFor you know, in our vanity some of us are apt to hold that certain people with whom we have been intimate upon the earth, really did care for us and, in our still greater vanity\u2014or should it be called madness?\u2014to imagine that they still care for us after they have left the earth and entered on some new state of society and surroundings which, if they exist, inferentially are much more congenial than any they can have experienced here. At times, however, cold doubts strike us as to this matter, of which we long to know the truth. Also behind looms a still blacker doubt, namely whether they live at all.\n\nFor some years of my lonely existence these problems haunted me day by day, till at length I desired above everything on earth to lay them at rest in one way or another. Once, at Durban, I met a man who was a spiritualist to whom I confided a little of my perplexities. He laughed at me and said that they could be settled with the greatest ease. All I had to do was to visit a certain local medium who for a fee of one guinea would tell me everything I wanted to know. Although I rather grudged the guinea, being more than usually hard up at the time, I called upon this person, but over the results of that visit, or rather the lack of them, I draw a veil.\n\nMy queer and perhaps unwholesome longing, however, remained with me and would not be abated. I consulted a clergyman of my acquaintance, a good and spiritually-minded man, but he could only shrug his shoulders and refer me to the Bible, saying, quite rightly I doubt not, that with what it reveals I ought to be contented. Then I read certain mystical books which were recommended to me. These were full of fine words, undiscoverable in a pocket dictionary, but really took me no forwarder, since in them I found nothing that I could not have invented myself, although while I was actually studying them, they seemed to convince me. I even tackled Swedenborg, or rather samples of him, for he is very copious, but without satisfactory results.\n\nThen I gave up the business.\n\nSome months later I was in Zululand and being near the Black Kloof where he dwelt, I paid a visit to my acquaintance of whom I have written elsewhere, the wonderful and ancient dwarf, Zikali, known as \u201cThe-Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born,\u201d also more universally among the Zulus as \u201cOpener-of-Roads.\u201d When we had talked of many things connected with the state of Zululand and its politics, I rose to leave for my waggon, since I never cared for sleeping in the Black Kloof if it could be avoided.\n\n\u201cIs there nothing else that you want to ask me, Macumazahn?\u201d asked the old dwarf, tossing back his long hair and looking at\u2014I had almost written through\u2014me.\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\u201cThat is strange, Macumazahn, for I seem to see something written on your mind\u2014something to do with spirits.\u201d\n\nThen I remembered all the problems that had been troubling me, although in truth I had never thought of propounding them to Zikali.\n\n\u201cAh! it comes back, does it?\u201d he exclaimed, reading my thought. \u201cOut with it, then, Macumazahn, while I am in a mood to answer, and before I grow tired, for you are an old friend of mine and will so remain till the end, many years hence, and if I can serve you, I will.\u201d\n\nI filled my pipe and sat down again upon the stool of carved red-wood which had been brought for me.\n\n\u201cYou are named \u2018Opener-of-Roads,\u2019 are you not, Zikali?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes, the Zulus have always called me that, since before the days of Chaka. But what of names, which often enough mean nothing at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly that _I_ want to open a road, Zikali, that which runs across the River of Death.\u201d\n\n\u201cOho!\u201d he laughed, \u201cit is very easy,\u201d and snatching up a little assegai that lay beside him, he proffered it to me, adding, \u201cBe brave now and fall on that. Then before I have counted sixty the road will be wide open, but whether you will see anything on it I cannot tell you.\u201d\n\nAgain I shook my head and answered,\n\n\u201cIt is against our law. Also while I still live I desire to know whether I shall meet certain others on that road after my time has come to cross the River. Perhaps you who deal with spirits, can prove the matter to me, which no one else seems able to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cOho!\u201d laughed Zikali again. \u201cWhat do my ears hear? Am I, the poor Zulu cheat, as you will remember once you called me, Macumazahn, asked to show that which is hidden from all the wisdom of the great White People?\u201d",
    "\u201cWhy do you come to visit me, Macumazahn, who have never done so before?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not come to visit you, Umslopogaas. That was not my intention. You brought me, or rather the flooded rivers and you together brought me, for I was on my way to Natal and could not cross the drifts.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet I think you have a message for me, White Man, for not long ago a certain wandering witch-doctor who came here told me to expect you and that you had words to say to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he, Umslopogaas? Well, it is true that I have a message, though it is one that I did not mean to deliver.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet being here, perchance you will deliver it, Macumazahn, for those who have messages and will not speak them, sometimes come to trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, being here, I will deliver it, seeing that so it seems to be fated. Tell me, do you chance to know a certain Small One who is great, a certain Old One whose brain is young, a doctor who is called Opener-of-Roads?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard of him, as have my forefathers for generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, and if it pleases you to tell me, Umslopogaas, what might be the names of those forefathers of yours, who have heard of this doctor for generations? They must have been short-lived men and as such I should like to know of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you cannot,\u201d replied Umslopogaas shortly, \u201csince they are _hlonipa_ (i.e. not to be spoken) in this land.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said again. \u201cI thought that rule applied only to the names of kings, but of course I am but an ignorant white man who may well be mistaken on such matters of your Zulu customs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, O Macumazahn, you may be mistaken or\u2014you may not. It matters nothing. But what of this message of yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt came at the end of a long story, O Bulalio. But since you seek to know, these were the words of it, so nearly as I can remember them.\u201d\n\nThen sentence by sentence I repeated to him all that Zikali had said to me when he called me back after bidding me farewell, which doubtless he did because he wished to cut his message more deeply into the tablets of my mind.\n\nUmslopogaas listened to every syllable with a curious intentness, and then asked me to repeat it all again, which I did.\n\n\u201cLousta! Monazi!\u201d he said slowly. \u201cWell, you heard those names to-day, did you not, White Man? And you heard certain things from the lips of this Monazi who was angry, that give colour to that talk of the Opener-of-Roads. It seems to me,\u201d he added, glancing about him and speaking in a low voice, \u201cthat what I suspected is true and that without doubt I am betrayed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not understand,\u201d I replied indifferently. \u201cAll this talk is dark to me, as is the message of the Opener-of-Roads, or rather its meaning. By whom and about what are you betrayed?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet that snake sleep. Do not kick it with your foot. Suffice it you to know that my head hangs upon this matter; that I am a rat in a forked stick, and if the stick is pressed on by a heavy hand, then where is the rat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere all rats go, I suppose, that is, unless they are wise rats that bite the hand which holds the stick before it is pressed down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the rest of this story of yours, Macumazahn, which was told before the Opener-of-Roads gave you that message? Does it please you to repeat it to me that I may judge of it with my ears?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered, \u201con one condition, that what the ears hear, the heart shall keep to itself alone.\u201d\n\nUmslopogaas stooped and laid his hand upon the broad blade of the weapon beside him, saying,\n\n\u201cBy the Axe I swear it. If I break the oath be the Axe my doom.\u201d\n\nThen I told him the tale, as I have set it down already, thinking to myself that of it he would understand little, being but a wild warrior-man. As it chanced, however, I was mistaken, for he seemed to understand a great deal, perchance because such primitive natures are in closer touch with high and secret things than we imagine; perchance for other reasons with which I became acquainted later.\n\n\u201cIt stands thus,\u201d he said when I had finished, \u201cor so I think. You, Macumazahn, seek certain women who are dead to learn whether they still live, or are really dead, but so far have failed to find them. Still seeking, you asked the counsel of Zikali, Opener-of-Roads, he who among other titles is also called \u2018Home of Spirits.\u2019 He answered that he could not satisfy your heart because this tree was too tall for him to climb, but that far to the north there lives a certain white witch who has powers greater than his, being able to fly to the top of any tree, and to this white witch he bade you go. Have I the story right thus far?\u201d\n\nI answered that he had.\n\n\u201cGood! Then Zikali went on to choose you companions for your journey, but two, leaving out the guards or servants. I, Umhlopekazi, called Bulalio the Slaughterer, called the Woodpecker also, was one of these, and that little yellow monkey of a man whom I saw with you to-day, called Hansi, was the other. Then you made a mock of Zikali by determining not to visit me, Umhlopekazi, and not to go north to find the great white Queen of whom he had told you, but to return to Natal. Is that so?\u201d\n\nI said it was.\n\n\u201cThen the rain fell and the winds blew and the rivers rose in wrath so that you could not return to Natal, and after all by chance, or by fate, or by the will of Zikali, the wizard of wizards, you drifted here to the kraal of me, Umhlopekazi, and told me this story.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust so,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cWell, White Man, how am I to know that all this is not but a trap for my feet which already seem to feel cords between the toes of both of them? What token do you bring, O Watcher-by-Night? How am I to know that the Opener-of-Roads really sent me this message which has been delivered so strangely by one who wished to travel on another path? The wandering witch-doctor told me that he who came would bear some sign.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say,\u201d I answered, \u201cat least in words. But,\u201d I added after reflection, \u201cas you ask for a token, perhaps I might be able to show you something that would bring proof to your heart, if there were any secret place\u2014\u2014\u201d",
    "Now it had been my intention to push forward across the river at once, but here luck, or our old friend, Fate, was against me. To begin with several of Umslopogaas\u2019 men fell sick with a kind of stomach trouble, arising no doubt from something they had eaten. This, however, was not their view, or that of Umslopogaas himself. It happened that one of these men, Goroko by name, who practised as a witch-doctor in his lighter moments, naturally suspected that a spell had been cast upon them, for such people see magic in everything.\n\nTherefore he organised a \u201csmelling-out\u201d at which Umslopogaas, who was as superstitious as the rest, assisted. So did Hans, although he called himself a Christian, partly out of curiosity, for he was as curious as a magpie, and partly from fear lest some implication should be brought against him in his absence. I saw the business going on from a little distance, and, unseen myself, thought it well to keep an eye upon the proceedings in case anything untoward should occur. This I did with Miss Inez, who had never witnessed anything of the sort, as a companion.\n\nThe circle, a small one, was formed in the usual fashion; Goroko rigged up in the best witch-doctor\u2019s costume that he could improvise, duly came under the influence of his \u201cSpirit\u201d and skipped about, waving a wildebeeste\u2019s tail, and so forth.\n\nFinally to my horror he broke out of the ring, and running to a group of spectators from the village, switched Thomaso, who was standing among them with a lordly and contemptuous air, across the face with the gnu\u2019s tail, shouting out that he was the wizard who had poisoned the bowels of the sick men. Thereon Thomaso, who although he could be insolent, like most crossbreeds was not remarkable for courage, seeing the stir that this announcement created amongst the fierce-faced Zulus and fearing developments, promptly bolted, none attempting to follow him.\n\nAfter this, just as I thought that everything was over and that the time had come for me to speak a few earnest words to Umslopogaas, pointing out that matters must go no further as regards Thomaso, whom I knew that he and his people hated, Goroko went back to the circle and was seized with a new burst of inspiration.\n\nThrowing down his whisk, he lifted his arms above his head and stared at the heavens. Then he began to shout out something in a loud voice which I was too far off to catch. Whatever it may have been, evidently it frightened his hearers, as I could see from the expressions on their faces. Even Umslopogaas was alarmed, for he let his axe fall for a moment, rose as though to speak, then sat down again and covered his eyes with his hands.\n\nIn a minute it was over; Goroko seemed to become normal, took some snuff and as I guessed, after the usual fashion of these doctors, began to ask what he had been saying while the \u201cSpirit\u201d possessed him, which he either had, or affected to have, forgotten. The circle, too, broke up and its members began to talk to each other in a subdued way, while Umslopogaas remained seated on the ground, brooding, and Hans slipped away in his snake-like fashion, doubtless in search of me.\n\n\u201cWhat was it all about, Mr. Quatermain?\u201d asked Inez.\n\n\u201cOh! a lot of nonsense,\u201d I said. \u201cI fancy that witch-doctor declared that your friend Thomaso put something into those men\u2019s food to make them sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI daresay that he did; it would be just like him, Mr. Quatermain, as I know that he hates them, especially Umslopogaas, of whom I am very fond. He brought me some beautiful flowers this morning which he had found somewhere, and made a long speech which I could not understand.\u201d\n\nThe idea of Umslopogaas, that man of blood and iron, bringing flowers to a young lady, was so absurd that I broke out laughing and even the sad-faced Inez smiled. Then she left me to see about something and I went to speak to Hans and asked him what had happened.\n\n\u201cSomething rather queer, I think, Baas,\u201d he answered vacuously, \u201cthough I did not quite understand the last part. The doctor, Goroko, smelt out Thomaso as the man who had made them sick, and though they will not kill him because we are guests here, those Zulus are very angry with Thomaso and I think will beat him if they get a chance. But that is only the small half of the stick,\u201d and he paused.\n\n\u201cWhat is the big half, then?\u201d I asked with irritation.\n\n\u201cBaas, the Spirit in Goroko\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe jackass in Goroko, you mean,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cHow can you, who are a Christian, talk such rubbish about spirits? I only wish that my father could hear you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Baas, your reverend father, the Predikant, is now wise enough to know all about Spirits and that there are some who come into black witch-doctors though they turn up their noses at white men and leave them alone. However, whatever it is that makes Goroko speak, got hold of him so that his lips said, though he remembered nothing of it afterwards, that soon this place would be red with blood\u2014that there would be a great killing here, Baas. That is all.\u201d\n\n\u201cRed with blood! Whose blood? What did the fool mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Baas, but what you call the jackass in Goroko, declared that those who are \u2018with the Great Medicine\u2019\u2014meaning what you wear, Baas\u2014will be quite safe. So I hope that it will not be our blood; also that you will get out of this place as soon as you can.\u201d\n\nWell, I scolded Hans because he believed in what this doctor said, for I could see that he did believe it, then went to question Umslopogaas, whom I found looking quite pleased, which annoyed me still more.\n\n\u201cWhat is it that Goroko has been saying and why do you smile, Bulalio?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNothing much, Macumazahn, except that the man who looks like tallow that has gone bad, put something in our food which made us sick, for which I would kill him were he not Red-beard\u2019s servant and that it would frighten the lady his daughter. Also he said that soon there will be fighting, which is why I smiled, who grow weary of peace. We came out to fight, did we not?\u201d",
    "\u201cWhat is the matter, Hans?\u201d I asked when we were within speaking distance.\n\n\u201cOh! Baas, everything,\u201d he answered, and I noticed that he kept his eyes fixed upon the ground and that his lips twitched.\n\n\u201cSpeak, you fool, and in Zulu,\u201d I said, for by now Umslopogaas had joined me.\n\n\u201cBaas,\u201d he answered in that tongue, \u201ca terrible thing has come about at the farm of Red-Beard yonder. Yesterday afternoon at the time when people are in the habit of sleeping there till the sun grows less hot, a body of great men with fierce faces who carried big spears\u2014perhaps there were fifty of them, Baas\u2014crept up to the place through the long grass and growing crops, and attacked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see them come?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo, Baas. I was watching at a little distance as you bade me do and the sun being hot, I shut my eyes to keep out the glare of it, so that I did not see them until they had passed me and heard the noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean that you were asleep or drunk, Hans, but go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBaas, I do not know,\u201d he answered shamefacedly, \u201cbut after that I climbed a tall tree with a kind of bush at the top of it\u201d (I ascertained afterwards that this was a sort of leafy-crowned palm), \u201cand from it I saw everything without being seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you see, Hans?\u201d I asked him.\n\n\u201cI saw the big men run up and make a kind of circle round the village. Then they shouted, and the people in the village came out to see what was the matter. Thomaso and some of the men caught sight of them first and ran away fast into the hillside at the back where the trees grow, before the circle was complete. Then the women and the children came out and the big men killed them with their spears\u2014all, all!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood God!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cAnd what happened at the house and to the lady?\u201d\n\n\u201cBaas, some of the men had surrounded that also and when she heard the noise the lady Sad-Eyes came out on to the stoep and with her came the two Zulus of the Axe who had been left sick but were now quite recovered. A number of the big men ran as though to take her, but the two Zulus made a great fight in front of the little steps to the stoep, having their backs protected by the stoep, and killed six of them before they themselves were killed. Also Sad-Eyes shot one with a pistol she carried, and wounded another so that the spear fell out of his hand. Then the rest fell on her and tied her up, setting her in a chair on the stoep where two remained to watch her. They did her no hurt, Baas; indeed, they seemed to treat her as gently as they could. Also they went into the house and there they caught that tall fat yellow girl who always smiles and is called Janee, she who waits upon the Lady Sad-Eyes, and brought her out to her. I think they told her, Baas, that she must look after her mistress and that if she tried to run away she would be killed, for afterwards I saw Janee bring her food and other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then, Hans?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, Baas, most of the great men rested a while, though some of them went through the store gathering such things as they liked, blankets, knives and iron cooking-pots, but they set fire to nothing, nor did they try to catch the cattle. Also they took dry wood from the pile and lit big fires, eight or nine of them, and when the sun set they began to feast.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did they feast on, Hans, if they took no cattle?\u201d I asked with a shiver, for I was afraid of I knew not what.\n\n\u201cBaas,\u201d answered Hans, turning his head away and looking at the ground, \u201cthey feasted on the children whom they had killed, also on some of the young women. These tall soldiers are men-eaters, Baas.\u201d\n\nAt this horrible intelligence I turned faint and felt as though I was going to fall, but recovering myself, signed to him to go on with his story.\n\n\u201cThey feasted quite nicely, Baas,\u201d he continued, \u201cmaking no noise. Then some of them slept while others watched, and that went on all night. As soon as it was dark, but before the moon rose, I slid down the tree and crept round to the back of the house without being seen or heard, as I can, Baas. I got into the house by the back door and crawled to the window of the sitting-room. It was open and peeping through I saw Sad-Eyes still tied to the seat on the stoep not more than a pace away, while the girl Janee crouched on the floor at her feet\u2014I think she was asleep or fainting. I made a little noise, like a night-adder hissing, and kept on making it, till at last Sad-Eyes turned her head. Then I spoke in a very low whisper, for fear lest I should wake the two guards who were dozing on either side of her wrapped in their blankets, saying, \u2018It is I, Hans, come to help you.\u2019 \u2018You cannot,\u2019 she answered, also speaking very low. \u2018Get to your master and tell him and my father to follow. These men are called Amahagger and live far away across the river. They are going to take me to their home, as I understand, to rule them, because they want a white woman to be a queen over them who have always been ruled by a certain white queen, against whom they have rebelled. I do not think they mean to do me any harm, unless perhaps they want to marry me to their chief, but of this I am not sure from their talk which I understand badly. Now go, before they catch you.\u2019 \u2018I think you might get away,\u2019 I whispered back. \u2018I will cut your bonds. When you are free, slip through the window and I will guide you.\u2019 \u2018Very well, try it,\u2019 she said. So I drew my knife and stretched out my arm. But then, Baas, I showed myself a fool\u2014if the Great Medicine had still been there I might have known better. I forgot the starlight which shone upon the blade of the knife. That girl Janee came out of her sleep or swoon, lifted her head and saw the knife. She screamed once, then at a word from her mistress was silent. But it was enough, for it woke up the guards who glared about them and threatened Janee with their great spears, also they went to sleep no more, but began to talk together, though what they said I could not hear, for I was hiding on the floor of the room. After this, knowing that I could do no good and might do harm and get myself killed, I crept out of the house as I had crept in, and crawled back to my tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you not come to me?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cBecause I still hoped I might be able to help Sad-Eyes, Baas. Also I wanted to see what happened, and I knew that I could not bring you here in time to be any good. Yet it is true I thought of coming though I did not know the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you were right.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the first dawn,\u201d continued Hans, \u201cthe great men who are called Amahagger rose and ate what was left over from the night before. Then they gathered themselves together and went to the house. Here they found a large chair, that seated with _rimpis_ in which the Baas Red-Beard sits, and lashed two poles to the chair. Beneath the chair they tied the garments and other things of the Lady Sad-Eyes which they made Janee gather as Sad-Eyes directed her. This done, very gently they sat Sad-Eyes herself in the chair, bowing while they made her fast. After this eight of them set the poles upon their shoulders, and they all went away at a trot, heading for the bush-veld, driving with them a herd of goats which they had stolen from the farm, and making Janee run by the chair. I saw everything, Baas, for they passed just beneath my tree. Then I came to seek you, following the outward spoor of the waggons which I could not have done well at night. That is all, Baas.\u201d",
    "Now it would be useless for me to set out the details of this prolonged and arduous chase which in all endured for something over three weeks. Again and again we lost the trail and were only able to recover it by long and elaborate search, which occupied much time. Then, after we escaped from the reeds and swamps, we found ourselves upon stony uplands where the spoor was almost impossible to follow, indeed, we only rediscovered it by stumbling across the dead body of that cannibal whom Inez had wounded. Evidently he had perished from his hurt, which I could see had mortified. From the state of his remains we gathered that the raiders must be about two days\u2019 march ahead of us. Striking their spoor again on softer ground where the impress of their feet remained\u2014at any rate to the cunning sight of Hans\u2014we followed them down across great valleys wherein trees grew sparsely, which valleys were separated from each other by ridges of high and barren land. On these belts of rocky soil our difficulties were great, but here twice we were put on the right track by more fragments torn from the dress of Inez.\n\nAt length we lost the spoor altogether; not a sign of it was to be found. We had no idea which way to go. All about us appeared these valleys covered with scattered bush running this way and that, so that we could not tell which of them to follow or to cross. The thing seemed hopeless, for how could we expect to find a little body of men in that immensity? Hans shook his head and even the fierce and steadfast Robertson was discouraged.\n\n\u201cI fear my poor lassie is gone,\u201d he said, and relapsed into brooding as had become his wont.\n\n\u201cNever say die! It\u2019s dogged as does it!\u201d I replied cheerfully in the words of Nelson, who also had learned what it meant to hunt an enemy over trackless wastes, although his were of water.\n\nI walked to the top of the rise where we were encamped, and sat down alone to think matters over. Our condition was somewhat parlous; all our beasts were now dead, even the second donkey, which was the last of them, having perished that morning, and been eaten, for food was scanty since of late we had met with little game. The Strathmuir men, who now must carry the loads, were almost worn out and doubtless would have deserted, except for the fact that there was no place to which they could go. Even the Zulus were discouraged, and said they had come away from home across the Great River to fight, not to run about in wildernesses and starve, though Umslopogaas made no complaint, being buoyed up by the promise of his soothsayer, Goroko, that battle was ahead of him in which he would win great glory. Hans, however, remained cheerful, for the reason, as he remarked vacuously, that the Great Medicine was with us and that therefore, however bad things seemed to be, all in fact was well; an argument that carried no conviction to my soul.\n\nIt was on a certain evening towards sunset that I went away thus alone. I looked about me, east and west and north. Everywhere appeared the same bush-clad valleys and barren rises, miles upon miles of them. I bethought me of the map that old Zikali had drawn in the ashes, and remembered that it showed these valleys and rises and that beyond them there should be a great swamp, and beyond the swamp a mountain. So it seemed that we were on the right road to the home of his white Queen, if such a person existed, or at any rate we were passing over country similar to that which he had pictured or imagined. But at this time I was not troubling my head about white queens. I was thinking of poor Inez. That she was alive a few days before we knew from the fragments of her dress. But where was she now? The spoor was utterly lost on that stony ground, or if any traces of it remained a heavy deluge of rain had washed them away. Even Hans had confessed himself beaten.\n\nI stared about me helplessly, and as I did so a flying ray of light from the setting sun reflected downwards from a storm-cloud, fell upon a white patch on the crest of one of the distant land-waves. It struck me that probably limestone outcropped at this spot, as indeed proved to be the case; also that such a patch of white would be a convenient guide for any who were travelling across that sea of bush. Further, some instinct within seemed to impel me to steer for it, although I had all but made up my mind to go in a totally different direction many more points to the east. It was almost as though a voice were calling to me to take this path and no other. Doubtless this was an effect produced by weariness and mental overstrain. Still, there it was, very real and tangible, one that I did not attempt to combat.\n\nSo next morning at the dawn I headed north by west, laying my course for that white patch and for the first time breaking the straight line of our advance. Captain Robertson, whose temper had not been bettered by prolonged and frightful anxiety, or I may add, by his unaccustomed abstinence, asked me rather roughly why I was altering the course.\n\n\u201cLook here, Captain,\u201d I answered, \u201cif we were at sea and you did something of the sort, I should not put such a question to you, and if by any chance I did, I should not expect you to answer. Well, by your own wish I am in command here and I think that the same argument holds.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cI suppose you have studied your chart, if there is any of this God-forsaken country, and at any rate discipline is discipline. So steam ahead and don\u2019t mind me.\u201d\n\nThe others accepted my decision without comment; most of them were so miserable that they did not care which way we went, also they were good enough to repose confidence in my judgment.\n\n\u201cDoubtless the Baas has reasons,\u201d said Hans dubiously, \u201calthough the spoor, when last we saw it, headed towards the rising sun and as the country is all the same, I do not see why those man-eaters should have returned.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cI have reasons,\u201d although in fact I had none at all.\n\nHans surveyed me with a watery eye as though waiting for me to explain them, but I looked haughty and declined to oblige.\n\n\u201cThe Baas has reasons,\u201d continued Hans, \u201cfor taking us on what I think to be the wrong side of that great ridge, there to hunt for the spoor of the men-eaters, and they are so deep down in his mind that he cannot dig them up for poor old Hans to look at. Well, the Baas wears the Great Medicine and perhaps it is there that the reasons sit. Those Strathmuir fellows say that they can go no further and wish to die. Umslopogaas has just gone to them with his axe to tell them that he is ready to help them to their wish. Look, he has got there, for they are coming quickly, who after all prefer to live.\u201d\n\nWell, we started for my white patch of stones which no one else had noticed and of which I said nothing to anyone, and reached it by the following evening, to find, as I expected, that it was a lime outcrop.",
    "Walking under what I took to be a great arch or portico, we came into a court that was full of towering pillars but unroofed, for I could see the stars above. At its end we entered a building of which the doorway was hung with mats, to find that it was lighted with lamps and that all down its length on either side guards with long spears stood at intervals.\n\n\u201cOh, Baas,\u201d said Hans hesitatingly, \u201cthis is the mouth of a trap,\u201d while Umslopogaas glared about him suspiciously, fingering the handle of his great axe.\n\n\u201cBe silent,\u201d I answered. \u201cAll this mountain is a trap, therefore another does not matter, and we have our pistols.\u201d\n\nWalking forward between the double line of guards who stood immovable as statues, we came to some curtains hung at the end of a long, narrow hall which, although I know little of such things, were, I noted, made of rich stuff embroidered in colours and with golden threads. Before these curtains Billali motioned us to halt. After a whispered colloquy with someone beyond carried on through the join of the curtains, he vanished between them, leaving us alone for five minutes or more. At length they opened and a tall and elegant woman with an Arab cast of countenance and clad in white robes, appeared and beckoned to us to enter. She did not speak or answer when I spoke to her, which was not wonderful as afterwards I discovered that she was a mute. We went in, I wondering very much what we were going to see.\n\nOn the further side of the curtains was a room of no great size illumined with lamps of which the light fell upon sculptured walls. It looked to me as though it might once have been the inmost court or a sanctuary of some temple, for at its head was a dais upon which once perhaps had stood the shrine or statue of a god. On this dais there was now a couch and on the couch\u2014a goddess!\n\nThere she sat, straight and still, clothed in shining white and veiled, but with her draperies so arranged that they emphasised rather than concealed the wonderful elegance of her tall form. From beneath the veil, which was such as a bride wears, appeared two plaits of glossy, raven hair of great length, to the end of each of which was suspended a single large pearl. On either side of her stood a tall woman like to her who had led us through the curtains, and on his knees in front, but to the right, knelt Billali.\n\nAbout this seated personage there was an air of singular majesty, such as might pervade a queen as fancy paints her, though she had a nobler figure than any queen I ever saw depicted. Mystery seemed to flow from her; it clothed her like the veil she wore, which of course heightened the effect. Beauty flowed from her also; although it was shrouded I knew that it was there, no veil or coverings could obscure it\u2014at least, to my imagination. Moreover she breathed out power also; one felt it in the air as one feels a thunderstorm before it breaks, and it seemed to me that this power was not quite human, that it drew its strength from afar and dwelt a stranger to the earth.\n\nTo tell the truth, although my curiosity, always strong, was enormously excited and though now I felt glad that I had attempted this journey with all its perils, I was horribly afraid, so much afraid that I should have liked to turn and run away. From the beginning I knew myself to be in the presence of an unearthly being clothed in soft and perfect woman\u2019s flesh, something alien, too, and different from our human race.\n\nWhat a picture it all made! There she sat, quiet and stately as a perfect marble statue; only her breast, rising and falling beneath the white robe, showed that she was alive and breathed as others do. Another thing showed it also\u2014her eyes. At first I could not see them through the veil, but presently either because I grew accustomed to the light, or because they brightened as those of certain animals have power to do when they watch intently, it ceased to be a covering to them. Distinctly I saw them now, large and dark and splendid with a tinge of deep blue in the iris; alluring and yet awful in their majestic aloofness which seemed to look through and beyond, to embrace all without seeking and without effort. Those eyes were like windows through which light flows from within, a light of the spirit.\n\nI glanced round to see the effect of this vision upon my companions. It was most peculiar. Hans had sunk to his knees; his hands were joined in the attitude of prayer and his ugly little face reminded me of that of a big fish out of water and dying from excess of air. Robertson, startled out of his abstraction, stared at the royal-looking woman on the couch with his mouth open.\n\n\u201cMan,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve got them back although I have touched nothing for weeks, only this time they are lovely. For yon\u2019s no human lady, I feel it in my bones.\u201d\n\nUmslopogaas stood great and grim, his hands resting on the handle of his tall axe; and he stared also, the blood pulsing against the skin that covered the hole in his head.\n\n\u201cWatcher-by-Night,\u201d he said to me in his deep voice, but also speaking in a whisper, \u201cthis chieftainess is not one woman, but all women. Beneath those robes of hers I seem to see the beauty of one who has \u2018gone Beyond,\u2019 of the Lily who is lost to me. Do you not feel it thus, Macumazahn?\u201d",
    "\u201cListen,\u201d she said after a while, \u201cI will tell you a story and when you have heard it you shall answer, even if you do not believe it, but not before. Does it please you to listen to something of the tale of my life which I am moved to tell you, that you may know with whom you have to deal?\u201d\n\nAgain I bowed, thinking to myself that I knew nothing that would please me more, who was eaten up with a devouring curiosity about this woman.\n\nNow she rose from her couch and descending off the dais, began to walk up and down the chamber. I say, to walk, but her movements were more like the gliding of an eagle through the air or the motion of a swan upon still water, so smooth were they and gracious. As she walked she spoke in a low and thrilling voice.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d she said again, \u201cand even if my story seems marvellous to you, interrupt, and above all, mock me not, lest I should grow angry, which might be ill for you. I am not as other women are, O Allan, who having conquered the secrets of Nature,\u201d here I felt an intense desire to ask what secrets, but remembered and held my tongue, \u201cto my sorrow have preserved my youth and beauty through many ages. Moreover in the past, perhaps in payment for my sins, I have lived other lives of which some memory remains with me. By my last birth I am an Arab lady of royal blood, a descendant of the Kings of the East. There I dwelt in the wilderness and ruled a people, and at night I gathered wisdom from the stars and the spirits of the earth and air. At length I wearied of it all and my people too wearied of me and besought me to depart, for, Allan, I would have naught to do with men, yet men went mad because of my beauty and slew each other out of jealousy. Moreover other peoples made war upon my people, hoping to take me captive that I might be a wife to their kings. So I left them, and being furnished with great wealth in hoarded gold and jewels, together with a certain holy man, my master, I wandered through the world, studying the nations and their worships. At Jerusalem I tarried and learned of Jehovah who is, or was, its God. At Paphos in the Isle of Chitim I dwelt a while till the folk of that city thought that I was Aphrodite returned to earth and sought to worship me. For this reason and because I made a mock of Aphrodite, I, who, as I have said, would have naught to do with men, she through her priests cursed me, saying that her yoke should lie more heavily upon my neck from age to age than on that of any woman who had breathed beneath the sun.\n\nIt was a wondrous scene,\u201d she added reflectively, \u201cthat of the cursing, since for every word I gave back two. Moreover I told the hoary villain of a high-priest to make report to his goddess that long after she was dead in the world, I would live on, for the spirit of prophecy was on me in that hour. Yet the curse fell in its season, since in her day, doubt it or not, Aphrodite had strength, as indeed under other names she has and will have while the world endures, and for aught I know, beyond it. Do they worship her now in any land, Allan?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, only her statues because of their beauty, though Love is always worshipped.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, who can testify to that better than you yourself, Allan, if he who is called Zikali tells me the truth concerning you in the dreams he sends? As for the statues, I saw some of them as they left the master\u2019s hand in Greece, and when I told him that he might have found a better model, once I was that model. If this marble still endures, it must be the most famous of them all, though perchance Aphrodite has shattered it in her jealous rage. You shall tell me of these statues afterwards; mine had a mark on the left shoulder like to a mole, but the stone was imperfect, not my flesh, as I can prove if you should wish.\u201d\n\nThinking it better not to enter on a discussion as to Ayesha\u2019s shoulder, I remained silent and she went on.\n\n\u201cI dwelt in Egypt also, and there, to be rid of men who wearied me with their sighs and importunities, also to acquire more wisdom of which she was the mistress, I entered the service of the goddess Isis, Queen of Heaven, vowing to remain virgin for ever. Soon I became her high-priestess and in her most sacred shrines upon the Nile, I communed with the goddess and shared her power, since from me her daughter, she withheld none of her secrets. So it came about that though Pharaohs held the sceptre, it was I who ruled Egypt and brought it and Sidon to their fall, it matters not how or why, as it was fated that I must do. Yes, kings would come to seek counsel from me where I sat throned, dressed in the garb of Isis and breathing out her power. Yet, my task accomplished, of it all I grew weary, as men will surely do of the heavens that they preach, should they chance to find them.\u201d\n\nI wondered what this \u201ctask\u201d might be, but only asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause in their pictured heaven all things lie to their hands and man, being man, cannot be happy without struggle, and woman, being woman, without victory over others. What is cheaply bought, or given, has no value, Allan; to be enjoyed, it must first be won. But I bade you not to break my thought.\u201d\n\n\nI asked pardon and she went on,\n\n\u201cThen it was that the shadow of the curse of Aphrodite fell upon me, yes, and of the curse of Isis also, so that these twin maledictions have made me what I am, a lost soul dwelling in the wilderness waiting the fulfilment of a fate whereof I know not the end. For though I have all wisdom, all knowledge of the Past and much power together with the gift of life and beauty, the future is as dark to me as night without its moon and stars. Hearken, this chanced to me. Though it be to my shame I tell it you that all may be clear. At a temple of Isis on the Nile where I ruled, there was a certain priest, a Greek by birth, vowed like myself to the service of the goddess and therefore to wed none but her, the goddess herself\u2014that is, in the spirit. He was named Kallikrates, a man of courage and of beauty, such an one as those Greeks carved in the statues of their god Apollo. Never, I think, was a man more beautiful in face and form, though in soul he was not great, as often happens to men who have all else, and well-nigh always happens to women, save myself and perhaps one or two others that history tells of, doubtless magnifying their fabled charms. The Pharaoh of that day, the last of the native blood, him whom the Persians drove to doom, had a daughter, the Princess of Egypt, Amenartas by name, a fair woman in her fashion, though somewhat swarthy. In her youth this Amenartas became enamoured of Kallikrates and he of her, when he was a captain of the Grecian Mercenaries at Pharaoh\u2019s Court. Indeed, she brought blood upon his hands because of her, wherefore he fled to Isis for forgiveness and for peace. Thither in after time she followed him and again urged her love. Learning of the thing and knowing it for sacrilege, I summoned this priest and warned him of his danger and of the doom which awaited him should he continue in that path. He grew affrighted. He flung himself upon the ground before me with groans and supplications, and kissing my feet, vowed most falsely to me that his dealings with the royal Amenartas were but a veil and that it was I whom he worshipped. His unhallowed words filled me with horror and sternly I bade him begone and do penance for his crime, saying that I would pray the goddess on behalf of him. He went, leaving me alone lost in thought in the darkening shrine. Then sleep fell on me and in my sleep I dreamed a dream, or saw a vision. For suddenly there stood before me a woman beauteous as myself clad in nothing save a golden girdle and a veil of gossamer.\n\n\u2018O Ayesha,\u2019 she said in a honeyed voice, \u2018priestess of Isis of the Egyptians, sworn to the barren worship of Isis and fed on the ashes of her unprofitable wisdom, know that I am Aphrodite of the Greeks whom many times thou hast mocked and defied, and Queen of the breathing world, as Isis is Queen of the world that is dead. Now because thou didst despise me and pour contempt upon my name, I smite thee with my strength and lay a curse upon thee. It is that thou shalt love and desire this man who but now hath kissed thy feet, ever longing till the world\u2019s end to kiss his lips in payment, although thou art as far above him as the moon thou servest is above the Nile. Think not that thou shalt escape my doom, for know that however strong the spirit, here upon the earth the flesh is stronger still and of all flesh I am the queen.\u2019\n\nThen she laughed softly and smiting me across the eyes with a lock of her scented hair, was gone. Allan, I awoke from my sleep and a great trouble fell upon me, for I who had never loved before now was rent with a rage of love and for this man who till that moment had been naught to me but as some beauteous image of gold and ivory. I longed for him, my heart was racked with jealousy because of the Egyptian who favoured him, an eating flame possessed my breast. I grew mad. There in the shrine of Isis the divine I cast myself upon my knees and cried to Aphrodite to return and give me him I sought, for whose sake I would renounce all else, even if I must pour my wisdom into a beauteous, empty cup. Yes, thus I prayed and lay upon the ground and wept until, outworn, once more sleep fell upon me. Now in the darkness of the holy place once more there came a dream or vision, since before me in her glory stood the goddess Isis crowned with the crescent of the young moon and holding in her hand the jewelled _sistrum_ that is her symbol, from which came music like to the melody of distant bells. She gazed at me and in her great eyes were scorn and anger.\n\n\u2018O Ayesha, Daughter of Wisdom,\u2019 she said in a solemn voice, \u2018whom I, Isis, had come to look upon rather as a child than a servant, since in none other of my priestesses was such greatness to be found, and whom in a day to be I had purposed to raise to the very steps of my heavenly throne, thou hast broken thine oath and, forsaking me, hast worshipped false Aphrodite of the Greeks who is mine enemy. Yea, in the eternal war between the spirit and the flesh, thou hast chosen the part of flesh. Therefore I hate thee and add my doom to that which Aphrodite laid upon thee, which, hadst thou prayed to me and not to her, I would have lifted from thy heart. Hearken! The Grecian whom thou hast chosen, by Aphrodite\u2019s will, thou shalt love as the Pathian said. More, thy love shall bring his blood upon thy hands, nor mayest thou follow him to the grave. For I will show thee the Source of Life and thou shalt drink of it to make thyself more fair even than thou art and thus outpace thy rival, and when thy lover is dead, in a desolate place thou shalt wait in grief and solitude till he is born again and find thee there. Yet shall this be but the beginning of thy sorrows, since through all time thou shalt pursue thy fate till at length thou canst draw up this man to the height on which thine own soul stands by the ropes of love and loss and suffering. Moreover through it all thou shalt despise thyself, which is man\u2019s and woman\u2019s hardest lot, thou who having the rare feast of spirit spread out before thee, hast chosen to fill thyself from the troughs of flesh.\u2019\n\nThen, Allan, in my dream I made a proud answer to the goddess, saying, \u2018Hear me, mighty mistress of many Forms who dost appear in all that lives! An evil fate has fallen upon me, but was it I who chose that fate? Can the leaf contend against the driving gale? Can the falling stone turn upwards to the sky, or when Nature draws it, can the tide cease to flow? A goddess whom I have offended, that goddess whose strength causes the whole world to be, has laid her curse upon me and because I have bent before the storm, as bend I must, or break, another goddess whom I serve, thou thyself, Mother Isis, hast added to the curse. Where then is Justice, O Lady of the Moon?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not here, Woman,\u2019 she answered. \u2018Yet far away Justice lives and shall be won at last and mayhap because thou art so proud and high-stomached, it is laid upon thee to seek her blinded eyes through many an age. Yet at last I think thou shalt set thy sins against her weights and find the balance even. Therefore cease from questioning the high decrees of destiny which thou canst not understand and be content to suffer, remembering that all joy grows from the root of pain. Moreover, know this for thy comfort, that the wisdom which thou hast shall grow and gather on thee and with it thy beauty and thy power; also that at the last thou shalt look upon my face again, in token whereof I leave to thee my symbol, the _sistrum_ that I bear, and with it this command. Follow that false priest of mine wherever he may go and avenge me upon him, and if thou lose him there, wait while the generations pass till he return again. Such and no other is thy destiny.\u2019\n\nAllan, the vision faded and when I awoke the lights of dawn played upon the image of the goddess in the sanctuary. They played, moreover, upon the holy jewelled thing that in my dream her hand had held, the _sistrum_ of her worship, shaped like the loop of life, the magic symbol that she had vowed to me, wherewith goes her power, which henceforth was mine. I took it and followed after the priest Kallikrates, to whom thenceforward I was bound by passion\u2019s ties that are stronger than all the goddesses in this wide universe.\u201d\n\nHere I, Allan, could contain myself no longer and asked, \u201cWhat for?\u201d then, fearing her wrath, wished that I had been silent.\n\nBut she was not angry, perhaps because this tale of her interviews with goddesses, doubtless fabled, had made her humble, for she answered quietly,\n\n\u201cBy Aphrodite, or by Isis, or both of them I did not know. All I knew was that I _must_ seek him, then and evermore, as seek I do to-day and shall perchance through \u00e6ons yet unborn. So I followed, as I was taught and commanded, the _sistrum_ being my guide, how it matters not, and giving me the means, and so at last I came to this ancient land whereof the ruin in which you sit was once known as K\u00f4r.\u201d",
    "Now the reader, presuming the existence of such a person, will think that everything is sure to go right; that this cunning old fellow, Allan Quatermain, is going to surprise and wipe the floor with those Rezuites, who were already beguiled by the trick he had instructed Goroko to play. That after this he will rescue Robertson who doubtless shortly recovers his mind, also Inez with the greatest ease, in fact that everything will happen as it ought to do if this were a romance instead of a mere record of remarkable facts. But being the latter, as it happened, matters did not work out quite in this convenient way.\n\nTo begin with, when those Amahagger told me that the Rezuites never fought in the dark or before the sun was well up, either they lied or they were much mistaken, for at any rate on this occasion they did the exact contrary. All the while that we thought we were stalking them, they were stalking us. The Goroko manoeuvre had not deceived them in the least, since from their spies they knew its exact significance.\n\nHere, I may add that those spies were in our own ranks, traitors, in short, who were really in the pay of Rezu and possibly belonged to his abominable faith, some of whom slipped away from time to time to the enemy to report our progress and plans, so far as they knew them.\n\nFurther, what Hans had stumbled on was a mere rear guard left around the place of sacrifice and the hut where Inez was confined. The real army he never found at all. That was divided into two bodies and hidden in bush to the right and left of the ridge which we were descending just at the spot where it joined the plain beneath, and into the jaws of these two armies we marched gaily.\n\nNow that hypothetical reader will say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t that silly old fool, Allan, think of all these things? Why didn\u2019t he remember that he was commanding a pack of savages with whom he had no real acquaintance, among whom there were sure to be traitors, especially as they were of the same blood as the Rezuites, and take precautions?\u201d\n\nAh! my dear reader, I will only answer that I wish you had handled the job yourself, and enjoyed the opportunity of seeing what _you_ could do in the circumstances. Do you suppose I didn\u2019t think of all these points? Of course I did. But have you ever heard of the difficulty of making silk purses out of sows\u2019 ears, or of turning a lot of gloomy and disagreeable barbarians whom you had never even drilled, into trustworthy and efficient soldiers ready to fight three times their own number and beat them?\n\nAlso I beg to observe that I did get through somehow, as you shall learn, which is more than you might have done, Mr. Wisdom, though I admit, not without help from another quarter. It is all very well for you to sit in your armchair and be sapient and turn up your learned nose, like the gentlemen who criticise plays and poems, an easy job compared to the writing of them. From all of which, however, you will understand that I am, to tell the truth, rather ashamed of what followed, since _qui s\u2019excuse, s\u2019accuse_.\n\nAs we slunk down that hill in the moonlight, a queer-looking crowd, I admit also that I felt very uncomfortable. To begin with I did not like that remark of the Medicine-man which Hans reported, to the effect that the feast must come after the victory, especially as he had said just before that Robertson was to be sacrificed as the sun rose, which would seem to suggest that the \u201cvictory\u201d was planned to take place before that event.\n\nWhile I was ruminating upon this subject, I looked round for Hans to cross-examine him as to the priest\u2019s exact words, only to find that he had slunk off somewhere. A few minutes later he reappeared running back towards us swiftly and, I noticed, taking shelter behind tree trunks and rocks as he came.\n\n\u201cBaas,\u201d he gasped, for he was out of breath, \u201cbe careful, those Rezu men are on either side ahead. I went forward and ran into them. They threw many spears at me. Look!\u201d and he showed a slight cut on his arm from which blood was flowing.\n\nInstantly I understood that we were ambushed and began to think very hard indeed. As it chanced we were passing across a large flat space upon the ridge, say seven or eight acres in extent, where the bush grew lightly, though owing to the soil being better, the trees were tall.\n\nOn the steep slope below this little plain it seemed to be denser and there it was, according to Hans, that the ambush was set. I halted my regiment and sent back messengers to the others that they were to halt also as they came up, on the pretext of giving them a rest before they were marshalled and we advanced to the battle.\n\nThen I told Umslopogaas what Hans said and asked him to send out his Zulu soldier whom he could trust, to see if he could obtain confirmation of the report. This he did at once. Also I asked him what he thought should be done, supposing that it was true.\n\n\u201cForm the Amahagger into a ring or a square and await attack,\u201d he answered.\n\nI nodded, for that was my own opinion, but replied,\n\n\u201cIf they were Zulus, the plan would be good. But how do we know that these men will stand?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know nothing, Macumazahn, and therefore can only try. If they run it must be up-hill.\u201d\n\nThen I called the captains and told them what was toward, which seemed to alarm them very much. Indeed one or two of them wanted to retreat at once, but I said I would shoot the first man who tried to do so. In the end they agreed to my plan and said that they would post their best soldiers above, at the top of the square, with the orders to stop any attempt at a flight up the mountain.\n\nAfter this we formed up the square as best we could, arranging it in a rather rough, four-fold line. While we were doing this we heard some shouts below and presently the Zulu returned, who reported that all was as Hans had said and that Rezu\u2019s men were moving round us, having discovered, as he thought, that we had halted and escaped their ambush.\n\nStill the attack did not develop at once, for the reason that the Rezu army was crawling up the steep flanks of the spur on either side of the level piece of ground, with a view of encircling us altogether, so as to make a clean sweep of our force. As a matter of fact, considered from our point of view, this was a most fortunate move, since thereby they stopped any attempt at a retreat on the part of our Amahagger, whose bolt-hole was now blocked.\n\nWhen we had done all we could, we sat down, or at least I did, and waited. The night, I remember, was strangely still, only from the slopes on either side of our plateau came a kind of rustling sound which in fact was caused by the feet of Rezu\u2019s people, as they marched to surround us.\n\nIt ceased at last and the silence grew complete, so much so that I could hear the teeth of some of our tall Amahagger chattering with fear, a sound that gave me little confidence and caused Umslopogaas to remark that the hearts of these big men had never grown; they remained \u201cas those of babies.\u201d I told the captains to pass the word down the ranks that those who stood might live, but those who fled would certainly die. Therefore if they wished to see their homes again they had better stand and fight like men. Otherwise most of them would be killed and the rest eaten by Rezu. This was done, and I observed that the message seemed to produce a steadying effect upon our ranks.\n\nSuddenly all around us, from below, from above and on either side there broke a most awful roar which seemed to shape itself into the word, _Rezu_, and next minute also from above, below and either side, some ten thousand men poured forth upon our square.\n\nIn the moonlight they looked very terrible with their flowing white robes and great gleaming spears. Hans and I fired some shots, though for all the effect they produced, we might as well have pelted a breaker with pebbles. Then, as I thought that I should be more useful alive than dead, I retreated within the square, Umslopogaas, his Zulu, and Hans coming with me.\n\nOn the whole our Amahagger stood the attack better than I expected. They beat back the first rush with considerable loss to the enemy, also the second after a longer struggle. Then there was a pause during which we re-formed our ranks, dragging the wounded men into the square.\n\nScarcely had we done this when with another mighty shout of \u201cRezu!\u201d the enemy attacked again\u2014that was about an hour after the battle had begun. But now they had changed their tactics, for instead of trying to rush all sides of the square at once, they concentrated their efforts on the western front, that which faced towards the plain below.\n\nOn they came, and among them in the forefront of the battle, now and again I caught sight of a gigantic man, a huge creature who seemed to me to be seven feet high and big in proportion. I could not see him clearly because of the uncertain moonlight, but I noted his fierce aspect, also that he had an enormous beard, black streaked with grey, that flowed down to his middle, and that his hair hung in masses upon his shoulders.\n\n\u201cRezu himself!\u201d I shouted to Umslopogaas.\n\n\u201cAye, Macumazahn, Rezu himself without doubt, and I rejoice to see him for he will be a worthy foe to fight. Look! he carries an axe as I do. Now I must save my strength for when we come face to face I shall need it all.\u201d\n\nI thought that I would spare Umslopogaas this exertion and watched my opportunity to put a bullet through this giant. But I could never get one. Once when I had covered him an Amahagger rushed in front of my gun so that I could not shoot, and when a second chance came a little cloud floated over the face of the moon and made him invisible. After that I had other things to which to attend, since, as I expected would happen, the western face of our square gave, and yelling like devils, the enemy began to pour in through the gap.",
    "At last we were on the plain, the bemused remnant of Rezu\u2019s army still doubling before us like a mob of game pursued by wild dogs. Here we halted to re-form our ranks; it seemed to me, although still she spoke no word, that some order reached me from the gleaming Ayesha that I should do this. The business took twenty minutes or so, and then, numbering about two thousand five hundred strong, for the rest had fallen in the fight of the square, we advanced again.\n\nNow there came that dusk which often precedes the rising of the sun, and through it I could see that the battle was not yet over, since gathered in front of us was still a force about equal to our own. Ayesha pointed towards it with her wand and we leapt forward to the attack. Here the men of Rezu stood awaiting us, for they seemed to overcome their terror with the approach of day.\n\nThe battle was fierce, a very strange battle in that dim, uncertain light, which scarcely showed us friend from foe. Indeed I am not sure that we should have won it, since Ayesha was no longer visible to give our Amahagger confidence, and as the courage of the Rezuites increased, so theirs seemed to lessen with the passing of the night.\n\nFortunately, however, just as the issue hung doubtful, there was a shout to our left and looking, I made out the tall shape of Goroko, the witch-doctor, with the other Zulu, followed by his two hundred and fifty men, and leaping on to the flank of the line of Rezu.\n\nThat settled the business. The enemy crumpled up and melted, and just then the first lights of dawn appeared in the sky. I looked about me for Ayesha, but she had gone, where to I knew not, though at the moment I feared that she must have been killed in the m\u00eal\u00e9e.\n\nThen I gave up looking and thinking, since now or never was the time for action. Signalling and shouting to those hatchet-faced Amahagger to advance, accompanied by Umslopogaas with Goroko who had joined us, and Hans, I sprang forward to give them an example, which, to be just to them, they took.\n\n\u201cThis is the mound on which Red-Beard should be,\u201d cried Hans as we faced a little slope.\n\nI ran up it and through the gloom which precedes the actual dawn, saw a group of men gathered round something, as people collect about a street accident.\n\n\u201cRed-Beard on the stone. They are killing him,\u201d screeched Hans again.\n\nIt was so; at least several white-robed priests were bending over a prostrate figure with knives in their hands, while behind stood the huge fellow whom I took to be Rezu, staring towards the east as though he were waiting for the rim of the sun to appear before he gave some order. At that very moment it did appear, just a thin edge of bright light on the horizon, and he turned, shouting the order.\n\nToo late! For we were on them. Umslopogaas cut down one of the priests with his axe, and the men about me dealt with the others, while Hans with a couple of sweeps of his long knife, severed the cords with which Robertson was tied.\n\nThe poor man who in the growing light I could see was raving mad, sprang up, calling out something in Scotch about \u201cthe deil.\u201d Seizing a great spear which had fallen from the hand of one of the priests, he rushed furiously at the giant who had given the order, and with a yell drove it at his heart. I saw the spear snap, from which I concluded that this man, whom rightly I took to be Rezu, wore some kind of armour.\n\nNext instant the axe he held, a great weapon, flashed aloft and down went Robertson before its awful stroke, stone dead, for as we found out afterwards, he was cloven almost in two. At the sight of the death of my poor friend rage took hold of me. In my hand was a double-barrelled rifle, an Express loaded with hollow-pointed bullets. I covered the giant and let drive, first with one barrel and then with the other, and what is more, distinctly I heard both bullets strike upon him.\n\nYet he did not fall. He rocked a little, that is all, then turned and marched off towards a hut, that whereof Hans had told me, which stood about fifty yards away.\n\n\u201cLeave him to me,\u201d shouted Umslopogaas. \u201cSteel cuts where bullets cannot pierce,\u201d and with a bound like to that of a buck, the great Zulu leapt away after him.\n\nI think that Rezu meant to enter the hut for some purpose of his own, but Umslopogaas was too hard upon his tracks. At any rate he ran past it and down the other slope of the little hill on to the plain behind where the remnants of his army were trying to re-form. There in front of them the giant turned and stood at bay.\n\nUmslopogaas halted also, waiting for us to come up, since, cunning old warrior as he was, he feared lest should he begin the fight before that happened, the horde of them would fall on him. Thirty seconds later we arrived and found him standing still with bent body, small shield advanced and the great axe raised as though in the act of striking, a wondrous picture outlined as it was against the swiftly rising-sun.",
    "Before turning in I examined these wounded men for myself. The truth is that I was anxious to learn their exact condition in order that I might make an estimate as to when it would be possible for us to leave this valley or crater bottom of K\u00f4r, of which I was heartily tired. Who could desire to stay in a place where he had not only been involved in a deal of hard, doubtful, and very dangerous fighting from which all personal interest was absent, but where also he was meshed in a perfect spider\u2019s web of bewilderment, and exposed to continual insult into the bargain?\n\nFor that is what it came to; this Ayesha took every opportunity to jeer at and affront me. And why? Just because I had conceived doubts, which somehow she discovered, of the amazing tales with which it had amused her to stuff me, as a farmer\u2019s wife does a turkey poult with meal pellets. How could she expect me, a man, after all, of some experience, to believe such lies, which, not half an hour before, in the coolest possible fashion she had herself admitted to be lies and nothing else, told for the mere pleasure of romancing?\n\nThe immortal Rezu, for instance, who had drunk of the Cup of Life or some such rubbish, now turned out to be nothing but a brawny savage descended from generations of chiefs also called Rezu. Moreover the immemorial Ayesha, who also had drunk of Cups of Life, and according to her first story, had lived in this place for thousands of years, had come here with a mother, who filled the same mystic r\u00f4le before her for the benefit of an extremely gloomy and disagreeable tribe of Semitic savages. Yet she was cross with me because I had not swallowed her crude and indigestible mixture of fable and philosophy without a moment\u2019s question.\n\nAt least I supposed that this was the reason, though another possible explanation did come into my mind. I had refused to be duly overcome by her charms, not because I was unimpressed, for who could be, having looked upon that blinding beauty even for a moment? but rather because, after sundry experiences, I had at last attained to some power of judgment and learned what it is best to leave alone. Perhaps this had annoyed her, especially as no white man seemed to have come her way for a long while and the fabulous Kallikrates had not put in his promised appearance.\n\nAlso it was unfortunate that in one way or another\u2014how did she do it, I wondered\u2014she had interpreted Umslopogaas\u2019 question to me about marrying her, and my compromising reply. Not that for one moment, as I saw very clearly, did she wish to marry me. But that fact, intuition suggested to my mind, did not the least prevent her from being angry because I shared her views upon this important subject.\n\nOh! the whole thing was a bore and the sooner I saw the last of that veiled lady and the interesting but wearisome ruins in which she dwelt, the better I should be pleased, although apparently I must trek homewards with a poor young woman who was out of her mind, leaving the bones of her unfortunate father behind me. I admitted to myself, however, that there were consolations in the fact that Providence had thus decreed, for Robertson since he gave up drink had not been a cheerful companion, and two mad people would really have been more than I could manage.\n\nTo return, for these reasons I examined the two wounded Zulus with considerable anxiety, only to discover another instance of the chicanery which it amused this Ayesha to play off upon me. For what did I find? That they were practically well. Their hurts, which had never been serious, had healed wonderfully in that pure air, as those of savages have a way of doing, and they told me themselves that they felt quite strong again. Yet with colossal impudence Ayesha had managed to suggest to my mind that she was going to work some remarkable cure upon them, who were already cured.\n\nWell, it was of a piece with the rest of her conduct and there was nothing to do except go to bed, which I did with much gratitude that my resting place that night was not of another sort. The last thing I remember was wondering how on earth Ayesha appeared and disappeared in the course of that battle, a problem as to which I could find no solution, though, as in the case of the others, I was sure that one would occur to me in course of time.\n\n\nI slept like a top, so soundly indeed that I think there was some kind of soporific in the pick-me-up which looked like sherry, especially as the others who had drunk of it also passed an excellent night.\n\n\nAbout ten o\u2019clock on the following morning I awoke feeling particularly well and quite as though I had been enjoying a week at the seaside instead of my recent adventures, which included an abominable battle and some agonising moments during which I thought that my number was up upon the board of Destiny.\n\n\nI spent the most of that day lounging about, eating, talking over the details of the battle with Umslopogaas and the Zulus and smoking more than usual. (I forgot to say that these Amahagger grew some capital tobacco of which I had obtained a supply, although like most Africans, they only used it in the shape of snuff.) The truth was that after all my marvellings and acute anxieties, also mental and physical exertions, I felt like the housemaid who caused to be cut upon her tombstone that she had gone to a better land where her ambition was to do nothing \u201cfor ever and ever.\u201d I just wanted to be completely idle and vacuous-minded for at least a month, but as I knew that all I could expect in that line was a single bank holiday, like a City clerk on the spree, of it I determined to make the most.\n\n\nThe result was that before the evening I felt very bored indeed. I had gone to look at Inez, who was still fast asleep, as Ayesha said would be the case, but whose features seemed to have plumped up considerably. The reason of this I gathered from her Amahagger nurses, was that at certain intervals she had awakened sufficiently to swallow considerable quantities of milk, or rather cream, which I hoped would not make her ill. I had chatted with the wounded Zulus, who were now walking about, more bored even than I was myself, and heaping maledictions on their ancestral spirits because they had not been well enough to take part in the battle against Rezu.\n\n\nI even took a little stroll to look for Hans, who had vanished in his mysterious fashion, but the afternoon was so hot and oppressive with coming thunder, that soon I came back again and fell into a variety of reflections that I need not detail.\n\n\nWhile I was thus engaged and meditating, not without uneasiness, upon the ordeal that lay before me after sunset, for I felt sure that it would be an ordeal, Hans appeared and said that the Amahagger _impi_ or army was gathered on that spot where I had been elected to the proud position of their General. He added that he believed\u2014how he got this information I do not know\u2014that the White Lady was going to hold a review of them and give them the rewards that they had earned in the battle.\n\n\nHearing this, Umslopogaas and the other Zulus said that they would like to see this review if I would accompany them. Although I did not want to go nor indeed desired ever to look at another Amahagger, I consented to save the trouble of argument, on condition that we should do so from a distance.\n\n\nSo, including the wounded men, we strolled off and presently came to the crumbled wall of the old city, beyond which lay the great moat now dry, that once had encircled it with water.\n\n\nHere on the top of this wall we sat down where we could see without being seen, and observed the Amahagger companies, considerably reduced during the battle, being marshalled by their captains beneath us and about a couple of hundred yards away. Also we observed several groups of men under guard. These we took to be prisoners captured in the fight with Rezu, who, as Hans remarked with a smack of his lips, were probably awaiting sacrifice.",
    "\u201cYes,\u201d answered Ayesha, laughing very softly, \u201cfor that purpose alone, O truth-seeking Allan, whose curiosity is so fierce that the wide world cannot hold it, did you come to K\u00f4r and not to seek wealth or new lands, or to fight more savages. No, not even to look upon a certain Ayesha, of whom the old wizard told you, though I think you have always loved to try to lift the veil that hides women\u2019s hearts, if not their faces. Yet it was I who brought you to K\u00f4r for my own purposes, not your desire, nor Zikali\u2019s map and talisman, since had not the white lady who lies sick been stolen by Rezu, never would you have pursued the journey nor found the way hither.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could you have had anything to do with that business?\u201d I asked testily, for my nerves were on edge and I said the first thing that came into my mind.\n\n\u201cThat, Allan, is a question over which you will wonder for a long while either beneath or beyond the sun, as you will wonder concerning much that has to do with me, which your little mind, shut in its iron box of ignorance and pride, cannot understand to-day.\n\nFor example, you have been wondering, I am sure, how the lightning killed those eleven men whose bodies you went to look on an hour or two ago, and left the rest untouched. Well, I will tell you at once that it was not lightning that killed them, although the strength within me was manifest to you in storm, but rather what that witch-doctor of your following called wizardry. Because they were traitors who betrayed your army to Rezu, I killed them with my wrath and by the wand of my power. Oh! you do not believe, yet perhaps ere long you will, since thus to fulfil your prayer I must also kill you\u2014almost. That is the trouble, Allan. To kill you outright would be easy, but to kill you just enough to set your spirit free and yet leave one crevice of mortal life through which it can creep back again, that is most difficult; a thing that only I can do and even of myself I am not sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray do not try the experiment\u2014\u2014\u201d I began thoroughly alarmed, but she cut me short.\n\n\u201cDisturb me no more, Allan, with the tremors and changes of your uncertain mind, lest you should work more evil than you think, and making mine uncertain also, spoil my skill. Nay, do not try to fly, for already the net has thrown itself about you and you cannot stir, who are bound like a little gilded wasp in the spider\u2019s web, or like birds beneath the eyes of basilisks.\u201d\n\nThis was true, for I found that, strive as I would, I could not move a limb or even an eyelid. I was frozen to that spot and there was nothing for it except to curse my folly and say my prayers.\n\nAll this while she went on talking, but of what she said I have not the faintest idea, because my remaining wits were absorbed in these much-needed implorations.\n\nPresently, of a sudden, I appeared to see Ayesha seated in a temple, for there were columns about her, and behind her was an altar on which a fire burned. All round her, too, were hooded snakes like to that which she wore about her middle, fashioned in gold. To these snakes she sang and they danced to her singing; yes, with flickering tongues they danced upon their tails! What the scene signified I cannot conceive, unless it meant that this mistress of magic was consulting her familiars.\n\nThen that vision vanished and Ayesha\u2019s voice began to seem very far away and dreamy, also her wondrous beauty became visible to me through her veil, as though I had acquired a new sense that overcame the limitations of mortal sight. Even in this extremity I reflected it was well that the last thing I looked on should be something so glorious. No, not quite the last thing, for out of the corners of my eyes I saw that Umslopogaas from a sitting position had sunk on to his back and lay, apparently dead, with his axe still gripped tightly and held above his head, as though his arm had been turned to ice.\n\nAfter this terrible things began to happen to me and I became aware that I was dying. A great wind seemed to catch me up and blow me to and fro, as a leaf is blown in the eddies of a winter gale. Enormous rushes of darkness flowed over me, to be succeeded by vivid bursts of brightness that dazzled like lightning. I fell off precipices and at the foot of them was caught by some fearful strength and tossed to the very skies.\n\nFrom those skies I was hurled down again into a kind of whirlpool of inky night, round which I spun perpetually, as it seemed for hours and hours. But worst of all was the awful loneliness from which I suffered. It seemed to me as though there were no other living thing in all the Universe and never had been and never would be any other living thing. I felt as though _I_ were the Universe rushing solitary through space for ages upon ages in a frantic search for fellowship, and finding none.\n\nThen something seemed to grip my throat and I knew that I had died\u2014for the world floated away from beneath me.\n\nNow fear and every mortal sensation left me, to be replaced by a new and spiritual terror. I, or rather my disembodied consciousness, seemed to come up for judgment, and the horror of it was that I appeared to be my own judge. There, a very embodiment of cold justice, my Spirit, grown luminous, sat upon a throne and to it, with dread and merciless particularity I set out all my misdeeds. It was as if some part of me remained mortal, for I could see my two eyes, my mouth and my hands, but nothing else\u2014and strange enough they looked. From the eyes came tears, from the mouth flowed words and the hands were joined, as though in prayer to that throned and adamantine Spirit which was ME.\n\nIt was as though this Spirit were asking how my body had served its purposes and advanced its mighty ends, and in reply\u2014oh! what a miserable tale I had to tell. Fault upon fault, weakness upon weakness, sin upon sin; never before did I understand how black was my record. I tried to relieve the picture with some incidents of attempted good, but that Spirit would not hearken. It seemed to say that it had gathered up the good and knew it all. It was of the evil that it would learn, not of the good that had bettered it, but of the evil by which it had been harmed.\n\nHearing this there rose up in my consciousness some memory of what Ayesha had said; namely, that the body lived within the temple of the spirit which is oft defied, and not the spirit in the body.\n\nThe story was told and I hearkened for the judgment, my own judgment on myself, which I knew would be accepted without question and registered for good or ill. But none came, since ere the balance sank this way or that, ere it could be uttered, I was swept afar.\n\nThrough Infinity I was swept, and as I fled faster than the light, the meaning of what I had seen came home to me. I knew, or seemed to know for the first time, that at the last _man must answer to himself_, or perhaps to a divine principle within himself, that out of his own free-will, through long \u00e6ons and by a million steps, he climbs or sinks to the heights or depths dormant in his nature; that from what he was, springs what he is, and what he is, engenders what he shall be for ever and aye.\n\nNow I envisaged Immortality and splendid and awful was its face. It clasped me to its breast and in the vast circle of its arms I was up-borne, I who knew myself to be without beginning and without end, and yet of the past and of the future knew nothing, save that these were full of mysteries.",
    "\u201cDid you make a journey this evening, Macumazahn, and if so, what did you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you have a dream this evening, Umslopogaas?\u201d I inquired by way of answer, \u201cand if so, what was it about? I thought that I saw you shut your eyes in the House of the White One yonder, doubtless because you were weary of talk which you did not understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, Macumazahn, as you suppose I grew weary of that talk which flowed from the lips of the White Witch like the music that comes from a little stream babbling over stones when the sun is hot, and being weary, I fell asleep and dreamed. What I dreamed does not much matter. It is enough to say that I felt as though I were thrown through the air like a stone cast from his sling by a boy who is set upon a stage to scare the birds out of a mealie garden. Further than any stone I went, aye, further than a shooting star, till I reached a wonderful place. It does not much matter what it was like either, and indeed I am already beginning to forget, but there I met everyone I have ever known. I met the Lion of the Zulus, the Black One, the Earth-Shaker, he who had a \u2018sister\u2019 named Baleka, which sister,\u201d here he dropped his voice and looked about him suspiciously, \u201cbore a child, which child was fostered by one Mopo, that Mopo who afterwards slew the Black one with the Princes. Now, Macumazahn, I had a score to settle with this Black One, aye, even though our blood be much of the same colour, I had a score to settle with him, because of the slaying of this sister of his, Baleka, together with the Langeni tribe.[1] So I walked up to him and took him by the head-ring and spat in his face and bade him find a spear and shield, and meet me as man to man. Yes, I did this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what happened then, Umslopogaas?\u201d I said, when he paused in his narrative.\n\n\u201cMacumazahn, nothing happened at all. My hand seemed to go through his head-ring and the skull beneath, and to shut upon itself while he went on talking to someone else, a captain whom I recognised, yes, one Faku, whom in the days of Dingaan, the Black One\u2019s brother, I myself slew upon the Ghost-Mountain.\n\nYes, Macumazahn, and Faku was telling him the tale of how I killed him and of the fight that I and my blood-brother and the wolves made, there on the knees of the old witch who sits aloft on the Ghost Mountain waiting for the world to die, for I could understand their talk, though mine went by them like the wind.\n\nThey passed away and there came others, Dingaan among them, aye, Dingaan who also knows something of the Witch-Mountain, seeing that there Mopo and I hurled him to his death. With him also I would have had words, but it was the same story, only presently he caught sight of the Black One, yes, of Chaka whom he slew, stabbing him with the little red assegai, and turned and fled, because in that land I think he still fears Chaka, Macumazahn, or so the dream told.\n\nI went on and met others, men I had fought in my day, most of them, among them was Jikiza, he who ruled the People of the Axe before me whom I slew with his own axe. I lifted the axe and made me ready to fight again, but not one of them took any note of me. There they walked about, or sat drinking beer or taking snuff, but never a sup of the beer or a pinch of the snuff did they offer me, no, not even those among them whom I chanced not to have killed. So I left them and walked on, seeking for Mopo, my foster-father, and a certain man, my blood-brother, by whose side I hunted with the wolves, yes, for them, and for another.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, and did you find them?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cMopo I found not, which makes me think, Macumazahn, that, as once you hinted to me, he whom I thought long dead, perchance still lingers on the earth. But the others I did find . . .\u201d and he ceased, brooding.\n\nNow I knew enough of Umslopogaas\u2019s history to be aware that he had loved this man and woman of whom he spoke more than any others on the earth. The \u201cblood-brother,\u201d whose name he would not utter, by which he did not mean that he was his brother in blood but one with whom he had made a pact of eternal friendship by the interchange of blood or some such ceremony, according to report, had dwelt with him on the Witch-Mountain where legend told, though this I could scarcely believe, that they had hunted with a pack of hyenas. There, it said also, they fought a great fight with a band send out by Dingaan the king under the command of that Faku whom Umslopogaas had mentioned, in which fight the \u201cBlood-Brother,\u201d wielder of a famous club known as Watcher-of-the-Fords, got his death after doing mighty deeds. There also, as I had heard, Nada the Lily, whose beauty was still famous in the land, died under circumstances strange as they were sad.\n\nNaturally, remembering my own experiences, or rather what seemed to be my experiences, for already I had made up my mind that they were but a dream, I was most anxious to learn whether these two who had been so dear to this fierce Zulu, had recognised him.\n\n\u201cWell, and what did they say to you, Umslopogaas?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cMacumazahn, they said nothing at all. Hearken! There stood this pair, or sometimes they moved to and fro; my brother, an even greater man than he used to be, with the wolfskin girt about him and the club, Watcher-of-the-Fords, which he alone could wield, upon his shoulder, and Nada, grown lovelier even than she was of old, so lovely, Macumazahn, that my heart rose into my throat when I saw her and stopped my breath. Yes, Macumazahn, there they stood, or walked about arm in arm as lovers might, and looked into each other\u2019s eyes and talked of how they had known each other on the earth, for I could understand their words or thoughts, and how it was good to be at rest together where they were.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, they were old friends, Umslopogaas,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes, Macumazahn, very old friends as I thought. So much so that they had never had a word to say of me who also was the old friend of both of them. Aye, my brother, whose name I am sworn not to speak, the woman-hater who vowed he loved nothing save me and the wolves, could smile into the face of Nada the Lily, Nada the bride of my youth, yet never a word of me, while she could smile back and tell him how great a warrior he had been and never a word of me whose deeds she was wont to praise, who saved her in the Halakazi caves and from Dingaan; no, never a word of me although I stood there staring at them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose that they did not see you, Umslopogaas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is so, Macumazahn; I am sure that they did not see me, for if they had they would not have been so much at ease. But I saw them and as they would not take heed when I shouted, I ran up calling to my brother to defend himself with his club. Then, as he still took no note, I lifted the axe _Inkosikaas_, making it circle in the light, and smote with all my strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what happened, Umslopogaas?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly this, Macumazahn, that the axe went straight through my brother from the crown of his head to the groin, cutting him in two, and he just went on talking! Indeed, he did more, for stooping down he gathered a white lily-bloom which grew there and gave it to Nada, who smelt at it, smiled and thanked him, and then thrust it into her girdle, still thanking him all the while. Yes, she did this for I saw it with my eyes, Macumazahn.\u201d\n\nHere the Zulu\u2019s voice broke and I think that he wept, for in the faint light I saw him draw his long hand across his eyes, whereon I took the opportunity to turn my back and light a pipe."

  "John Meade Falkner -- Moonfleet": [
    "The village of Moonfleet lies half a mile from the sea on the right or west bank of the Fleet stream. This rivulet, which is so narrow as it passes the houses that I have known a good jumper clear it without a pole, broadens out into salt marshes below the village, and loses itself at last in a lake of brackish water. The lake is good for nothing except sea-fowl, herons, and oysters, and forms such a place as they call in the Indies a lagoon; being shut off from the open Channel by a monstrous great beach or dike of pebbles, of which I shall speak more hereafter. When I was a child I thought that this place was called Moonfleet, because on a still night, whether in summer, or in winter frosts, the moon shone very brightly on the lagoon; but learned afterwards that 'twas but short for 'Mohune-fleet', from the Mohunes, a great family who were once lords of all these parts.\n\nMy name is John Trenchard, and I was fifteen years of age when this story begins. My father and mother had both been dead for years, and I boarded with my aunt, Miss Arnold, who was kind to me in her own fashion, but too strict and precise ever to make me love her.\n\nI shall first speak of one evening in the fall of the year 1757. It must have been late in October, though I have forgotten the exact date, and I sat in the little front parlour reading after tea. My aunt had few books; a Bible, a Common Prayer, and some volumes of sermons are all that I can recollect now; but the Reverend Mr. Glennie, who taught us village children, had lent me a story-book, full of interest and adventure, called the _Arabian Nights Entertainment_. At last the light began to fail, and I was nothing loth to leave off reading for several reasons; as, first, the parlour was a chilly room with horse-hair chairs and sofa, and only a coloured-paper screen in the grate, for my aunt did not allow a fire till the first of November; second, there was a rank smell of molten tallow in the house, for my aunt was dipping winter candles on frames in the back kitchen; third, I had reached a part in the _Arabian Nights_ which tightened my breath and made me wish to leave off reading for very anxiousness of expectation. It was that point in the story of the 'Wonderful Lamp', where the false uncle lets fall a stone that seals the mouth of the underground chamber; and immures the boy, Aladdin, in the darkness, because he would not give up the lamp till he stood safe on the surface again. This scene reminded me of one of those dreadful nightmares, where we dream we are shut in a little room, the walls of which are closing in upon us, and so impressed me that the memory of it served as a warning in an adventure that befell me later on. So I gave up reading and stepped out into the street.\n\nIt was a poor street at best, though once, no doubt, it had been finer. Now, there were not two hundred souls in Moonfleet, and yet the houses that held them straggled sadly over half a mile, lying at intervals along either side of the road. Nothing was ever made new in the village; if a house wanted repair badly, it was pulled down, and so there were toothless gaps in the street, and overrun gardens with broken-down walls, and many of the houses that yet stood looked as though they could stand but little longer.\n\nThe sun had set; indeed, it was already so dusk that the lower or sea-end of the street was lost from sight. There was a little fog or smoke-wreath in the air, with an odour of burning weeds, and that first frosty feeling of the autumn that makes us think of glowing fires and the comfort of long winter evenings to come. All was very still, but I could hear the tapping of a hammer farther down the street, and walked to see what was doing, for we had no trades in Moonfleet save that of fishing. It was Ratsey the sexton at work in a shed which opened on the street, lettering a tombstone with a mallet and graver. He had been mason before he became fisherman, and was handy with his tools; so that if anyone wanted a headstone set up in the churchyard, he went to Ratsey to get it done. I lent over the half-door and watched him a minute, chipping away with the graver in a bad light from a lantern; then he looked up, and seeing me, said:\n\n'Here, John, if you have nothing to do, come in and hold the lantern for me, 'tis but a half-hour's job to get all finished.'\n\nRatsey was always kind to me, and had lent me a chisel many a time to make boats, so I stepped in and held the lantern watching him chink out the bits of Portland stone with a graver, and blinking the while when they came too near my eyes. The inscription stood complete, but he was putting the finishing touches to a little sea-piece carved at the top of the stone, which showed a schooner boarding a cutter. I thought it fine work at the time, but know now that it was rough enough; indeed, you may see it for yourself in Moonfleet churchyard to this day, and read the inscription too, though it is yellow with lichen, and not so plain as it was that night. This is how it runs:\n\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF DAVID BLOCK\n\nAged 15, who was killed by a shot fired from the _Elector_ Schooner, 21 June 1757.\n\nOf life bereft (by fell design),\n  I mingle with my fellow clay.\nOn God's protection I recline\n  To save me in the Judgement Day.\n\nThere too must you, cruel man, appear,\n  Repent ere it be all too late;\nOr else a dreadful sentence fear,\n  For God will sure revenge my fate.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Glennie wrote the verses, and I knew them by heart, for he had given me a copy; indeed, the whole village had rung with the tale of David's death, and it was yet in every mouth. He was only child to Elzevir Block, who kept the Why Not? inn at the bottom of the village, and was with the contrabandiers, when their ketch was boarded that June night by the Government schooner. People said that it was Magistrate Maskew of Moonfleet Manor who had put the Revenue men on the track, and anyway he was on board the _Elector_ as she overhauled the ketch. There was some show of fighting when the vessels first came alongside of one another, and Maskew drew a pistol and fired it off in young David's face, with only the two gunwales between them. In the afternoon of Midsummer's Day the _Elector_ brought the ketch into Moonfleet, and there was a posse of constables to march the smugglers off to Dorchester Jail. The prisoners trudged up through the village ironed two and two together, while people stood at their doors or followed them, the men greeting them with a kindly word, for we knew most of them as Ringstave and Monkbury men, and the women sorrowing for their wives. But they left David's body in the ketch, so the boy paid dear for his night's frolic.\n\n\n'Ay, 'twas a cruel, cruel thing to fire on so young a lad,' Ratsey said, as he stepped back a pace to study the effect of a flag that he was chiselling on the Revenue schooner, 'and trouble is likely to come to the other poor fellows taken, for Lawyer Empson says three of them will surely hang at next Assize. I recollect', he went on, 'thirty years ago, when there was a bit of a scuffle between the _Royal Sophy_ and the _Marnhull_, they hanged four of the contrabandiers, and my old father caught his death of cold what with going to see the poor chaps turned off at Dorchester, and standing up to his knees in the river Frome to get a sight of them, for all the countryside was there, and such a press there was no place on land. There, that's enough,' he said, turning again to the gravestone. 'On Monday I'll line the ports in black, and get a brush of red to pick out the flag; and now, my son, you've helped with the lantern, so come down to the Why Not? and there I'll have a word with Elzevir, who sadly needs the talk of kindly friends to cheer him, and we'll find you a glass of Hollands to keep out autumn chills.'\n\n\nI was but a lad, and thought it a vast honour to be asked to the Why Not?--for did not such an invitation raise me at once to the dignity of manhood. Ah, sweet boyhood, how eager are we as boys to be quit of thee, with what regret do we look back on thee before our man's race is half-way run! Yet was not my pleasure without alloy, for I feared even to think of what Aunt Jane would say if she knew that I had been at the Why Not?--and beside that, I stood in awe of grim old Elzevir Block, grimmer and sadder a thousand times since David's death.",
    "It must have been past four o'clock in the afternoon, and I was for returning to tea at my aunt's, when underneath the stone on which I sat I heard a rumbling and crumbling, and on jumping off saw that the crack in the ground had still further widened, just where it came up to the tomb, and that the dry earth had so shrunk and settled that there was a hole in the ground a foot or more across. Now this hole reached under the big stone that formed one side of the tomb, and falling on my hands and knees and looking down it, I perceived that there was under the monument a larger cavity, into which the hole opened. I believe there never was boy yet who saw a hole in the ground, or a cave in a hill, or much more an underground passage, but longed incontinently to be into it and discover whither it led. So it was with me; and seeing that the earth had fallen enough into the hole to open a way under the stone, I slipped myself in feet foremost, dropped down on to a heap of fallen mould, and found that I could stand upright under the monument itself.\n\nNow this was what I had expected, for I thought that there had been below this grave a vault, the roof of which had given way and let the earth fall in. But as soon as my eyes were used to the dimmer light, I saw that it was no such thing, but that the hole into which I had crept was only the mouth of a passage, which sloped gently down in the direction of the church. My heart fell to thumping with eagerness and surprise, for I thought I had made a wonderful discovery, and that this hidden way would certainly lead to great things, perhaps even to Blackbeard's hoard; for ever since Mr. Glennie's tale I had constantly before my eyes a vision of the diamond and the wealth it was to bring me. The passage was two paces broad, as high as a tall man, and cut through the soil, without bricks or any other lining; and what surprised me most was that it did not seem deserted nor mouldy and cob-webbed, as one would expect such a place to be, but rather a well-used thoroughfare; for I could see the soft clay floor was trodden with the prints of many boots, and marked with a trail as if some heavy thing had been dragged over it.\n\nSo I set out down the passage, reaching out my hand before me lest I should run against anything in the dark, and sliding my feet slowly to avoid pitfalls in the floor. But before I had gone half a dozen paces, the darkness grew so black that I was frightened, and so far from going on was glad to turn sharp about, and see the glimmer of light that came in through the hole under the tomb. Then a horror of the darkness seized me, and before I well knew what I was about I found myself wriggling my body up under the tombstone on to the churchyard grass, and was once more in the low evening sunlight and the soft sweet air.\n\nHome I ran to my aunt's, for it was past tea-time, and beside that I knew I must fetch a candle if I were ever to search out the passage; and to search it I had well made up my mind, no matter how much I was scared for this moment. My aunt gave me but a sorry greeting when I came into the kitchen, for I was late and hot. She never said much when displeased, but had a way of saying nothing, which was much worse; and would only reply yes or no, and that after an interval, to anything that was asked of her. So the meal was silent enough, for she had finished before I arrived, and I ate but little myself being too much occupied with the thought of my strange discovery, and finding, beside, the tea lukewarm and the victuals not enticing.\n\nYou may guess that I said nothing of what I had seen, but made up my mind that as soon as my aunt's back was turned I would get a candle and tinder-box, and return to the churchyard. The sun was down before Aunt Jane gave thanks for what we had received, and then, turning to me, she said in a cold and measured voice:\n\n'John, I have observed that you are often out and about of nights, sometimes as late as half past seven or eight. Now, it is not seemly for young folk to be abroad after dark, and I do not choose that my nephew should be called a gadabout. \"What's bred in the bone will come out in the flesh\", and 'twas with such loafing that your father began his wild ways, and afterwards led my poor sister such a life as never was, till the mercy of Providence took him away.'\n\nAunt Jane often spoke thus of my father, whom I never remembered, but believe him to have been an honest man and good fellow to boot, if something given to roaming and to the contraband.\n\n'So understand', she went on, 'that I will not have you out again this evening, no, nor any other evening, after dusk. Bed is the place for youth when night falls, but if this seem to you too early you can sit with me for an hour in the parlour, and I will read you a discourse of Doctor Sherlock that will banish vain thoughts, and leave you in a fit frame for quiet sleep.'\n\nSo she led the way into the parlour, took the book from the shelf, put it on the table within the little circle of light cast by a shaded candle, and began. It was dull enough, though I had borne such tribulations before, and the drone of my aunt's voice would have sent me to sleep, as it had done at other times, even in a straight-backed chair, had I not been so full of my discovery, and chafed at this delay. Thus all the time my aunt read of spiritualities and saving grace, I had my mind on diamonds and all kinds of mammon, for I never doubted that Blackbeard's treasure would be found at the end of that secret passage. The sermon finished at last, and my aunt closed the book with a stiff 'good night' for me. I was for giving her my formal kiss, but she made as if she did not see me and turned away; so we went upstairs each to our own room, and I never kissed Aunt Jane again.\n\nThere was a moon three-quarters full, already in the sky, and on moonlight nights I was allowed no candle to show me to bed. But on that night I needed none, for I never took off my clothes, having resolved to wait till my aunt was asleep, and then, ghosts or no ghosts, to make my way back to the churchyard. I did not dare to put off that visit even till the morning, lest some chance passer-by should light upon the hole, and so forestall me with Blackbeard's treasure.\n\nThus I lay wide awake on my bed watching the shadow of the tester-post against the whitewashed wall, and noting how it had moved, by degrees, as the moon went farther round. At last, just as it touched the picture of the Good Shepherd which hung over the mantelpiece, I heard my aunt snoring in her room, and knew that I was free. Yet I waited a few minutes so that she might get well on with her first sleep, and then took off my boots, and in stockinged feet slipped past her room and down the stairs. How stair, handrail, and landing creaked that night, and how my feet and body struck noisily against things seen quite well but misjudged in the effort not to misjudge them! And yet there was the note of safety still sounding, for the snoring never ceased, and the sleeper woke not, though her waking then might have changed all my life. So I came safely to the kitchen, and there put in my pocket one of the best winter candles and the tinder-box, and as I crept out of the room heard suddenly how loud the old clock was ticking, and looking up saw the bright brass band marking half past ten on the dial.\n\nOut in the street I kept in the shadow of the houses as far as I might, though all was silent as the grave; indeed, I think that when the moon is bright a great hush falls always upon Nature, as though she was taken up in wondering at her own beauty. Everyone was fast asleep in Moonfleet and there was no light in any window; only when I came opposite the Why Not? I saw from the red glow behind the curtains that the bottom room was lit up, so Elzevir was not yet gone to bed. It was strange, for the Why Not? had been shut up early for many a long night past, and I crossed over cautiously to see if I could make out what was going forward. But that was not to be done, for the panes were thickly steamed over; and this surprised me more as showing that there was a good company inside. Moreover, as I stood and listened I could hear a mutter of deep voices inside, not as of roisterers, but of sober men talking low.\n\nEagerness would not let me wait long, and I was off across the meadows towards the church, though not without sad misgivings as soon as the last house was left well behind me. At the churchyard wall my courage had waned somewhat: it seemed a shameless thing to come to rifle Blackbeard's treasure just in the very place and hour that Blackbeard loved; and as I passed the turnstile I half-expected that a tall figure, hairy and evil-eyed, would spring out from the shadow on the north side of the church. But nothing stirred, and the frosty grass sounded crisp under my feet as I made across the churchyard, stepping over the graves and keeping always out of the shadows, towards the black clump of yew-trees on the far side.\n\nWhen I got round the yews, there was the tomb standing out white against them, and at the foot of the tomb was the hole like a patch of black velvet spread upon the ground, it was so dark. Then, for a moment, I thought that Blackbeard might be lying in wait in the bottom of the hole, and I stood uncertain whether to go on or back. I could catch the rustle of the water on the beach--not of any waves, for the bay was smooth as glass, but just a lipper at the fringe; and wishing to put off with any excuse the descent into the passage, though I had quite resolved to make it, I settled with myself that I would count the water wash twenty times, and at the twentieth would let myself down into the hole. Only seven wavelets had come in when I forgot to count, for there, right in the middle of the moon's path across the water, lay a lugger moored broadside to the beach. She was about half a mile out, but there was no mistake, for though her sails were lowered her masts and hull stood out black against the moonlight. Here was a fresh reason for delay, for surely one must consider what this craft could be, and what had brought her here. She was too small for a privateer, too large for a fishing-smack, and could not be a revenue boat by her low freeboard in the waist; and 'twas a strange thing for a boat to cast anchor in the midst of Moonfleet Bay even on a night so fine as this. Then while I watched I saw a blue flare in the bows, only for a moment, as if a man had lit a squib and flung it overboard, but I knew from it she was a contrabandier, and signalling either to the shore or to a mate in the offing. With that, courage came back, and I resolved to make this flare my signal for getting down into the hole, screwing my heart up with the thought that if Blackbeard was really waiting for me there, 'twould be little good to turn tail now, for he would be after me and could certainly run much faster than I. Then I took one last look round, and down into the hole forthwith, the same way as I had got down earlier in the day. So on that February night John Trenchard found himself standing in the heap of loose fallen mould at the bottom of the hole, with a mixture of courage and cowardice in his heart, but overruling all a great desire to get at Blackbeard's diamond.\n\nOut came tinder-box and candle, and I was glad indeed when the light burned up bright enough to show that no one, at any rate, was standing by my side. But then there was the passage, and who could say what might be lurking there? Yet I did not falter, but set out on this adventurous journey, walking very slowly indeed--but that was from fear of pitfalls--and nerving myself with the thought of the great diamond which surely would be found at the end of the passage. What should I not be able to do with such wealth? I would buy a nag for Mr. Glennie, a new boat for Ratsey, and a silk gown for Aunt Jane, in spite of her being so hard with me as on this night. And thus I would make myself the greatest man in Moonfleet, richer even than Mr. Maskew, and build a stone house in the sea-meadows with a good prospect of the sea, and marry Grace Maskew and live happily, and fish. I walked on down the passage, reaching out the candle as far as might be in front of me, and whistling to keep myself company, yet saw neither Blackbeard nor anyone else. All the way there were footprints on the floor, and the roof was black as with smoke of torches, and this made me fear lest some of those who had been there before might have made away with the diamond. Now, though I have spoken of this journey down the passage as though it were a mile long, and though it verily seemed so to me that night, yet I afterwards found it was not more than twenty yards or thereabouts; and then I came upon a stone wall which had once blocked the road, but was now broken through so as to make a ragged doorway into a chamber beyond. There I stood on the rough sill of the door, holding my breath and reaching out my candle arm's-length into the darkness, to see what sort of a place this was before I put foot into it. And before the light had well time to fall on things, I knew that I was underneath the church, and that this chamber was none other than the Mohune Vault.\n\n\nIt was a large room, much larger, I think, than the schoolroom where Mr. Glennie taught us, but not near so high, being only some nine feet from floor to roof. I say floor, though in reality there was none, but only a bottom of soft wet sand; and when I stepped down on to it my heart beat very fiercely, for I remembered what manner of place I was entering, and the dreadful sounds which had issued from it that Sunday morning so short a time before. I satisfied myself that there was nothing evil lurking in the dark corners, or nothing visible at least, and then began to look round and note what was to be seen. Walls and roof were stone, and at one end was a staircase closed by a great flat stone at top--that same stone which I had often seen, with a ring in it, in the floor of the church above. All round the sides were stone shelves, with divisions between them like great bookcases, but instead of books there were the coffins of the Mohunes. Yet these lay only at the sides, and in the middle of the room was something very different, for here were stacked scores of casks, kegs, and runlets, from a storage butt that might hold thirty gallons down to a breaker that held only one. They were marked all of them in white paint on the end with figures and letters, that doubtless set forth the quality to those that understood. Here indeed was a discovery, and instead of picking up at the end of the passage a little brass or silver casket, which had only to be opened to show Blackbeard's diamond gleaming inside, I had stumbled on the Mohunes' vault, and found it to be nothing but a cellar of gentlemen of the contraband, for surely good liquor would never be stored in so shy a place if it ever had paid the excise.",
    "Though nothing of the vault except the roof was visible from where I lay, and so I could not see these visitors, yet I heard every word spoken, and soon made out one voice as being Master Ratsey's. This discovery gave me no surprise but much solace, for I thought that if the worst happened and I was discovered, I should find one friend with whom I could plead for life.\n\n'It is well the earth gave way', the sexton was saying, 'on a night when we were here to find it. I was in the graveyard myself after midday, and all was snug and tight then. 'Twould have been awkward enough to have the hole stand open through the day, for any passer-by to light on.'\n\nThere were four or five men in the vault already, and I could hear more coming down the passage, and guessed from their heavy footsteps that they were carrying burdens. There was a sound, too, of dumping kegs down on the ground, with a swish of liquor inside them, and then the noise of casks being moved.\n\n'I thought we should have a fall there ere long,' Ratsey went on, 'what with this drought parching the ground, and the trampling at the edge when we move out the side stone to get in, but there is no mischief done beyond what can be easily made good. A gravestone or two and a few spades of earth will make all sound again. Leave that to me.'\n\n'Be careful what you do,' rejoined another man's voice that I did not know, 'lest someone see you digging, and scent us out.'\n\n'Make your mind easy,' Ratsey said; 'I have dug too often in this graveyard for any to wonder if they see me with a spade.'\n\nThen the conversation broke off, and there was little more talking, only a noise of men going backwards and forwards, and of putting down of kegs and the hollow gurgle of good liquor being poured from breakers into the casks. By and by fumes of brandy began to fill the air, and climb to where I lay, overcoming the mouldy smell of decayed wood and the dampness of the green walls. It may have been that these fumes mounted to my head, and gave me courage not my own, but so it was that I lost something of the stifling fear that had gripped me, and could listen with more ease to what was going forward. There was a pause in the carrying to and fro; they were talking again now, and someone said--\n\n'I was in Dorchester three days ago, and heard men say it will go hard with the poor chaps who had the brush with the _Elector_ last summer. Judge Barentyne comes on Assize next week, and that old fox Maskew has driven down to Taunton to get at him before and coach him back; making out to him that the Law's arm is weak in these parts against the contraband, and must be strengthened by some wholesome hangings.'\n\n'They are a cruel pair,' another put in, 'and we shall have new gibbets on Ridgedown for leading lights. Once I get even with Maskew, the other may go hang, ay, and they may hang me too.'\n\n'The Devil send him to meet me one dark night on the down alone,' said someone else, 'and I will give him a pistol's mouth to look down, and spoil his face for him.'\n\n'No, thou wilt not,' said a deep voice, and then I knew that Elzevir was there too; 'none shall lay hand on Maskew but I. So mark that, lad, that when his day of reckoning comes, 'tis _I_ will reckon with him.'\n\nThen for a few minutes I did not pay much heed to what was said, being terribly straitened for room, and cramped with pain from lying so long in one place. The thick smoke from the pitch torches too came curling across the roof and down upon me, making me sick and giddy with its evil smell and taste; and though all was very dim, I could see my hands were black with oily smuts. At last I was able to wriggle myself over without making too much noise, and felt a great relief in changing sides, but gave such a start as made the coffin creak again at hearing my own name.\n\n'There is a boy of Trenchard's,' said a voice that I thought was Parmiter's, who lived at the bottom of the village--'there is a boy of Trenchard's that I mistrust; he is for ever wandering in the graveyard, and I have seen him a score of times sitting on this tomb and looking out to sea. This very night, when the wind fell at sundown, and we were hung up with sails flapping, three miles out, and waited for the dark to get the sweeps, I took my glass to scan the coast-line, and lo, here on the tomb-top sits Master Trenchard. I could not see his face, but knew him by his cut, and fear the boy sits there to play the spy and then tells Maskew.'\n\n'You're right,' said Greening of Ringstave, for I knew his slow drawl; 'and many a time when I have sat in The Wood, and watched the Manor to see Maskew safe at home before we ran a cargo, I have seen this boy too go round about the place with a hangdog look, scanning the house as if his life depended on't.'\n\n'Twas very true what Greening said; for of a summer evening I would take the path that led up Weatherbeech Hill, behind the Manor; both because 'twas a walk that had a good prospect in itself, and also a sweet charm for me, namely, the hope of seeing Grace Maskew. And there I often sat upon the stile that ends the path and opens on the down, and watched the old half-ruined house below; and sometimes saw white-frocked Gracie walking on the terrace in the evening sun, and sometimes in returning passed her window near enough to wave a greeting. And once, when she had the fever, and Dr. Hawkins came twice a day to see her, I had no heart for school, but sat on that stile the livelong day, looking at the gabled house where she was lying ill. And Mr. Glennie never rated me for playing truant, nor told Aunt Jane, guessing, as I thought afterwards, the cause, and having once been young himself. 'Twas but boy's love, yet serious for me; and on the day she lay near death, I made so bold as to stop Dr. Hawkins on his horse and ask him how she did; and he bearing with me for the eagerness that he read in my face, bent down over his saddle and smiled, and said my playmate would come back to me again.\n\nSo it was quite true that I had watched the house, but not as a spy, and would not have borne tales to old Maskew for anything that could be offered. Then Ratsey spoke up for me and said--''Tis a false scent. The boy is well enough, and simple, and has told me many a time he seeks the churchyard because there is a fine view to be had there of the sea, and 'tis the sea he loves. A month ago, when the high tide set, and this vault was so full of water that we could not get in, I came with Elzevir to make out if the floods were going down inside, or what eddy 'twas that set the casks tapping one against another. So as I lay on the ground with my ear glued close against the wall, who should march round the church but John Trenchard, Esquire, not treading delicately like King Agag, or spying, but just come on a voyage of discovery for himself. For in the church on Sunday, when we heard the tapping in the vault below, my young gentleman was scared enough; but afterwards, being told by Parson Glennie--who should know better--that such noises were not made by ghosts, but by the Mohunes at sea in their coffins, he plucks up heart, and comes down on the Monday to see if they are still afloat. So there he caught me lying like a zany on the ground. You may guess I stood at attention soon enough, but told him I was looking at the founds to see if they wanted underpinning from the floods. And so I set his mind at ease, for 'tis a simple child, and packed him off to get my dubbing hammer. And I think the boy will not be here so often now to frighten honest Parmiter, for I have weaved him some pretty tales of Blackbeard, and he has a wholesome scare of meeting the Colonel. But after dark I pledge my life that neither he nor any other in the town would pass the churchyard wall, no, not for a thousand pounds.'\n\nI heard him chuckling to himself, and the others laughed loudly too, when he was telling how he palmed me off; but 'he laughs loudest who laughs last', thought I, and should have chuckled too, were it not for making the coffin creak. And then, to my surprise, Elzevir spoke: 'The lad is a brave lad; I would he were my son. He is David's age, and will make a good sailor later on.'\n\nThey were simple words, yet pleasing to me; for Elzevir spoke as if he meant them, and I had got to like him a little in spite of all his grimness; and beside that, was sorry for his grief over his son. I was so moved by what he said, that for a moment I was for jumping up and calling out to him that I lay here and liked him well, but then thought better of it, and so kept still.\n\n\nThe carrying was over, and I fancy they were all sitting on the ends of kegs or leaning up against the pile; but could not see, and was still much troubled with the torch smoke, though now and then I caught through it a whiff of tobacco, which showed that some were smoking.\n\n\nThen Greening, who had a singing voice for all his drawl, struck up with--\n\nSays the Cap'n to the crew,\nWe have slipt the revenue,\n\nbut Ratsey stopped him with a sharp 'No more of that; the words aren't to our taste tonight, but come as wry as if the parson called _Old Hundred_ and I tuned up with _Veni_.' I knew he meant the last verse with a hanging touch in it; but Greening was for going on with the song, until some others broke in too, and he saw that the company would have none of it.\n\n'Not but what the labourer is worthy of his hire,' went on Master Ratsey; 'so spile that little breaker of Schiedam, and send a rummer round to keep off midnight chills.'\n\nHe loved a glass of the good liquor well, and with him 'twas always the same reasoning, namely, to keep off chills; though he chopped the words to suit the season, and now 'twas autumn, now winter, now spring, or summer chills.\n\nThey must have found glasses, though I could not remember to have seen any in the vault, for a minute later fugleman Ratsey spoke again--\n\n'Now, lads, glasses full and bumpers for a toast. And here's to Blackbeard, to Father Blackbeard, who watches over our treasure better than he did over his own; for were it not the fear of him that keeps off idle feet and prying eyes, we should have the gaugers in, and our store ransacked twenty times.'\n\nSo he spoke, and it seemed there was a little halting at first, as of men not liking to take Blackbeard's name in Blackbeard's place, or raise the Devil by mocking at him. But then some of the bolder shouted 'Blackbeard', and so the more timid chimed in, and in a minute there were a score of voices calling 'Blackbeard, Blackbeard', till the place rang again.\n\nThen Elzevir cried out angrily, 'Silence. Are you mad, or has the liquor mastered you? Are you Revenue-men that you dare shout and roister? or contrabandiers with the lugger in the offing, and your life in your hand. You make noise enough to wake folk in Moonfleet from their beds.'\n\n'Tut, man,' retorted Ratsey testily, 'and if they waked, they would but pull the blankets tight about their ears, and say 'twas Blackbeard piping his crew of lost Mohunes to help him dig for treasure.'\n\nYet for all that 'twas plain that Block ruled the roost, for there was silence for a minute, and then one said, 'Ay, Master Elzevir is right; let us away, the night is far spent, and we have nothing but the sweeps to take the lugger out of sight by dawn.'\n\nSo the meeting broke up, and the torchlight grew dimmer, and died away as it had come in a red flicker on the roof, and the footsteps sounded fainter as they went up the passage, until the vault was left to the dead men and me.",
    "There were a half-dozen of us boys, and as many girls, whom Mr. Glennie used to teach; and that you may see what sort of man Maskew was, I will tell you what happened one day in school between him and the parson. Mr. Glennie taught us in the almshouses; for though there were now no bedesmen, and the houses themselves were fallen to decay, yet the little hall in which the inmates had once dined was still maintained, and served for our schoolroom. It was a long and lofty room, with a high wainscot all round it, a carved oak screen at one end, and a broad window at the other. A very heavy table, polished by use, and sadly besmirched with ink, ran down the middle of the hall with benches on either side of it for us to use; and a high desk for Mr. Glennie stood under the window at the end of the room. Thus we were sitting one morning with our summing-slates and grammars before us when the door in the screen opens and Mr. Maskew enters.\n\nI have told you already of the verses which Mr. Glennie wrote for David Block's grave; and when the floods had gone down Ratsey set up the headstone with the poetry carved on it. But Maskew, through not going to church, never saw the stone for weeks, until one morning, walking through the churchyard, he lighted on it, and knew the verses for Mr. Glennie's. So 'twas to have it out with the parson that he had come to school this day; and though we did not know so much then, yet guessed from his presence that something was in the wind, and could read in his face that he was very angry. Now, for all that we hated Maskew, yet were we glad enough to see him there, as hoping for something strange to vary the sameness of school, and scenting a disturbance in the air. Only Grace was ill at ease for fear her father should say something unseemly, and kept her head down with shocks of hair falling over her book, though I could see her blushing between them. So in vapours Maskew, and with an angry glance about him makes straight for the desk where our master sits at the top of the room.\n\nFor a moment Mr. Glennie, being shortsighted, did not see who 'twas; but as his visitor drew near, rose courteously to greet him.\n\n'Good day to you, Mister Maskew,' says he, holding out his hand.\n\nBut Maskew puts his arms behind his back and bubbles out, 'Hold not out your hand to me lest I spit on it. 'Tis like your snivelling cant to write sweet psalms for smuggling rogues and try to frighten honest men with your judgements.'\n\nAt first Mr. Glennie did not know what the other would be at, and afterwards understanding, turned very pale; but said as a minister he would never be backward in reproving those whom he considered in the wrong, whether from the pulpit or from the gravestone. Then Maskew flies into a great passion, and pours out many vile and insolent words, saying Mr. Glennie is in league with the smugglers and fattens on their crimes; that the poetry is a libel; and that he, Maskew, will have the law of him for calumny.\n\nAfter that he took Grace by the arm, and bade her get hat and cape and come with him. 'For,' says he, 'I will not have thee taught any more by a psalm-singing hypocrite that calls thy father murderer.' And all the while he kept drawing up closer to Mr. Glennie, until the two stood very near each other.\n\nThere was a great difference between them; the one short and blustering, with a red face turned up; the other tall and craning down, ill-clad, ill-fed, and pale. Maskew had in his left hand a basket, with which he went marketing of mornings, for he made his own purchases, and liked fish, as being cheaper than meat. He had been chaffering with the fishwives this very day, and was bringing back his provend with him when he visited our school.\n\nThen he said to Mr. Glennie: 'Now, Sir Parson, the law has given into your fool's hands a power over this churchyard, and 'tis your trade to stop unseemly headlines from being set up within its walls, or once set up, to turn them out forthwith. So I give you a week's grace, and if tomorrow sennight yon stone be not gone, I will have it up and flung in pieces outside the wall.'\n\nMr. Glennie answered him in a low voice, but quite clear, so that we could hear where we sat: 'I can neither turn the stone out myself, nor stop you from turning it out if you so mind; but if you do this thing, and dishonour the graveyard, there is One stronger than either you or I that must be reckoned with.'\n\nI knew afterwards that he meant the Almighty, but thought then that 'twas of Elzevir he spoke; and so, perhaps, did Mr. Maskew, for he fell into a worse rage, thrust his hand in the basket, whipped out a great sole he had there, and in a twinkling dashes it in Mr. Glennie's face, with a 'Then, take that for an unmannerly parson, for I would not foul my fist with your mealy chops.'\n\nBut to see that stirred my choler, for Mr. Glennie was weak as wax, and would never have held up his hand to stop a blow, even were he strong as Goliath. So I was for setting on Maskew, and being a stout lad for my age, could have had him on the floor as easy as a baby; but as I rose from my seat, I saw he held Grace by the hand, and so hung back for a moment, and before I got my thoughts together he was gone, and I saw the tail of Grace's cape whisk round the screen door.\n\nA sole is at the best an ugly thing to have in one's face, and this sole was larger than most, for Maskew took care to get what he could for his money, so it went with a loud smack on Mr. Glennie's cheek, and then fell with another smack on the floor. At this we all laughed, as children will, and Mr. Glennie did not check us, but went back and sat very quiet at his desk; and soon I was sorry I had laughed, for he looked sad, with his face sanded and a great red patch on one side, and beside that the fin had scratched him and made a blood-drop trickle down his cheek. A few minutes later the thin voice of the almshouse clock said twelve, and away walked Mr. Glennie without his usual 'Good day, children', and there was the sole left lying on the dusty floor in front of his desk.\n\n\nIt seemed a shame so fine a fish should be wasted, so I picked it up and slipped it in my desk, sending Fred Burt to get his mother's gridiron that we might grill it on the schoolroom fire. While he was gone I went out to the court to play, and had not been there five minutes when back comes Maskew through our playground without Grace, and goes into the schoolroom. But in the screen at the end of the room was a chink, against which we used to hold our fingers on bright days for the sun to shine through, and show the blood pink; so up I slipped and fixed my eye to the hole, wanting to know what he was at. He had his basket with him, and I soon saw he had come back for the sole, not having the heart to leave so good a bit of fish. But look where he would, he could not find it, for he never searched my desk, and had to go off with a sour countenance; but Fred Burt and I cooked the sole, and found it well flavoured, for all it had given so much pain to Mr. Glennie.\n\nAfter that Grace came no more to school, both because her father had said she should not, and because she was herself ashamed to go back after what Maskew had done to Mr. Glennie.",
    "One evening in March, when the days were lengthening fast, there came a messenger from Dorchester, and brought printed notices for fixing to the shutters of the Why Not? and to the church door, which said that in a week's time the bailiff of the duchy of Cornwall would visit Moonfleet. This bailiff was an important person, and his visits stood as events in village history. Once in five years he made a perambulation, or journey, through the whole duchy, inspecting all the Royal property, and arranging for new leases. His visits to Moonfleet were generally short enough, for owing to the Mohunes owning all the land, the only duchy estate there was the Why Not? and the only duty of the bailiff to renew that five-year lease, under which Blocks had held the inn, father and son, for generations. But for all that, the business was not performed without ceremony, for there was a solemn show of putting up the lease of the inn to the highest bidder, though it was well understood that no one except Elzevir would make an offer.\n\nSo one morning, a week later, I went up to the top end of the village to watch for the bailiff's postchaise, and about eleven of the forenoon saw it coming down the hill with four horses and two postillions. Presently it came past, and I saw there were two men in it--a clerk sitting with his back to the horses, and in the seat opposite a little man in a periwig, whom I took for the bailiff. Then I ran down to my aunt's house, for Elzevir had asked me to beg one of her best winter candles for a purpose which I will explain presently. I had not seen Aunt Jane, except in church, since the day that she dismissed me, but she was no stiffer than usual, and gave me the candle readily enough. 'There,' she said, 'take it, and I wish it may bring light into your dark heart, and show you what a wicked thing it is to leave your own kith and kin and go to dwell in a tavern.' I was for saying that it was kith and kin that left me, and not I them; and as for living in a tavern, it was better to live there than nowhere at all, as she would wish me to do in turning me out of her house; but did not, and only thanked her for the candle, and was off.\n\nWhen I came to the inn, there was the postchaise in front of the door, the horses being led away to bait, and a little group of villagers standing round; for though the auction of the Why Not? was in itself a trite thing with a foregone conclusion, yet the bailiff's visit always stirred some show of interest. There were a few children with their noses flattened against the windows of the parlour, and inside were Mr. Bailiff and Mr. Clerk hard at work on their dinner. Mr. Bailiff, who was, as I guessed, the little man in the periwig, sat at the top of the table, and Mr. Clerk sat at the bottom, and on chairs were placed their hats, and travelling-cloaks, and bundles of papers tied together with green tape. You may be sure that Elzevir had a good dinner for them, with hot rabbit pie and cold round of brawn, and a piece of blue vinny, which Mr. Bailiff ate heartily, but his clerk would not touch, saying he had as lief chew soap. There was also a bottle of Ararat milk, and a flagon of ale, for we were afraid to set French wines before them, lest they should fall to wondering how they were come by.\n\nElzevir took the candle, chiding me a little for being late, and set it in a brass candlestick in the middle of the table. Then Mr. Clerk takes a little rule from his pocket, measures an inch down on the candle, sticks into the grease at that point a scarf-pin with an onyx head that Elzevir lent him, and lights the wick. Now the reason of this was, that the custom ran in Moonfleet when either land or lease was put up to bidding, to stick a pin in a candle; and so long as the pin held firm, it was open to any to make a better offer, but when the flame burnt down and the pin fell out, then land or lease fell to the last bidder. So after dinner was over and the table cleared, Mr. Clerk takes out a roll of papers and reads a legal description of the Why Not?, calling it the Mohune Arms, an excellent messuage or tenement now used as a tavern, and speaking of the convenient paddocks or parcels of grazing land at the back of it, called Moons'-lease, amounting to sixteen acres more or less. Then he invites the company to make an offer of rent for such a desirable property under a five years' lease, and as Elzevir and I are the only company present, the bidding is soon done; for Elzevir offers a rent of \u00a312 a year, which has always been the value of the Why Not? The clerk makes a note of this; but the business is not over yet, for we must wait till the pin drops out of the candle before the lease is finally made out. So the men fell to smoking to pass the time, till there could not have been more than ten minutes' candle to burn, and Mr. Bailiff, with a glass of Ararat milk in his hand, was saying, ''Tis a curious and fine tap of Hollands you keep here, Master Block,' when in walked Mr. Maskew.\n\nA thunderbolt would not have astonished me so much as did his appearance, and Elzevir's face grew black as night; but the bailiff and clerk showed no surprise, not knowing the terms on which persons in our village stood to one another, and thinking it natural that someone should come in to see the pin drop, and the end of an ancient custom. Indeed, Maskew seemed to know the bailiff, for he passed the time of day with him, and was then for sitting down at the table without taking any notice of Elzevir or me. But just as he began to seat himself, Block shouted out, 'You are no welcome visitor in my house, and I would sooner see your back than see your face, but sit at this table you shall not.' I knew what he meant; for on that table they had laid out David's body, and with that he struck his fist upon the board so smart as to make the bailiff jump and nearly bring the pin out of the candle.\n\n'Heyday, sirs,' says Mr. Bailiff, astonished, 'let us have no brawling here, the more so as this worshipful gentleman is a magistrate and something of a friend of mine.' Yet Maskew refrained from sitting, but stood by the bailiff's chair, turning white, and not red, as he did with Mr. Glennie; and muttered something, that he had as lief stand as sit, and that it should soon be Block's turn to ask sitting-room of _him_.\n\nI was wondering what possibly could have brought Maskew there, when the bailiff, who was ill at ease, said--'Come, Mr. Clerk, the pin hath but another minute's hold; rehearse what has been done, for I must get this lease delivered and off to Bridport, where much business waits.'\n\nSo the clerk read in a singsong voice that the property of the duchy of Cornwall, called the Mohune Arms, an inn or tavern, with all its land, tenements, and appurtenances, situate in the Parish of St. Sebastian, Moonfleet, having been offered on lease for five years, would be let to Elzevir Block at a rent of \u00a312 per annum, unless anyone offered a higher rent before the pin fell from the candle.\n\nThere was no one to make another offer, and the bailiff said to Elzevir, 'Tell them to have the horses round, the pin will be out in a minute, and 'twill save time.' So Elzevir gave the order, and then we all stood round in silence, waiting for the pin to fall. The grease had burnt down to the mark, or almost below it, as it appeared; but just where the pin stuck in there was a little lump of harder tallow that held bravely out, refusing to be melted. The bailiff gave a stamp of impatience with his foot under the table as though he hoped thus to shake out the pin, and then a little dry voice came from Maskew, saying--\n\n'I offer \u00a313 a year for the inn.'\n\nThis fell upon us with so much surprise, that all looked round, seeking as it were some other speaker, and never thinking that it could be Maskew. Elzevir was the first, I believe, to fully understand 'twas he; and without turning to look at bailiff or Maskew, but having his elbows on the table, his face between his hands, and looking straight out to sea said in a sturdy voice, 'I offer \u00a320.'\n\nThe words were scarce out of his mouth when Maskew caps them with \u00a321, and so in less than a minute the rent of the Why Not? was near doubled. Then the bailiff looked from one to the other, not knowing what to make of it all, nor whether 'twas comedy or serious, and said--\n\n'Kind sir, I warn ye not to trifle; I have no time to waste in April fooling, and he who makes offers in sport will have to stand to them in earnest.'\n\nBut there was no lack of earnest in one at least of the men that he had before him, and the voice with which Elzevir said \u00a330 was still sturdy. Maskew called \u00a331 and \u00a341, and Elzevir \u00a340 and \u00a350, and then I looked at the candle, and saw that the head of the pin was no longer level, it had sunk a little--a very little. The clerk awoke from his indifference, and was making notes of the bids with a squeaking quill, the bailiff frowned as being puzzled, and thinking that none had a right to puzzle him. As for me, I could not sit still, but got on my feet, if so I might better bear the suspense; for I understood now that Maskew had made up his mind to turn Elzevir out, and that Elzevir was fighting for his home. _His_ home, and had he not made it my home too, and were we both to be made outcasts to please the spite of this mean little man?\n\nThere were some more bids, and then I knew that Maskew was saying \u00a391, and saw the head of the pin was lower; the hard lump of tallow in Aunt Jane's candle was thawing. The bailiff struck in: 'Are ye mad, sirs, and you, Master Block, save your breath, and spare your money; and if this worshipful gentleman must become innkeeper at any price, let him have the place in the Devil's name, and I will give thee the Mermaid, at Bridport, with a snug parlour, and ten times the trade of this.'\n\nElzevir seemed not to hear what he said, but only called out \u00a3100, with his face still looking out to sea, and the same sturdiness in his voice. Then Maskew tried a spring, and went to \u00a3120, and Elzevir capped him with \u00a3130, and \u00a3140, \u00a3150, \u00a3160, \u00a3170 followed quick. My breath came so fast that I was almost giddy, and I had to clench my hands to remind myself of where I was, and what was going on. The bidders too were breathing hard, Elzevir had taken his head from his hands, and the eyes of all were on the pin. The lump of tallow was worn down now; it was hard to say why the pin did not fall. Maskew gulped out \u00a3180, and Elzevir said \u00a3190, and then the pin gave a lurch, and I thought the Why Not? was saved, though at the price of ruin. No; the pin had not fallen, there was a film that held it by the point, one second, only one second. Elzevir's breath, which was ready to outbid whatever Maskew said, caught in his throat with the catching pin, and Maskew sighed out \u00a3200, before the pin pattered on the bottom of the brass candlestick.",
    "The while chalk was a bulwark between us and the foe; and though one or two of them loosed off their matchlocks, trying to get at us sideways, they could not even see their quarry, and 'twas only shooting at a venture. We were safe. But for how short a time! Safe just for so long as it should please the soldiers not to come down to take us, safe with a discharged pistol in our grasp, and a shot man lying at our feet.\n\nElzevir was the first to speak: 'Can you stand, John? Is the bone broken?'\n\n'I cannot stand,' I said; 'there is something gone in my leg, and I feel blood running down into my boot.'\n\nHe knelt, and rolled down the leg of my stocking; but though he only moved my foot ever so little, it caused me sharp pain, for feeling was coming back after the first numbness of the shot.\n\n'They have broke the leg, though it bleeds little,' Elzevir said. 'We have no time to splice it here, but I will put a kerchief round, and while I wrap it, listen to how we lie, and then choose what we shall do.'\n\nI nodded, biting my lips hard to conceal the pain he gave me, and he went on: 'We have a quarter of an hour before the Posse can get down to us. But come they will, and thou canst judge what chance we have to save liberty or life with that carrion lying by us'--and he jerked his thumb at Maskew--'though I am glad 'twas not my hand that sent him to his reckoning, and therefore do not blame thee if thou didst make me waste a charge in air. So one thing we can do is to wait here until they come, and I can account for a few of them before they shoot me down; but thou canst not fight with a broken leg, and they will take thee alive, and then there is a dance on air at Dorchester Jail.'\n\nI felt sick with pain and bitterly cast down to think that I was like to come so soon to such a vile end; so only gave a sigh, wishing heartily that Maskew were not dead, and that my leg were not broke, but that I was back again at the Why Not? or even hearing one of Dr. Sherlock's sermons in my aunt's parlour.\n\nElzevir looked down at me when I sighed, and seeing, I suppose, that I was sorrowful, tried to put a better face on a bad business. 'Forgive me, lad,' he said, 'if I have spoke too roughly. There is yet another way that we may try; and if thou hadst but two whole legs, I would have tried it, but now 'tis little short of madness. And yet, if thou fear'st not, I will still try it. Just at the end of this flat ledge, farthest from where the bridle-path leads down, but not a hundred yards from where we stand, there is a sheep-track leading up the cliff. It starts where the under-cliff dies back again into the chalk face, and climbs by slants and elbow-turns up to the top. The shepherds call it the Zigzag, and even sheep lose their footing on it; and of men I never heard but one had climbed it, and that was lander Jordan, when the Excise was on his heels, half a century back. But he that tries it stakes all on head and foot, and a wounded bird like thee may not dare that flight. Yet, if thou art content to hang thy life upon a hair, I will carry thee some way; and where there is no room to carry, thou must down on hands and knees and trail thy foot.'\n\nIt was a desperate chance enough, but came as welcome as a patch of blue through lowering skies. 'Yes,' I said, 'dear Master Elzevir, let us get to it quickly; and if we fall, 'tis better far to die upon the rocks below than to wait here for them to hale us off to jail.' And with that I tried to stand, thinking I might go dot and carry even with a broken leg. But 'twas no use, and down I sank with a groan. Then Elzevir caught me up, holding me in his arms, with my head looking over his back, and made off for the Zigzag. And as we slunk along, close to the cliff-side, I saw, between the brambles, Maskew lying with his face turned up to the morning sky. And there was the little red hole in the middle of his forehead, and a thread of blood that welled up from it and trickled off on to the sward.\n\nIt was a sight to stagger any man, and would have made me swoon perhaps, but that there was no time, for we were at the end of the under-cliff, and Elzevir set me down for a minute, before he buckled to his task. And 'twas a task that might cow the bravest, and when I looked upon the Zigzag, it seemed better to stay where we were and fall into the hands of the Posse than set foot on that awful way, and fall upon the rocks below. For the Zigzag started off as a fair enough chalk path, but in a few paces narrowed down till it was but a whiter thread against the grey-white cliff-face, and afterwards turned sharply back, crossing a hundred feet direct above our heads. And then I smelt an evil stench, and looking about, saw the blown-out carcass of a rotting sheep lie close at hand.\n\n'Faugh,' said Elzevir, 'tis a poor beast has lost his foothold.'\n\nIt was an ill omen enough, and I said as much, beseeching him to make his own way up the Zigzag and leave me where I was, for that they might have mercy on a boy.\n\n'Tush!' he cried; 'it is thy heart that fails thee, and 'tis too late now to change counsel. We have fifteen minutes yet to win or lose with, and if we gain the cliff-top in that time we shall have an hour's start, or more, for they will take all that to search the under-cliff. And Maskew, too, will keep them in check a little, while they try to bring the life back to so good a man. But if we fall, why, we shall fall together, and outwit their cunning. So shut thy eyes, and keep them tight until I bid thee open them.' With that he caught me up again, and I shut my eyes firm, rebuking myself for my faint-heartedness, and not telling him how much my foot hurt me. In a minute I knew from Elzevir's steps that he had left the turf and was upon the chalk. Now I do not believe that there were half a dozen men beside in England who would have ventured up that path, even free and untrammelled, and not a man in all the world to do it with a full-grown lad in his arms. Yet Elzevir made no bones of it, nor spoke a single word; only he went very slow, and I felt him scuffle with his foot as he set it forward, to make sure he was putting it down firm.\n\nI said nothing, not wishing to distract him from his terrible task, and held my breath, when I could, so that I might lie quieter in his arms. Thus he went on for a time that seemed without end, and yet was really but a minute or two; and by degrees I felt the wind, that we could scarce perceive at all on the under-cliff, blow fresher and cold on the cliff-side. And then the path grew steeper and steeper, and Elzevir went slower and slower, till at last he spoke: 'John, I am going to stop; but open not thy eyes till I have set thee down and bid thee.'",
    "We stood for a moment holding one another's hands; then Ratsey spoke. 'John, these two months have changed thee from boy to man. Thou wast a child when I turned that morning as we went up Hoar Head with the pack-horses, and looked back on thee and Elzevir below, and Maskew lying on the ground. 'Twas a sorry business, and has broken up the finest gang that ever ran a cargo, besides driving thee and Elzevir to hide in caves and dens of the earth. Thou shouldst have come with us that morn; not have stayed behind. The work was too rough for boys: the skipper should have piped the reefing-hands.'\n\nIt was true enough, or seemed to me true then, for I felt much cast down; but only said, 'Nay, Master Ratsey, where Master Block stays, there I must stay too, and where he goes I follow.'\n\nThen I sat down upon the bed in the corner, feeling my leg began to ache; and the storm, which had lulled for a few minutes, came up again all the fiercer with wilder gusts and showers of spray and rain driving into the cave from seaward. So I was scarce sat down when in came a roaring blast, filling even our corner with cold, wet air, that quenched the weakling candle flame.\n\n'God save us, what a night!' Ratsey cried.\n\n'God save poor souls at sea,' said I.\n\n'Amen to that,' says he, 'and would that every Amen I have said had come as truly from my heart. There will be sea enough on Moonfleet Beach this night to lift a schooner to the top of it, and launch her down into the fields behind. I had as lief be in the Mohune vault as in this fearsome place, and liefer too, if half the tales men tell are true of faces that may meet one here. For God's sake let us light a fire, for I caught sight of a store of driftwood before that sickly candle went out.'\n\nIt was some time before we got a fire alight, and even after the flame had caught well hold, the rush of the wind would every now and again blow the smoke into our eyes, or send a shower of sparks dancing through the cave. But by degrees the logs began to glow clear white, and such a cheerful warmth came out, as was in itself a solace and remedy for man's afflictions.\n\n'Ah!' said Ratsey, 'I was shrammed with wet and cold, and half-dead with this baffling wind. It is a blessed thing a fire,' and he unbuttoned his pilot-coat, 'and needful now, if ever. My soul is very low, lad, for this place has strange memories for me; and I recollect, forty years ago (when I was just a boy like thee), old lander Jordan's gang, and I among them, were in this very cave on such another night. I was new to the trade then, as thou might be, and could not sleep for noise of wind and sea. And in the small hours of an autumn morning, as I lay here, just where we lie now, I heard such wailing cries above the storm, ay, and such shrieks of women, as made my blood run cold and have not yet forgot them. And so I woke the gang who were all deep asleep as seasoned contrabandiers should be; but though we knew that there were fellow-creatures fighting for their lives in the seething flood beneath us, we could not stir hand or foot to save them, for nothing could be seen for rain and spray, and 'twas not till next morning that we learned the _Florida_ had foundered just below with every soul on board. Ay, 'tis a queer life, and you and Block are in a queer strait now, and that is what I came to tell you. See here.' And he took out of his pocket an oblong strip of printed paper:\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nG.R.\n\nWHITEHALL, 15 May 1758\n\nWhereas it hath been humbly represented to the King that on Friday, the night of the 16th of April last, THOMAS MASKEW, a Justice of the Peace, was most inhumanly murdered at Hoar Head, a lone place in the Parish of Chaldron, in the County of Dorset, by one ELZEVIR BLOCK and one JOHN TRENCHARD, both of the Parish of Moonfleet, in the aforesaid County: His Majesty, for the better discovering and bringing to Justice these Persons, is pleased to promise His Most Gracious PARDON to any of the Persons concerned therein, except the Persons who actually committed the said Murder; and, as a further Encouragement, a REWARD OF FIFTY POUNDS to any Person who shall furnish such INFORMATION as shall lead to the APPREHENSION of the said ELZEVIR BLOCK, and a REWARD of TWENTY POUNDS to any Person who shall furnish such INFORMATION as shall lead to the APPREHENSION of the said JOHN TRENCHARD. Such INFORMATION to be given to ME, or to the GOVERNOUR of His MAJESTY'S GAOL in Dorchester.\n\nHOLDERNESSE.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n'There--that's the bill,' he said; 'and a vastly fine piece it is, and yet I wish that 'twas played with other actors. Now, in Moonfleet there is none that know your hiding-place, and not a man, nor woman either, that would tell if they knew it ten times over. But fifty pounds for Elzevir, and twenty pounds for an empty pumpkin-top like thine, is a fair round sum, and there are vagabonds about this countryside scurvy enough to try to earn it. And some of these have set the Excisemen on _my_ track, with tales of how it is I that know where you lie hid, and bring you meat and drink. So it is that I cannot stir abroad now, no, not even to the church o' Sundays, without having some rogue lurking at my heels to watch my movements. And that is why I chose such a night to come hither, knowing these knaves like dry skins, but never thinking that the wind would blow like this. I am come to tell Block that 'tis not safe for me to be so much in Purbeck, and that I dare no longer bring food or what not, or these man-hounds will scent you out. Your leg is sound again, and 'tis best to be flitting while you may, and there's the _\u00c9peron d'Or,_ and Chauvelais to give you welcome on the other side.'\n\nI told him how Elzevir was gone this very night to Poole to settle with the _Bonaventure_, when she should come to take us off; and at that Ratsey seemed pleased. There were many things I wished to learn of him, and especially how Grace did, but felt a shyness, and durst not ask him. And he said no more for a minute, seeming low-hearted and crouching over the fire. So we sat huddled in the corner by the glowing logs, the red light flickering on the cave roof, and showing the lines on Ratsey's face; while the steam rose from his drying clothes. The gale blew as fiercely as ever, but the tide had fallen, and there was not so much spray coming into the cave. Then Ratsey spoke again--\n\n'My heart is very heavy, John, tonight, to think how all the good old times are gone, and how that Master Block can never again go back to Moonfleet. It was as fine a lander's crew as ever stood together, not even excepting Captain Jordan's, and now must all be broken up; for this mess of Maskew's has made the place too hot to hold us, and 'twill be many a long day before another cargo's run on Moonfleet Beach. But how to get the liquor out of Mohune's vault I know not; and that reminds me, I have something in my pouches for Elzevir an' thee'; and with that he drew forth either lapel a great wicker-bound flask. He put one to his lips, tilting it and drinking long and deep, and then passed it to me, with a sigh of satisfaction. 'Ah, that has the right smack. Here, take it, child, and warm thy heart; 'tis the true milk of Ararat, and the last thou'lt taste this side the Channel.'",
    "'Well, seeing there was no one save this poor girl to look to putting Maskew under ground, I must needs take it in hand myself; roughing together a sound coffin and digging as fair a grave for him as could be made for any lord, except that lords have always vaults to sleep in. Then I got Mother Nutting's fish-cart to carry the body down, for there was not a man in Moonfleet would lay hand to the coffin to bear it; and off we started down the street, I leading the wall-eyed pony, and the coffin following on the trolley. There was no mourner to see him home except his daughter, and she without a bit of black upon her, for she had no time to get her crapes; and yet she needed none, having grief writ plain enough upon her face.\n\nWhen we got to the churchyard, a crowd was gathered there, men and women and children, not only from Moonfleet but from Ringstave and Monkbury. They were not come to mourn, but to make gibes to show how much they hated him, and many of the children had old pots and pans for rough music. Parson Glennie was waiting in the church, and there he waited, for the cart could not pass the gate, and we had no bearers to lift the coffin. Then I looked round to see if there was any that would help to lift, but when I tried to meet a man's eye he looked away, and all I could see was the bitter scowling faces of the women. And all the while the girl stood by the trolley looking on the ground. She had a little kerchief over her head that let the hair fall about her shoulders, and her face was very white, with eyes red and swollen through weeping. But when she knew that all that crowd was there to mock her father, and that there was not a man would raise hand to lift him, she laid her head upon the coffin, hiding her face in her hands, and sobbed bitterly.'\n\nRatsey stopped for a moment and drank again deep at the flask; and as for me, I still said nothing, feeling a great lump in my throat; and reflecting how hatred and passion have power to turn men to brutes.\n\n'I am a rough man,' Ratsey resumed, 'but tender-like withal, and when I saw her weep, I ran off to the church to tell the parson how it was, and beg him to come out and try if we two could lift the coffin. So out he came just as he was, with surplice on his back and book in hand. But when the men knew what he was come for, and looked upon that tall, fair girl bowed down over her father's coffin, their hearts were moved, and first Tom Tewkesbury stepped out with a sheepish air, and then Garrett, and then four others. So now we had six fine bearers, and 'twas only women that could still look hard and scowling, and even they said no word, and not a boy beat on his pan.\n\n'Then Mr. Glennie, seeing he was not wanted for bearer, changed to parson, and strikes up with \"I am the resurrection and the life\". 'Tis a great text, John, and though I've heard it scores and scores of times, it never sounded sweeter than on that day. For 'twas a fine afternoon, and what with there being no wind, but the sun bright and the sea still and blue, there was a calm on everything that seemed to say \"Rest in Peace, Rest in Peace\". And was not the spring with us, and the whole land preaching of resurrection, the birds singing, trees and flowers waking from their winter sleep, and cowslips yellow on the very graves? Then surely 'tis a fond thing to push our enmities beyond the grave, and perhaps even _he_ was not so bad as we held him, but might have tricked himself into thinking he did right to hunt down the contraband. I know not how it was, but something like this came into my mind, and did perhaps to others, for we got him under without a sign or word from any that stood there. There was not one sound heard inside the church or out, except Mr. Glennie's reading and my amens, and now and then a sob from the poor child. But when 'twas all over, and the coffin safe lowered, up she walks to Tom Tewkesbury saying, through her tears, \"I thank you, sir, for your kindness,\" and holds out her hand. So he took it, looking askew, and afterwards the five other bearers; and then she walked away by herself, and no one moved till she had left the churchyard gate, letting her pass out like a queen.'\n\n'And so she is a queen,' I said, not being able to keep from speaking, for very pride to hear how she had borne herself, and because she had always shown kindness to me. 'So she is, and fairer than any queen to boot.'\n\nRatsey gave me a questioning look, and I could see a little smile upon his face in the firelight. 'Ay, she is fair enough,' said he, as though reflecting to himself, 'but white and thin. Mayhap she would make a match for thee--if ye were man and woman, and not boy and girl; if she were not rich, and thou not poor and an outlaw; and--if she would have thee.'\n\nIt vexed me to hear his banter, and to think how I had let my secret out, so I did not answer, and we sat by the embers for a while without speaking, while the wind still blew through the cave like a funnel.",
    "We took an evening in late summer for our venture, and came to Aldobrand's house about an hour before sundown. I remember the place well, though I have not seen it for so long, and am certainly never like to see it again. It was a low house of two stories standing back a little from the street, with some wooden palings and a grass plot before it, and a stone-flagged path leading up to the door. The front of it was whitewashed, with green shutters, and had a shiny-leaved magnolia trained round about the windows. These jewellers had no shops, though sometimes they set a single necklace or bracelet in a bottom window, but put up notices proclaiming their trade. Thus there was over Aldobrand's door a board stuck out to say that he bought and sold jewels, and would lend money on diamonds or other valuables.\n\nA sturdy serving-man opened the door, and when he heard our business was to sell a jewel, left us in a stone-floored hall or lobby, while he went upstairs to ask whether his master would see us. A few minutes later the stairs creaked, and Aldobrand himself came down. He was a little wizened man with yellow skin and deep wrinkles, not less than seventy years old; and I saw he wore shoes of polished leather, silver-buckled, and tilted-heeled to add to his stature. He began speaking to us from the landing, not coming down into the hall, but leaning over the handrail:\n\n'Well, my sons, what would you with me? I hear you have a jewel to sell, but you must know I do not purchase sailors' flotsam. So if 'tis a moonstone or catseye, or some pin-head diamonds, keep them to make brooches for your sweethearts, for Aldobrand buys no toys like that.'\n\nHe had a thin and squeaky voice, and spoke to us in our own tongue, guessing no doubt that we were English from our faces. 'Twas true he handled the language badly enough, yet I was glad he used it, for so I could follow all that was said.\n\n'No toys like that,' he said again, repeating his last words, and Elzevir answered: 'May it please your worship, we are sailors from over sea, and this boy has a diamond that he would sell.'\n\nI had the gem in my hand all ready, and when the old man squeaked peevishly, 'Out with it then, let's see, let's see,' I reached it out to him. He stretched down over the banisters, and took it; holding out his palm hollowed, as if 'twas some little paltry stone that might otherwise fall and be lost. It nettled me to have him thus underrate our treasure, even though he had never seen it, and so I plumped it down into his hand as if it were as big as a pumpkin. Now the hall was a dim place, being lit only by a half-circle of glass over the door, and so I could not see very well; yet in reaching down he brought his head near mine, and I could swear his face changed when he felt the size of the stone in his hand, and turned from impatience and contempt to wonder and delight. He took the jewel quickly from his palm, and held it up between finger and thumb, and when he spoke again, his voice was changed as well as his face, and had lost most of the sharp impatience.\n\n'There is not light enough to see in this dark place--follow me,' and he turned back and went upstairs rapidly, holding the stone in his hand; and we close at his heels, being anxious not to lose sight of him now that he had our diamond, for all he was so rich and well known a man.\n\nThus we came to another landing, and there he flung open the door of a room which looked out west, and had the light of the setting sun streaming in full flood through the window. The change from the dimness of the stairs to this level red blaze was so quick that for a minute I could make out nothing, but turning my back to the window saw presently that the room was panelled all through with painted wood, with a bed let into the wall on one side, and shelves round the others, on which were many small coffers and strong-boxes of iron. The jeweller was sitting at a table with his face to the sun, holding the diamond up against the light, and gazing into it closely, so that I could see every working of his face. The hard and cunning look had come back to it, and he turned suddenly upon me and asked quite sharply, 'What is your name, boy? Whence do you come?'\n\nNow I was not used to walk under false names, and he took me unawares, so I must needs blurt out, 'My name is John Trenchard, sir, and I come from Moonfleet, in Dorset.'\n\nA second later I could have bitten off my tongue for having said as much, and saw Elzevir frowning at me to make me hold my peace. But 'twas too late then, for the merchant was writing down my answer in a parchment ledger. And though it would seem to most but a little thing that he should thus take down my name and birthplace, and only vexed us at the time, because we would not have it known at all whence we came; yet in the overrulings of Providence it was ordered that this note in Mr. Aldobrand's book should hereafter change the issue of my life.\n\n'From Moonfleet, in Dorset,' he repeated to himself, as he finished writing my answer. 'And how did John Trenchard come by this?' and he tapped the diamond as it lay on the table before him.\n\nThen Elzevir broke in quickly, fearing no doubt lest I should be betrayed into saying more: 'Nay, sir, we are not come to play at questions and answers, but to know whether your worship will buy this diamond, and at what price. We have no time to tell long histories, and so must only say that we are English sailors, and that the stone is fairly come by.' And he let his fingers play with the diamond on the table, as if he feared it might slip away from him.\n\n'Softly, softly,' said the old man; 'all stones are fairly come by; but had you told me whence you got this, I might have spared myself some tedious tests, which now I must crave pardon for making.'\n\nHe opened a cupboard in the panelling, and took out from it a little pair of scales, some crystals, a black-stone, and a bottle full of a green liquid. Then he sat down again, drew the diamond gently from Elzevir's fingers, which were loth to part with it, and began using his scales; balancing the diamond carefully, now against a crystal, now against some small brass weights. I stood with my back to the sunset, watching the red light fall upon this old man as he weighed the diamond, rubbed it on the black-stone, or let fall on it a drop of the liquor, and so could see the wonder and emotion fade away from his face, and only hard craftiness left in it.\n\nI watched him meddling till I could bear to watch no longer, feeling a fierce feverish suspense as to what he might say, and my pulse beating so quick that I could scarce stand still. For was not the decisive moment very nigh when we should know, from these parched-up lips, the value of the jewel, and whether it was worth risking life for, whether the fabric of our hopes was built on sure foundation or on slippery sand? So I turned my back on the diamond merchant, and looked out of the window, waiting all the while to catch the slightest word that might come from his lips.\n\nI have found then and at other times that in such moments, though the mind be occupied entirely by one overwhelming thought, yet the eyes take in, as it were unwittingly, all that lies before them, so that we can afterwards recall a face or landscape of which at the time we took no note. Thus it was with me that night, for though I was thinking of nothing but the jewel, yet I noted everything that could be seen through the window, and the recollection was of use to me later on. The window was made in the French style, reaching down to the floor, and opening like a door with two leaves. It led on to a little balcony, and now stood open (for the day was still very hot), and on the wall below was trained a pear-tree, which half-embowered the balcony with its green leaves. The window could be well protected in case of need, having latticed wooden blinds inside, and heavy shutters shod with iron on the outer wall, and there were besides strong bolts and sockets from which ran certain wires whose use I did not know. Below the balcony was a square garden-plot, shut in with a brick wall, and kept very neat and trim. There were hollyhocks round the walls, and many-coloured poppies, with many other shrubs and flowers. My eyes fell on one especially, a tall red-blossomed rushy kind of flower, that I had never seen before; and that seemed indeed to be something out of the common, for it stood in the middle of a little earth-plot, and had the whole bed nearly to itself.\n\nI was looking at this flower, not thinking of it, but wondering all the while whether Mr. Aldobrand would say the diamond was worth ten thousand pounds, or fifty, or a hundred thousand, when I heard him speaking, and turned round quick. 'My sons, and you especially, son John,' he said, and turned to me: 'this stone that you have brought me is no stone at all, but glass--or rather paste, for so we call it. Not but what it is good paste, and perhaps the best that I have seen, and so I had to try it to make sure. But against high chymic tests no sham can stand; and first it is too light in weight, and second, when rubbed on this Basanus or Black-stone, traces no line of white, as any diamond must. But, third and last, I have tried it with the hermeneutic proof, and dipped it in this most costly lembic; and the liquor remains pure green and clear, not turbid orange, a diamond leaves it.'",
    "I felt the sickness and heart-sinking that comes with the sudden destruction of long-cherished hope. So it was all a sham, a bit of glass, for which we had risked our lives. Blackbeard had only mocked us even in his death, and from rich men we were become the poorest outcasts. And all the other bright fancies that had been built on this worthless thing fell down at once, like a house of cards. There was no money now with which to go back rich to Moonfleet, no money to cloak past offences, no money to marry Grace; and with that I gave a sigh, and my knees failing should have fallen had not Elzevir held me.\n\n'Nay, son John,' squeaked the old man, seeing I was so put about, 'take it not hardly, for though this is but paste, I say not it is worthless. It is as fine work as ever I have seen, and I will offer you ten silver crowns for it; which is a goodly sum for a sailor-lad to have in hand, and more than all the other buyers in this town would bid you for it.'\n\n'Tush, tush,' cried Elzevir, and I could hear the bitterness and disappointment in his voice, however much he tried to hide it; 'we are not come to beg for silver crowns, so keep them in your purse. And the devil take this shining sham; we are well quit of it; there is a curse upon the thing!' And with that he caught up the stone and flung it away out of the window in his anger.\n\nThis brought the diamond-buyer to his feet in a moment. 'You fool, you cursed fool!' he shrieked, 'are you come here to beard me? and when I say the thing is worth ten silver crowns do you fling it to the winds?'\n\nI had sprung forward with a half thought of catching Elzevir's arm; but it was too late--the stone flew up in the air, caught the low rays of the setting sun for a moment, and then fell among the flowers. I could not see it as it fell, yet followed with my eyes the line in which it should have fallen, and thought I saw a glimmer where it touched the earth. It was only a flash or sparkle for an instant, just at the stem of that same rushy red-flowered plant, and then nothing more to be seen; but as I faced round I saw the little man's eyes turned that way too, and perhaps he saw the flash as well as I.\n\n'There's for your ten crowns!' said Elzevir. 'Let us be going, lad.' And he took me by the arm and marched me out of the room and down the stairs.\n\n'Go, and a blight on you!' says Mr. Aldobrand, his voice being not so high as when he cried out last, but in his usual squeak; and then he repeated, 'a blight on you,' just for a parting shot as we went through the door.\n\nWe passed two more waiting-men on the stairs, but they said nothing to us, and so we came to the street.\n\n\nWe walked along together for some time without a word, and then Elzevir said, 'Cheer up, lad, cheer up. Thou saidst thyself thou fearedst there was a curse on the thing, so now it is gone, maybe we are well quit of it.'\n\nYet I could not say anything, being too much disappointed to find the diamond was a sham, and bitterly cast down at the loss of all our hopes. It was all very well to think there was a curse upon the stone so long as we had it, and to feign that we were ready to part with it; but now it was gone I knew that at heart I never wished to part with it at all, and would have risked any curse to have it back again. There was supper waiting for us when we got back, but I had no stomach for victuals and sat moodily while Elzevir ate, and he not much. But when I sat and brooded over what had happened, a new thought came to my mind and I jumped up and cried, 'Elzevir, we are fools! The stone is no sham; 'tis a real diamond!'\n\nHe put down his knife and fork, and looked at me, not saying anything, but waiting for me to say more, and yet did not show so much surprise as I expected. Then I reminded him how the old merchant's face was full of wonder and delight when first he saw the stone, which showed he thought it was real then, and how afterwards, though he schooled his voice to bring out long words to deceive us, he was ready enough to spring to his feet and shriek out loud when Elzevir threw the stone into the garden. I spoke fast, and in talking to him convinced myself, so when I stopped for want of breath I was quite sure that the stone was indeed a diamond, and that Aldobrand had duped us.\n\nStill Elzevir showed little eagerness, and only said--\n\n''Tis like enough that what you say is true, but what would you have us do? The stone is flung away.'\n\n'Yes,' I answered; 'but I saw where it fell, and know the very place; let us go back now at once and get it.'\n\n'Do you not think that Aldobrand saw the place too?' asked Elzevir; and then I remembered how, when I turned back to the room after seeing the stone fall, I caught the eyes of the old merchant looking the same way; and how he spoke more quietly after that, and not with the bitter cry he used when Elzevir tossed the jewel out of the window.\n\n'I do not know,' I said doubtfully; 'let us go back and see. It fell just by the stem of a red flower that I marked well. What!' I added, seeing him still hesitate and draw back, 'do you doubt? Shall we not go and get it?'\n\nStill he did not answer for a minute, and then spoke slowly, as if weighing his words. 'I cannot tell. I think that all you say is true, and that this stone is real. Nay, I was half of that mind when I threw it away, and yet I would not say we are not best without it. 'Twas you who first spoke of a curse upon the jewel, and I laughed at that as being a childish tale. But now I cannot tell; for ever since we first scented this treasure luck has run against us, John; yes, run against us very strong; and here we are, flying from home, called outlaws, and with blood upon our hands. Not that blood frightens me, for I have stood face to face with men in fair fight, and never felt a death-blow given so weigh on my soul; but these two men came to a tricksy kind of end, and yet I could not help it. 'Tis true that all my life I've served the Contraband, but no man ever knew me do a foul action; and now I do not like that men should call me felon, and like it less that they should call thee felon too. Perhaps there may be after all some curse that hangs about this stone, and leads to ruin those that handle it. I cannot say, for I am not a Parson Glennie in these things; but Blackbeard in an evil mood may have tied the treasure up to be a curse to any that use it for themselves. What do we want with this thing at all? I have got money to be touched at need; we may lie quiet this side the Channel, where thou shalt learn an honest trade, and when the mischief has blown over we will go back to Moonfleet. So let the jewel be, John; shall we not let the jewel be?'\n\nHe spoke earnestly, and most earnestly at the end, taking me by the hand and looking me full in the face. But I could not look him back again, and turned my eyes away, for I was wilful, and would not bring myself to let the diamond go. Yet all the while I thought that what he said was true, and I remembered that sermon that Mr. Glennie preached, saying that life was like a 'Y', and that to each comes a time when two ways part, and where he must choose whether he will take the broad and sloping road or the steep and narrow path. So now I guessed that long ago I had chosen the broad road, and now was but walking farther down it in seeking after this evil treasure, and still I could not bear to give all up, and persuaded myself that it was a child's folly to madly fling away so fine a stone. So instead of listening to good advice from one so much older than me, I set to work to talk him over, and persuaded him that if we got the diamond again, and ever could sell it, we would give the money to build up the Mohune almshouses, knowing well in my heart that I never meant to do any such thing. Thus at the last Elzevir, who was the stubbornest of men, and never yielded, was overborne by his great love to me, and yielded here.",
    "It was ten o'clock before we set out together, to go again to Aldobrand's, meaning to climb the garden wall and get the stone. I walked quickly enough, and talked all the time to silence my own misgivings, but Elzevir hung back a little and said nothing, for it was sorely against his judgement that he came at all. But as we neared the place I ceased my chatter, and so we went on in silence, each busy with his own thoughts. We did not come in front of Aldobrand's house, but turned out of the main street down a side lane which we guessed would skirt the garden wall. There were few people moving even in the streets, and in this little lane there was not a soul to meet as we crept along in the shadow of the high walls. We were not mistaken, for soon we came to what we judged was the outside of Aldobrand's garden.\n\nHere we paused for a minute, and I believe Elzevir was for making a last remonstrance, but I gave him no chance, for I had found a place where some bricks were loosened in the wall-face, and set myself to climb. It was easy enough to scale for us, and in a minute we both dropped down in a bed of soft mould on the other side. We pushed through some gooseberry-bushes that caught the clothes, and distinguishing the outline of the house, made that way, till in a few steps we stood on the _Pelouse_ or turf, which I had seen from the balcony three hours before. I knew the twirl of the walks, and the pattern of the beds; the rank of hollyhocks that stood up all along the wall, and the poppies breathing out a faint sickly odour in the night. An utter silence held all the garden, and, the night being very clear, there was still enough light to show the colours of the flowers when one looked close at them, though the green of the leaves was turned to grey. We kept in the shadow of the wall, and looked expectantly at the house. But no murmur came from it, it might have been a house of the dead for any noise the living made there; nor was there light in any window, except in one behind the balcony, to which our eyes were turned first. In that room there was someone not yet gone to rest, for we could see a lattice of light where a lamp shone through the open work of the wooden blinds.\n\n'He is up still,' I whispered, 'and the outside shutters are not closed.' Elzevir nodded, and then I made straight for the bed where the red flower grew. I had no need of any light to see the bells of that great rushy thing, for it was different from any of the rest, and besides that was planted by itself.\n\nI pointed it out to Elzevir. 'The stone lies by the stalk of that flower,' I said, 'on the side nearest to the house'; and then I stayed him with my hand upon his arm, that he should stand where he was at the bed's edge, while I stepped on and got the stone.\n\nMy feet sank in the soft earth as I passed through the fringe of poppies circling the outside of the bed, and so I stood beside the tall rushy flower. The scarlet of its bells was almost black, but there was no mistaking it, and I stooped to pick the diamond up. Was it possible? was there nothing for my outstretched hand to finger, except the soft rich loam, and on the darkness of the ground no guiding sparkle? I knelt down to make more sure, and looked all round the plant, and still found nothing, though it was light enough to see a pebble, much more to catch the gleam and flash of the great diamond I knew so well.\n\nIt was not there, and yet I knew that I had seen it fall beyond all room for doubt. 'It is gone, Elzevir; it is gone!' I cried out in my anguish, but only heard a 'Hush!' from him to bid me not to speak so loud. Then I fell on my knees again, and sifted the mould through my fingers, to make sure the stone had not sunk in and been overlooked.\n\nBut it was all to no purpose, and at last I stepped back to where Elzevir was, and begged him to light a piece of match in the shelter of the hollyhocks; and I would screen it with my hands, so that the light should fall upon the ground, and not be seen from the house, and so search round the flower. He did as I asked, not because he thought that I should find anything, but rather to humour me; and, as he put the lighted match into my hands, said, speaking low, 'Let the stone be, lad, let it be; for either thou didst fail to mark the place right, or others have been here before thee. 'Tis ruled we should not touch the stone again, and so 'tis best; let be, let be; let us get home.'\n\nHe put his hand upon my shoulder gently, and spoke with such an earnestness and pleading in his voice that one would have thought it was a woman rather than a great rough giant; and yet I would not hear, and broke away, sheltering the match in my hollowed hands, and making back to the red flower. But this time, just as I stepped upon the mould, coming to the bed from the house side, the light fell on the ground, and there I saw something that brought me up short.\n\nIt was but a dint or impress on the soft brown loam, and yet, before my eyes were well upon it, I knew it for the print of a sharp heel--a sharp deep heel, having just in front of it the outline of a little foot. There is a story every boy was given to read when I was young, of Crusoe wrecked upon a desert isle, who, walking one day on the shore, was staggered by a single footprint in the sand, because he learnt thus that there were savages in that sad place, where he thought he stood alone. Yet I believe even that footprint in the sand was never greater blow to him than was this impress in the garden mould to me, for I remembered well the little shoes of polished leather, with their silver buckles and high-tilted heels.\n\nHe _had_ been here before us. I found another footprint, and another leading towards the middle of the bed; and then I flung the match away, trampling the fire out in the soil. It was no use searching farther now, for I knew well there was no diamond here for us.\n\nI stepped back to the lawn, and caught Elzevir by the arm. 'Aldobrand has been here before us, and stole away the jewel,' I whispered sharp; and looking wildly round in the still night, saw the lattice of lamplight shining through the wooden blinds of the balcony window.\n\n'Well, there's an end of it!' said he, 'and we are saved further question. 'Tis gone, so let us cry good riddance to it and be off.' So he turned to go back, and there was one more chance for me to choose the better way and go with him; but still I could not give the jewel up, and must go farther on the other path which led to ruin for us both. For I had my eyes fixed on the light coming through the blinds of that window, and saw how thick and strong the boughs of the pear-tree were trained against the wall about the balcony.\n\n'Elzevir,' I said, swallowing the bitter disappointment which rose in my throat, 'I cannot go till I have seen what is doing in that room above. I will climb to the balcony and look in through the chinks. Perhaps he is not there, perhaps he has left our diamond there and we may get it back again.' So I went straight to the house, not giving him time to raise a word to stop me, for there was something in me driving me on, and I was not to be stopped by anyone from that purpose.\n\nThere was no need to fear any seeing us, for all the windows except that one, were tight shuttered, and though our footsteps on the soft lawn woke no sound, I knew that Elzevir was following me. It was no easy task to climb the pear-tree, for all that the boughs looked so strong, for they lay close against the wall, and gave little hold for hand or foot. Twice, or more, an unripe pear was broken off, and fell rustling down through the leaves to earth, and I paused and waited to hear if anyone was disturbed in the room above; but all was deathly still, and at last I got my hand upon the parapet, and so came safe to the balcony.\n\nI was panting from the hard climb, yet did not wait to get my breath, but made straight for the window to see what was going on inside. The outer shutters were still flung back, as they had been in the afternoon, and there was no difficulty in looking in, for I found an opening in the lattice-blind just level with my eyes, and could see all the room inside. It was well lit, as for a marriage feast, and I think there were a score of candles or more burning in holders on the table, or in sconces on the wall. At the table, on the farther side of it from me, and facing the window, sat Aldobrand, just as he sat when he told us the stone was a sham. His face was turned towards the window, and as I looked full at him it seemed impossible but that he should know that I was there.\n\nIn front of him, on the table, lay the diamond--our diamond, my diamond; for I knew it was a diamond now, and not false. It was not alone, but had a dozen more cut gems laid beside it on the table, each a little apart from the other; yet there was no mistaking mine, which was thrice as big as any of the rest. And if it surpassed them in size, how much more did it excel in fierceness and sparkle! All the candles in the room were mirrored in it, and as the splendour flashed from every line and facet that I knew so well, it seemed to call to me, 'Am I not queen of all diamonds of the world? am I not your diamond? will you not take me to yourself again? will you save me from this sorry trickster?'\n\nI had my eyes fixed, but still knew that Elzevir was beside me. He would not let me risk myself in any hazard alone without he stood by me himself to help in case of need; and yet his faithfulness but galled me now, and I asked myself with a sneer, Am I never to stir hand or foot without this man to dog me? The merchant sat still for a minute as though thinking, and then he took one of the diamonds that lay on the table, and then another, and set them close beside the great stone, pitting them, as it were, with it. Yet how could any match with that?--for it outshone them all as the sun outshines the stars in heaven.",
    "The ship that was to carry us swung at the buoy a quarter of a mile offshore, and there were row-boats waiting to take us to her. She was a brig of some 120 tons burthen, and as we came under the stern I saw her name was the _Aurungzebe_.\n\n'Twas with regret unspeakable I took my last look at Europe; and casting my eyes round saw the smoke of the town dark against the darkening sky; yet knew that neither smoke nor sky was half as black as was the prospect of my life.\n\nThey sent us down to the orlop or lowest deck, a foul place where was no air nor light, and shut the hatches down on top of us. There were thirty of us all told, hustled and driven like pigs into this deck, which was to be our pigsty for six months or more. Here was just light enough, when they had the hatches off, to show us what sort of place it was, namely, as foul as it smelt, with never table, seat, nor anything, but roughest planks and balks; and there they changed our bonds, taking away the bar, and putting a tight bracelet round one wrist, with a padlocked chain running through a loop on it. Thus we were still ironed, six together, but had a greater freedom and more scope to move. And more than this, the man who shifted the chains, whether through caprice, or perhaps because he really wished to show us what pity he might, padlocked me on to the same chain with Elzevir, saying, we were English swine and might sink or swim together. Then the hatches were put on, and there they left us in the dark to think or sleep or curse the time away. The weariness of Ymeguen was bad indeed, and yet it was a heaven to this night of hell, where all we had to look for was twice a day the moving of the hatches, and half an hour's glimmer of a ship's lantern, while they served us out the broken victuals that the Dutch crew would not eat.\n\nI shall say nothing of the foulness of this place, because 'twas too foul to be written on paper; and if 'twas foul at starting, 'twas ten times worse when we reached open sea, for of all the prisoners only Elzevir and I were sailors, and the rest took the motion unkindly.\n\nFrom the first we made bad weather of it, for though we were below and could see nothing, yet 'twas easy enough to tell there was a heavy head-sea running, almost as soon as we were well out of harbour. Although Elzevir and I had not had any chance of talking freely for so long, and were now able to speak as we liked, being linked so close together, we said but little. And this, not because we did not value very greatly one another's company, but because we had nothing to talk of except memories of the past, and those were too bitter, and came too readily to our minds, to need any to summon them. There was, too, the banishment from Europe, from all and everything we loved, and the awful certainty of slavery that lay continuously on us like a weight of lead. Thus we said little.\n\nWe had been out a week, I think--for time is difficult enough to measure where there is neither clock nor sun nor stars--when the weather, which had moderated a little, began to grow much worse. The ship plunged and laboured heavily, and this added much to our discomfort; because there was nothing to hold on by, and unless we lay flat on the filthy deck, we ran a risk of being flung to the side whenever there came a more violent lurch or roll. Though we were so deep down, yet the roaring of wind and wave was loud enough to reach us, and there was such a noise when the ship went about, such grinding of ropes, with creaking and groaning of timbers, as would make a landsman fear the brig was going to pieces. And this some of our fellow-prisoners feared indeed, and fell to crying, or kneeling chained together as they were upon the sloping deck, while they tried to remember long-forgotten prayers. For my own part, I wondered why these poor wretches should pray to be delivered from the sea, when all that was before them was lifelong slavery; but I was perhaps able to look more calmly on the matter myself as having been at sea, and not thinking that the vessel was going to founder because of the noise. Yet the storm rose till 'twas very plain that we were in a raging sea, and the streams which began to trickle through the joinings of the hatch showed that water had got below.\n\n'I have known better ships go under for less than this,' Elzevir said to me; 'and if our skipper hath not a tight craft, and stout hands to work her, there will soon be two score slaves the less to cut the canes in Java. I cannot guess where we are now--may be off Ushant, may be not so far, for this sea is too short for the Bay; but the saints send us sea-room, for we have been wearing these three hours.'\n\n'Twas true enough that we had gone to wearing, as one might tell from the heavier roll or wallowing when we went round, instead of the plunging of a tack; but there was no chance of getting at our whereabouts. The only thing we had to reckon time withal, was the taking off of the hatch twice a day for food; and even this poor clock kept not the hour too well, for often there were such gaps and intervals as made our bellies pine, and at this present we had waited so long that I craved even that filthy broken meat they fed us with.\n\nSo we were glad enough to hear a noise at the hatch just as Elzevir had done speaking, and the cover was flung off, letting in a splash of salt water and a little dim and dusky light. But instead of the guard with their muskets and lanterns and the tubs of broken victuals, there was only one man, and that the jailer who had padlocked us into gangs at the beginning of the voyage.\n\nHe bent down for a moment over the hatch, holding on to the combing to steady himself in the sea-way, and flung a key on a chain down into the orlop, right among us. 'Take it,' he shouted in Dutch, 'and make the most of it. God helps the brave, and the devil takes the hindmost.'\n\nThat said, he stayed not one moment, but turned about quick and was gone. For an instant none knew what this play portended, and there was the key lying on the deck, and the hatch left open. Then Elzevir saw what it all meant, and seized the key. 'John,' cries he, speaking to me in English, 'the ship is foundering, and they are giving us a chance to save our lives, and not drown like rats in a trap.' With that he tried the key on the padlock which held our chain, and it fitted so well that in a trice our gang was free. Off fell the chain clanking on the floor, and nothing left of our bonds but an iron bracelet clamped round the left wrist. You may be sure the others were quick enough to make use of the key when they knew what 'twas, but we waited not to see more, but made for the ladder.\n\nNow Elzevir and I, being used to the sea, were first through the hatchway above, and oh, the strength and sweet coolness of the sea air, instead of the warm, fetid reek of the orlop below! There was a good deal of water sousing about on the main deck, but nothing to show the ship was sinking, yet none of the crew was to be seen. We stayed there not a second, but moved to the companion as fast as we could for the heavy pitching of the ship, and so came on deck."

  "H. Rider Haggard -- Hunter Quatermain's Story": [
    "Sir Henry Curtis, as everybody acquainted with him knows, is one of the most hospitable men on earth. It was in the course of the enjoyment of his hospitality at his place in Yorkshire the other day that I heard the hunting story which I am now about to transcribe. Many of those who read it will no doubt have heard some of the strange rumours that are flying about to the effect that Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good, R.N., recently found a vast treasure of diamonds out in the heart of Africa, supposed to have been hidden by the Egyptians, or King Solomon, or some other antique people. I first saw the matter alluded to in a paragraph in one of the society papers the day before I started for Yorkshire to pay my visit to Curtis, and arrived, needless to say, burning with curiosity; for there is something very fascinating to the mind in the idea of hidden treasure. When I reached the Hall, I at once asked Curtis about it, and he did not deny the truth of the story; but on my pressing him to tell it he would not, nor would Captain Good, who was also staying in the house.\n\n\"You would not believe me if I did,\" Sir Henry said, with one of the hearty laughs which seem to come right out of his great lungs. \"You must wait till Hunter Quatermain comes; he will arrive here from Africa to-night, and I am not going to say a word about the matter, or Good either, until he turns up. Quatermain was with us all through; he has known about the business for years and years, and if it had not been for him we should not have been here to-day. I am going to meet him presently.\"\n\nI could not get a word more out of him, nor could anybody else, though we were all dying of curiosity, especially some of the ladies. I shall never forget how they looked in the drawing-room before dinner when Captain Good produced a great rough diamond, weighing fifty carats or more, and told them that he had many larger than that. If ever I saw curiosity and envy printed on fair faces, I saw them then.\n\nIt was just at this moment that the door was opened, and Mr. Allan Quatermain announced, whereupon Good put the diamond into his pocket, and sprang at a little man who limped shyly into the room, convoyed by Sir Henry Curtis himself.\n\n\"Here he is, Good, safe and sound,\" said Sir Henry, gleefully. \"Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of the oldest hunters and the very best shot in Africa, who has killed more elephants and lions than any other man alive.\"\n\nEverybody turned and stared politely at the curious-looking little lame man, and though his size was insignificant, he was quite worth staring at. He had short grizzled hair, which stood about an inch above his head like the bristles of a brush, gentle brown eyes, that seemed to notice everything, and a withered face, tanned to the colour of mahogany from exposure to the weather. He spoke, too, when he returned Good's enthusiastic greeting, with a curious little accent, which made his speech noticeable.\n\nIt so happened that I sat next to Mr. Allan Quatermain at dinner, and, of course, did my best to draw him; but he was not to be drawn. He admitted that he had recently been a long journey into the interior of Africa with Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good, and that they had found treasure, and then politely turned the subject and began to ask me questions about England, where he had never been before--that is, since he came to years of discretion. Of course, I did not find this very interesting, and so cast about for some means to bring the conversation round again.\n\nNow, we were dining in an oak-panelled vestibule, and on the wall opposite to me were fixed two gigantic elephant tusks, and under them a pair of buffalo horns, very rough and knotted, showing that they came off an old bull, and having the tip of one horn split and chipped. I noticed that Hunter Quatermain's eyes kept glancing at these trophies, and took an occasion to ask him if he knew anything about them.\n\n\"I ought to,\" he answered, with a little laugh; \"the elephant to which those tusks belonged tore one of our party right in two about eighteen months ago, and as for the buffalo horns, they were nearly my death, and were the end of a servant of mine to whom I was much attached. I gave them to Sir Henry when he left Natal some months ago;\" and Mr. Quatermain sighed and turned to answer a question from the lady whom he had taken down to dinner, and who, needless to say, was also employed in trying to pump him about the diamonds.\n\nIndeed, all round the table there was a simmer of scarcely suppressed excitement, which, when the servants had left the room, could no longer be restrained.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Quatermain,\" said the lady next him, \"we have been kept in an agony of suspense by Sir Henry and Captain Good, who have persistently refused to tell us a word of this story about the hidden treasure till you came, and we simply can bear it no longer; so, please, begin at once.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said everybody, \"go on, please.\"\n\nHunter Quatermain glanced round the table apprehensively; he did not seem to appreciate finding himself the object of so much curiosity.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said at last, with a shake of his grizzled head, \"I am very sorry to disappoint you, but I cannot do it. It is this way. At the request of Sir Henry and Captain Good I have written down a true and plain account of King Solomon's Mines and how we found them, so you will soon be able to learn all about that wonderful adventure for yourselves; but until then I will say nothing about it, not from any wish to disappoint your curiosity, or to make myself important, but simply because the whole story partakes so much of the marvellous, that I am afraid to tell it in a piecemeal, hasty fashion, for fear I should be set down as one of those common fellows of whom there are so many in my profession, who are not ashamed to narrate things they have not seen, and even to tell wonderful stories about wild animals they have never killed. And I think that my companions in adventure, Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good, will bear me out in what I say.\"\n\n\"Yes, Quatermain, I think you are quite right,\" said Sir Henry. \"Precisely the same considerations have forced Good and myself to hold our tongues. We did not wish to be bracketed with--well, with other famous travellers.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of disappointment at these announcements.\n\n\"I believe you are all hoaxing us,\" said the young lady next Mr. Quatermain, rather sharply.\n\n\"Believe me,\" answered the old hunter, with a quaint courtesy and a little bow of his grizzled head; \"though I have lived all my life in the wilderness, and amongst savages, I have neither the heart, nor the want of manners, to wish to deceive one so lovely.\"\n\nWhereat the young lady, who was pretty, looked appeased.\n\n\"This is very dreadful,\" I broke in. \"We ask for bread and you give us a stone, Mr. Quatermain. The least that you can do is to tell us the story of the tusks opposite and the buffalo horns underneath. We won't let you off with less.\"\n\n\"I am but a poor story-teller,\" put in the old hunter, \"but if you will forgive my want of skill, I shall be happy to tell you, not the story of the tusks, for that is part of the history of our journey to King Solomon's Mines, but that of the buffalo horns beneath them, which is now ten years old.\"",
    "\"Well,\" I said, \"I have lived a long life, and seen many strange things, but this is the strangest. What do you make of it all, Curtis?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Quatermain,\" he answered, \"I don't know what to make of it. For my part, I incline to the opinion that this is the treasure chamber where Solomon really deposited his wealth, and that the inscription refers to him.\"\n\n\"Do you, now?\" I said. \"Well, I don't. I think that it was some other king who went by the title of Solomon, as many did in old days. Look here, what does that inscription say? 'From the hand of Twala the king, I, Gagool the old, took the treasure, while he slept, and hid it here. Let him who finds it beware.' Now, I think that Twala was the Solomon who made these mines, and that this Gagool was his witch or priestess, who stole the treasure and hid it here, probably after Twala's death, and for her own purposes. Look, here are the remains of her. No doubt she was starved to death after she had hidden the treasure, for no one could ever have got out of this place unless they knew the secret of the door.\"\n\n\"You may be right,\" said Sir Henry, \"but for my part I prefer to stick to my own idea, that the real Solomon was the hero of this business; it sounds more romantic.\"\n\nJust then Good, who had been carefully examining the body of the old woman, uttered an exclamation.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he said, \"look here.\"\n\nWe went to him, and he pointed to a little bag which was tied round the old woman's neck.\n\n\"This must have been what she was so careful about,\" he said.\n\nHe cut the string with his knife, and the bag opened. From it he took three bright stones, which we held up to the light of the lamp.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I gasped, \"they are diamonds!\"\n\nThey were diamonds indeed, and such diamonds as I had never seen before. One was blue, and as large as a pigeon's egg; the other two were white, but almost as large. We looked at each other, speechless with astonishment.\n\n\"King Solomon's treasure chamber, in very truth!\" I said at last.\n\n\"Well,\" said Good, \"I suppose we had better make the best of our way out of this ghastly hole now we have got what we came for.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" I answered; \"though for my part I am sorry to leave so much behind.\"\n\n\"Do you really mean to say, Quatermain,\" asked Sir Henry, who was looking thoughtfully at the three gems in his hand, \"that you would not have taken some more if you had had the chance?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Curtis,\" I answered; \"it is difficult to say what one would do in such a case. I am not a very covetous man, and I have reason to be satisfied with my share of the find; still, I think I should have taken some more--a few handfuls or so, to make it even money, you see; but, of course, I would not have taken too many.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Good, \"I am glad to hear you say so, Quatermain, because I also feel rather drawn to those diamonds. What do you say, Curtis? Shall we have a few handfuls just to make it even, as Quatermain proposes?\"\n\nSir Henry smiled.\n\n\"Well, Good,\" he said, \"as you put it in that way, I think perhaps we may as well. It is rather a tempting opportunity. Still, we must not waste time about it. Let us fill our pockets and be off.\"\n\nGood produced a large canvas bag, which he had brought with him, and we all set to work to fill our pockets and the bag with the diamonds. It was a pretty sight to see us filling the bag, I can tell you. We took handfuls of stones at a time, and poured them into the sack like so many potatoes. It was a happy moment for us all, especially for Good, who, by the way, seemed to be particularly anxious to make it even money, and went on working long after the rest of us had got as many diamonds as we could carry.",
    "\"Now for it,\" I said.\n\n\"Stop a moment,\" said Sir Henry; \"what is to become of the old lady?\"\n\nI looked at her grimly, and shook my head.\n\n\"It is awkward,\" I said; \"but, my dear fellow, we must really leave her behind. She will be quite as happy here as anywhere else, I dare say.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose there is no help for it,\" said Sir Henry, with a sigh. \"After all, she was no beauty.\"\n\nSo we left the old lady, together with the diamonds, and proceeded to make the best of our way out of the treasure chamber.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"we must be careful; one false step, and we are done for.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Good, \"we must be careful; but come on.\"\n\nSo we started. I went first, then Sir Henry, and Good last. For about fifty yards we proceeded along the passage, when suddenly it took a sharp turn. We followed it round, and found ourselves in another passage, which, however, instead of running straight, like the first one, sloped gradually downwards. We went down it for some distance without anything particular happening, till at last we reached a spot where the passage took another turn, this time to the left. We went round it, and then I uttered a cry of dismay.\n\n\"Great heavens!\" I said, \"the passage is blocked up!\"\n\nIt was so. Right in front of us was a solid wall of rock.\n\n\"We are done for!\" groaned Good.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Sir Henry; \"Quatermain, surely there is some way out of this.\"\n\nI examined the wall carefully.\n\n\"There is a way,\" I said at last, \"but I doubt if we can manage it. Do you see that crack?\" and I pointed to a thin crack which ran down the face of the rock. \"Well, I think that if we could get up there we might be able to squeeze through into the passage beyond. But the question is, how are we to get up there?\"\n\n\"I'll show you,\" said Good. \"Give me a back, Quatermain, and I think I can manage it.\"\n\nI stooped down, and Good got on my back. Then he made a spring, and caught hold of a projecting piece of rock with his hands. Next he put his foot on my shoulder, and in another second he was up on a little ledge about three feet above us.\n\n\"Now, Curtis,\" he said, \"give me your hand.\"\n\nSir Henry did so, and in a moment he was beside Good.\n\n\"Now, Quatermain,\" said Sir Henry, \"it is your turn.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I answered; \"only be careful that you don't let go.\"\n\nThey both stooped down and gave me their hands, and with their assistance I was soon beside them.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, \"let us try and squeeze through that crack.\"\n\nIt was a tight fit, but at last we managed it, and found ourselves in another passage. This passage, however, was not like the others. It was very narrow, and sloped upwards at a steep angle. We went up it for some distance, and then it suddenly widened out into a cave.\n\n\"Thank goodness!\" I said, \"we are out of that beastly hole at last.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Good, \"and I for one don't want to go into another in a hurry.\"\n\nWe were now in a large cave, and after we had been in it for a few minutes we began to hear a curious humming sound.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Sir Henry.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I answered; \"but I don't like the sound of it.\"\n\nThe humming sound grew louder and louder, and at last it seemed to be all round us. Then suddenly the cave began to grow light, and in another second we saw what the humming sound meant. We were in a vast nest of bees, and the bees were swarming all round us.\n\n\"Run for your lives!\" I shouted, and we all turned and fled back along the passage.",
    "\"We had been travelling for about a month, living and getting along as best we could, when one evening we camped some forty miles from Bamangwato. By this time we were indeed in a melancholy plight, footsore, half starved, and utterly worn out; and, in addition, I was suffering from a sharp attack of fever, which half blinded me and made me weak as a babe. Our ammunition, too, was exhausted; I had only one cartridge left for my eight-bore rifle, and Hans and Mashune, who were armed with Martini Henrys, had three between them. It was about an hour from sundown when we halted and lit a fire--for luckily we had still a few matches. It was a charming spot to camp, I remember. Just off the game track we were following was a little hollow, fringed about with flat-crowned mimosa trees, and at the bottom of the hollow, a spring of clear water welled up out of the earth, and formed a pool, round the edges of which grew an abundance of watercresses of an exactly similar kind to those which were handed round the table just now. Now we had no food of any kind left, having that morning devoured the last remains of a little orib\u00e9 antelope, which I had shot two days previously. Accordingly Hans, who was a better shot than Mashune, took two of the three remaining Martini cartridges, and started out to see if he could not kill a buck for supper. I was too weak to go myself.\n\nMeanwhile Mashune employed himself in dragging together some dead boughs from the mimosa trees to make a sort of 'skerm,' or shelter for us to sleep in, about forty yards from the edge of the pool of water. We had been greatly troubled with lions in the course of our long tramp, and only on the previous night have very nearly been attacked by them, which made me nervous, especially in my weak state. Just as we had finished the skerm, or rather something which did duty for one, Mashune and I heard a shot apparently fired about a mile away.\n\n'Hark to it!' sung out Mashune in Zulu, more, I fancy, by way of keeping his spirits up than for any other reason--for he was a sort of black Mark Tapley, and very cheerful under difficulties. 'Hark to the wonderful sound with which the \"Maboona\" (the Boers) shook our fathers to the ground at the Battle of the Blood River. We are hungry now, my father; our stomachs are small and withered up like a dried ox's paunch, but they will soon be full of good meat. Hans is a Hottentot, and an \"umfagozan,\" that is, a low fellow, but he shoots straight--ah! he certainly shoots straight. Be of a good heart, my father, there will soon be meat upon the fire, and we shall rise up men.'\n\nAnd so he went on talking nonsense till I told him to stop, because he made my head ache with his empty words.\n\nShortly after we heard the shot the sun sank in his red splendour, and there fell upon earth and sky the great hush of the African wilderness. The lions were not up as yet, they would probably wait for the moon, and the birds and beasts were all at rest. I cannot describe the intensity of the quiet of the night: to me in my weak state, and fretting as I was over the non-return of the Hottentot Hans, it seemed almost ominous--as though Nature were brooding over some tragedy which was being enacted in her sight.\n\nIt was quiet--quiet as death, and lonely as the grave.\"",
    "\"'Mashune,' I said at last, 'where is Hans? my heart is heavy for him.'\n\n\"'Nay, my father, I know not; mayhap he is weary, and sleeps, or mayhap he has lost his way.'\n\n\"'Mashune, art thou a boy to talk folly to me?' I answered. 'Tell me, in all the years thou hast hunted by my side, didst thou ever know a Hottentot to lose his path or to sleep upon the way to camp?'\n\n\"'Nay, Macumazahn' (that, ladies, is my native name, and means the man who 'gets up by night,' or who 'is always awake'), 'I know not where he is.'\n\nBut though we talked thus, we neither of us liked to hint at what was in both our minds, namely, that misfortunate had overtaken the poor Hottentot.\n\n\"'Mashune,' I said at last, 'go down to the water and bring me of those green herbs that grow there. I am hungered, and must eat something.'\n\n\"'Nay, my father; surely the ghosts are there; they come out of the water at night, and sit upon the banks to dry themselves. An Isanusi[*] told it me.'\n\n[*] _Isanusi_, witch-finder.\n\nMashune was, I think, one of the bravest men I ever knew in the daytime, but he had a more than civilized dread of the supernatural.\n\n\"'Must I go myself, thou fool?' I said, sternly.\n\n\"'Nay, Macumazahn, if thy heart yearns for strange things like a sick woman, I go, even if the ghosts devour me.'\n\nAnd accordingly he went, and soon returned with a large bundle of watercresses, of which I ate greedily.\n\n\"'Art thou not hungry?' I asked the great Zulu presently, as he sat eyeing me eating.\n\n\"'Never was I hungrier, my father.'\n\n\"'Then eat,' and I pointed to the watercresses.\n\n\"'Nay, Macumazahn, I cannot eat those herbs.'\n\n\"'If thou dost not eat thou wilt starve: eat, Mashune.'\n\nHe stared at the watercresses doubtfully for a while, and at last seized a handful and crammed them into his mouth, crying out as he did so, 'Oh, why was I born that I should live to feed on green weeds like an ox? Surely if my mother could have known it she would have killed me when I was born!' and so he went on lamenting between each fistful of watercresses till all were finished, when he declared that he was full indeed of stuff, but it lay very cold on his stomach, 'like snow upon a mountain.' At any other time I should have laughed, for it must be admitted he had a ludicrous way of putting things. Zulus do not like green food.\n\nJust after Mashune had finished his watercress, we heard the loud 'woof! woof!' of a lion, who was evidently promenading much nearer to our little skerm than was pleasant. Indeed, on looking into the darkness and listening intently, I could hear his snoring breath, and catch the light of his great yellow eyes. We shouted loudly, and Mashune threw some sticks on the fire to frighten him, which apparently had the desired effect, for we saw no more of him for a while.\"",
    "\"Just after we had had this fright from the lion, the moon rose in her fullest splendour, throwing a robe of silver light over all the earth. I have rarely seen a more beautiful moonrise. I remember that sitting in the skerm I could with ease read faint pencil notes in my pocket-book. As soon as the moon was up game began to trek down to the water just below us. I could, from where I sat, see all sorts of them passing along a little ridge that ran to our right, on their way to the drinking place. Indeed, one buck--a large eland--came within twenty yards of the skerm, and stood at gaze, staring at it suspiciously, his beautiful head and twisted horns standing out clearly against the sky. I had, I recollect, every mind to have a pull at him on the chance of providing ourselves with a good supply of beef; but remembering that we had but two cartridges left, and the extreme uncertainty of a shot by moonlight, I at length decided to refrain. The eland presently moved on to the water, and a minute or two afterwards there arose a great sound of splashing, followed by the quick fall of galloping hoofs.\n\n\"'What's that, Mashune?' I asked.\n\n\"'That dam lion; buck smell him,' replied the Zulu in English, of which he had a very superficial knowledge.\n\nScarcely were the words out of his mouth before we heard a sort of whine over the other side of the pool, which was instantly answered by a loud coughing roar close to us.\n\n\"'By Jove!' I said, 'there are two of them. They have lost the buck; we must look out they don't catch us.' And again we made up the fire, and shouted, with the result that the lions moved off.\n\n\"'Mashune,' I said, 'do you watch till the moon gets over that tree, when it will be the middle of the night. Then wake me. Watch well, now, or the lions will be picking those worthless bones of yours before you are three hours older. I must rest a little, or I shall die.'\n\n\"'Koos!' (chief), answered the Zulu. 'Sleep, my father, sleep in peace; my eyes shall be open as the stars; and like the stars watch over you.'\n\nAlthough I was so weak, I could not at once follow his advice. To begin with, my head ached with fever, and I was torn with anxiety as to the fate of the Hottentot Hans; and, indeed, as to our own fate, left with sore feet, empty stomachs, and two cartridges, to find our way to Bamangwato, forty miles off. Then the mere sensation of knowing that there are one or more hungry lions prowling round you somewhere in the dark is disquieting, however well one may be used to it, and, by keeping the attention on the stretch, tends to prevent one from sleeping. In addition to all these troubles, too, I was, I remember, seized with a dreadful longing for a pipe of tobacco, whereas, under the circumstances, I might as well have longed for the moon.\n\nAt last, however, I fell into an uneasy sleep as full of bad dreams as a prickly pear is of points, one of which, I recollect, was that I was setting my naked foot upon a cobra which rose upon its tail and hissed my name, 'Macumazahn,' into my ear. Indeed, the cobra hissed with such persistency that at last I roused myself.\n\n\"'_Macumazahn, nanzia, nanzia!_' (there, there!) whispered Mashune's voice into my drowsy ears. Raising myself, I opened my eyes, and I saw Mashune kneeling by my side and pointing towards the water. Following the line of his outstretched hand, my eyes fell upon a sight that made me jump, old hunter as I was even in those days. About twenty paces from the little skerm was a large ant-heap, and on the summit of the ant-heap, her four feet rather close together, so as to find standing space, stood the massive form of a big lioness. Her head was towards the skerm, and in the bright moonlight I saw her lower it and lick her paws.\n\nMashune thrust the Martini rifle into my hands, whispering that it was loaded. I lifted it and covered the lioness, but found that even in that light I could not make out the foresight of the Martini. As it would be madness to fire without doing so, for the result would probably be that I should wound the lioness, if, indeed, I did not miss her altogether, I lowered the rifle; and, hastily tearing a fragment of paper from one of the leaves of my pocket-book, which I had been consulting just before I went to sleep, I proceeded to fix it on to the front sight. But all this took a little time, and before the paper was satisfactorily arranged, Mashune again gripped me by the arm, and pointed to a dark heap under the shade of a small mimosa tree which grew not more than ten paces from the skerm.\n\n\"'Well, what is it?' I whispered; 'I can see nothing.'\n\n\"'It is another lion,' he answered.\n\n\"'Nonsense! thy heart is dead with fear, thou seest double;' and I bent forward over the edge of the surrounding fence, and stared at the heap.\n\nEven as I said the words, the dark mass rose and stalked out into the moonlight. It was a magnificent, black-maned lion, one of the largest I had ever seen. When he had gone two or three steps he caught sight of me, halted, and stood there gazing straight towards us;--he was so close that I could see the firelight reflected in his wicked, greenish eyes.\n\n\"'Shoot, shoot!' said Mashune. 'The devil is coming--he is going to spring!'\n\nI raised the rifle, and got the bit of paper on the foresight, straight on to a little path of white hair just where the throat is set into the chest and shoulders. As I did so, the lion glanced back over his shoulder, as, according to my experience, a lion nearly always does before he springs. Then he dropped his body a little, and I saw his big paws spread out upon the ground as he put his weight on them to gather purchase. In haste I pressed the trigger of the Martini, and not a moment too soon; for, as I did so, he was in the act of springing. The report of the rifle rang out sharp and clear on the intense silence of the night, and in another second the great brute had landed on his head within four feet of us, and rolling over and over towards us, was sending the bushes which composed our little fence flying with convulsive strokes of his great paws. We sprang out of the other side of the 'skerm,' and he rolled on to it and into it and then right through the fire. Next he raised himself and sat upon his haunches like a great dog, and began to roar. Heavens! how he roared! I never heard anything like it before or since. He kept filling his lungs with air, and then emitting it in the most heart-shaking volumes of sound. Suddenly, in the middle of one of the loudest roars, he rolled over on to his side and lay still, and I knew that he was dead. A lion generally dies upon his side.\n\nWith a sigh of relief I looked up towards his mate upon the ant-heap. She was standing there apparently petrified with astonishment, looking over her shoulder, and lashing her tail; but to our intense joy, when the dying beast ceased roaring, she turned, and, with one enormous bound, vanished into the night.\"",
    "\"Presently, however, I saw him, about a hundred yards off, standing near the edge of the bush, and evidently watching the water.  He was a magnificent beast, a black-maned lion, and as I watched him he lay down, resting his head upon his outstretched paws.  I could have shot him then, but thought I would wait a bit and get a closer shot.  So I strolled on up the vlei, taking advantage of the inequalities of the ground and of the scattered bushes, till I was within about seventy yards of him.  By this time the moon was getting up, and I could see him beautifully.  He was still lying in the same position, and his great black mane and head looked just like a small rock.  I knelt down and took a steady aim at his shoulder, and was just about to pull when suddenly I heard a noise behind me, and looking round saw a second lion, an enormous brute, even bigger than the black-maned one, and tawny-coloured, stalking along through the grass towards me.  He was not more than forty yards off, and seemed to be making for my back.  I was in a regular fix.  If I fired at the black-maned lion the tawny one would be on to me before I could get the empty cartridge out, and if I did not fire he would be on to me anyhow.  So after a moment's hesitation I decided to risk it and fire at the black-maned one.  I took a hasty aim and fired.  The bullet struck him all right, an inch or two behind the point of the shoulder, and he gave a great roar and bounded into the bush.  At the same moment the other lion, which had evidently heard the shot, stopped and looked round.  I snatched up my second rifle, a single-barrelled '577 Express, and took a snap shot at him.  The bullet struck him full in the chest, and down he went like a stone.  I gave a yell of triumph, and ran forward to look at him, but had not gone a couple of paces when up he jumped again, gave a succession of angry grunts, and bolted into the bush after the other one.  I was determined not to lose him, so, snatching up my rifle, I followed in hot pursuit.  I had gone perhaps a hundred yards or so, guided by his occasional grunts, when suddenly I heard him roar right out in front of me, and the next instant I saw him coming along straight towards me.  He did not seem to be going very fast, but he looked so big and formidable in the uncertain light that I thought it best to get out of his way.  So I bolted to one side, and scrambled up a small mimosa thorn.  He came along right under the tree, and I could have dropped a stone on to his back.  I was just going to fire when suddenly I heard a rustling in the grass behind me, and looking round saw the black-maned lion coming up.  He had evidently been hit hard, for he was dragging his hind leg, and I saw at once that he had come back to help his friend.  I was now in a nice predicament, for I had only one cartridge left, and did not know what to do.  If I fired at the tawny lion the black-maned one would be on to me, and if I did not fire the tawny one would be on to me anyhow.  So after a moment's hesitation I decided to risk it and fire at the black-maned one.  I took a hasty aim and fired.  The bullet struck him about an inch of the white spot I had aimed at, and travelled right through him, passing out at the right buttock, near the root of the tail. The Martini has wonderful driving power, though the shock it gives to the system is, comparatively speaking, slight, owing to the smallness of the hole it makes. But fortunately the lion is an easy beast to kill.\n\n\"I passed the rest of that night in a profound slumber, my head reposing upon the deceased lion's flank, a position that had, I thought, a beautiful touch of irony about it, though the smell of his singed hair was disagreeable. When I woke again the faint primrose lights of dawn were flushing in the eastern sky. For a moment I could not understand the chill sense of anxiety that lay like a lump of ice at my heart, till the feel and smell of the skin of the dead lion beneath my head recalled the circumstances in which we were placed. I rose, and eagerly looked round to see if I could discover any signs of Hans, who, if he had escaped accident, would surely return to us at dawn, but there were none. Then hope grew faint, and I felt that it was not well with the poor fellow. Setting Mashune to build up the fire I hastily removed the hide from the flank of the lion, which was indeed a splendid beast, and cutting off some lumps of flesh, we toasted and ate them greedily. Lions' flesh, strange as it may seem, is very good eating, and tastes more like veal than anything else.\n\n\"By the time we had finished our much-needed meal the sun was getting up, and after a drink of water and a wash at the pool, we started to try and find Hans, leaving the dead lion to the tender mercies of the hy\u00e6nas. Both Mashune and myself were, by constant practice, pretty good hands at tracking, and we had not much difficulty in following the Hottentot's spoor, faint as it was.\"",
    "\"We had gone on in this way for half-an-hour or so, and were, perhaps, a mile or more from the site of our camping-place, when we discovered the spoor of a solitary bull buffalo mixed up with the spoor of Hans, and were able, from various indications, to make out that he had been tracking the buffalo. At length we reached a little glade in which there grew a stunted old mimosa thorn, with a peculiar and overhanging formation of root, under which a porcupine, or an ant-bear, or some such animal, had hollowed out a wide-lipped hole. About ten or fifteen paces from this thorn-tree there was a thick patch of bush.\n\n\"'See, Macumazahn! see!' said Mashune, excitedly, as we drew near the thorn; 'the buffalo has charged him. Look, here he stood to fire at him; see how firmly he planted his feet upon the earth; there is the mark of his crooked toe (Hans had one bent toe). Look! here the bull came like a boulder down the hill, his hoofs turning up the earth like a hoe. Hans had hit him: he bled as he came; there are the blood spots. It is all written down there, my father--there upon the earth.'\n\n\"'Yes,' I said; 'yes; but _where is Hans?_'\n\n\"Even as I said it Mashune clutched my arm, and pointed to the stunted thorn just by us. Even now, gentlemen, it makes me feel sick when I think of what I saw.\n\n\"For fixed in a stout fork of the tree some eight feet from the ground was Hans himself, or rather his dead body, evidently tossed there by the furious buffalo. One leg was twisted round the fork, probably in a dying convulsion. In the side, just beneath the ribs, was a great hole, from which the entrails protruded. But this was not all. The other leg hung down to within five feet of the ground. The skin and most of the flesh were gone from it. For a moment we stood aghast, and gazed at this horrifying sight. Then I understood what had happened. The buffalo, with that devilish cruelty which distinguishes the animal, had, after his enemy was dead, stood underneath his body, and licked the flesh off the pendant leg with his file-like tongue. I had heard of such a thing before, but had always treated the stories as hunters' yarns; but I had no doubt about it now. Poor Hans' skeleton foot and ankle were an ample proof.\n\n\"We stood aghast under the tree, and stared and stared at this awful sight, when suddenly our cogitations were interrupted in a painful manner. The thick bush about fifteen paces off burst asunder with a crashing sound, and uttering a series of ferocious pig-like grunts, the bull buffalo himself came charging out straight at us. Even as he came I saw the blood mark on his side where poor Hans' bullet had struck him, and also, as is often the case with particularly savage buffaloes, that his flanks had recently been terribly torn in an encounter with a lion.\"",
    "\"On he came, his head well up (a buffalo does not generally lower his head till he does so to strike); those great black horns--as I look at them before me, gentlemen, I seem to see them come charging at me as I did ten years ago, silhouetted against the green bush behind;--on, on!\"\n\n\"With a shout Mashune bolted off sideways towards the bush. I had instinctively lifted my eight-bore, which I had in my hand. It would have been useless to fire at the buffalo's head, for the dense horns must have turned the bullet; but as Mashune bolted, the bull slewed a little, with the momentary idea of following him, and as this gave me a ghost of a chance, I let drive my only cartridge at his shoulder. The bullet struck the shoulder-blade and smashed it up, and then travelled on under the skin into his flank; but it did not stop him, though for a second he staggered.\n\n\"Throwing myself on to the ground with the energy of despair, I rolled under the shelter of the projecting root of the thorn, crushing myself as far into the mouth of the ant-bear hole as I could. In a single instant the buffalo was after me. Kneeling down on his uninjured knee--for one leg, that of which I had broken the shoulder, was swinging helplessly to and fro--he set to work to try and hook me out of the hole with his crooked horn. At first he struck at me furiously, and it was one of the blows against the base of the tree which splintered the tip of the horn in the way that you see. Then he grew more cunning, and pushed his head as far under the root as possible, made long semicircular sweeps at me, grunting furiously, and blowing saliva and hot steamy breath all over me. I was just out of reach of the horn, though every stroke, by widening the hole and making more room for his head, brought it closer to me, but every now and again I received heavy blows in the ribs from his muzzle. Feeling that I was being knocked silly, I made an effort and seizing his rough tongue, which was hanging from his jaws, I twisted it with all my force. The great brute bellowed with pain and fury, and jerked himself backwards so strongly, that he dragged me some inches further from the mouth of the hole, and again made a sweep at me, catching me this time round the shoulder-joint in the hook of his horn.\n\n\"I felt that it was all up now, and began to holloa.\n\n\"'He has got me!' I shouted in mortal terror. '_Gwasa, Mashune, gwasa!_' ('Stab, Mashune, stab!').\n\n\"One hoist of the great head, and out of the hole I came like a periwinkle out of his shell. But even as I did so, I caught sight of Mashune's stalwart form advancing with his 'bangwan,' or broad stabbing assegai, raised above his head. In another quarter of a second I had fallen from the horn, and heard the blow of the spear, followed by the indescribable sound of steel shearing its way through flesh. I had fallen on my back, and, looking up, I saw that the gallant Mashune had driven the assegai a foot or more into the carcass of the buffalo, and was turning to fly.\n\n\"Alas! it was too late. Bellowing madly, and spouting blood from mouth and nostrils, the devilish brute was on him, and had thrown him up like a feather, and then gored him twice as he lay. I struggled up with some wild idea of affording help, but before I had gone a step the buffalo gave one long sighing bellow, and rolled over dead by the side of his victim.\n\n\"Mashune was still living, but a single glance at him told me that his hour had come. The buffalo's horn had driven a great hole in his right lung, and inflicted other injuries.\n\n\"I knelt down beside him in the uttermost distress, and took his hand.\n\n\"'Is he dead, Macumazahn?' he whispered. 'My eyes are blind; I cannot see.'\n\n\"'Yes, he is dead.'\n\n\"'Did the black devil hurt thee, Macumazahn?'\n\n\"'No, my poor fellow, I am not much hurt.'\n\n\"'Ow! I am glad.'\n\n\"Then came a long silence, broken only by the sound of the air whistling through the hole in his lung as he breathed.\n\n\"'Macumazahn, art thou there? I cannot feel thee.'\n\n\"'I am here, Mashune.'\n\n\"'I die, Macumazahn--the world flies round and round. I go--I go out into the dark! Surely, my father, at times in days to come--thou wilt think of Mashune who stood by thy side--when thou killest elephants, as we used--as we used----'\n\n\"They were his last words, his brave spirit passed with him. I dragged his body to the hole under the tree, and pushed it in, placing his broad assegai by him, according to the custom of his people, that he might not go defenceless on his long journey; and then, ladies--I am not ashamed to confess--I stood alone there before it, and wept like a woman.\"",

  "Alexandre Dumas and Auguste Maquet -- The three musketeers": [
    "On the first Monday of the month of April, 1625, the market town of Meung, in which the author of _Romance of the Rose_ was born, appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just made a second La Rochelle of it. Many citizens, seeing the women flying toward the High Street, leaving their children crying at the open doors, hastened to don the cuirass, and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan, directed their steps toward the hostelry of the Jolly Miller, before which was gathered, increasing every minute, a compact group, vociferous and full of curiosity. In those times panics were common, and few days passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind. There were nobles, who made war against each other; there was the king, who made war against the cardinal; there was Spain, which made war against the king. Then, in addition to these concealed or public, secret or open wars, there were robbers, mendicants, Huguenots, wolves, and scoundrels, who made war upon everybody. The citizens always took up arms readily against thieves, wolves or scoundrels, often against nobles or Huguenots, sometimes against the king, but never against the cardinal or Spain. It resulted, then, from this habit that on the said first Monday of April, 1625, the citizens, on hearing the clamor, and seeing neither the red-and-yellow standard nor the livery of the Duc de Richelieu, rushed toward the hostel of the Jolly Miller. When arrived there, the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all.\n\nA young man\u2014we can sketch his portrait at a dash. Imagine to yourself a Don Quixote of eighteen; a Don Quixote without his corselet, without his coat of mail, without his cuisses; a Don Quixote clothed in a woolen doublet, the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure; face long and brown; high cheek bones, a sign of sagacity; the maxillary muscles enormously developed, an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected, even without his cap\u2014and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather; the eye open and intelligent; the nose hooked, but finely chiseled. Too big for a youth, too small for a grown man, an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer\u2019s son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which, dangling from a leather baldric, hit against the calves of its owner as he walked, and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback.\n\nFor our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers. It was a B\u00e9arn pony, from twelve to fourteen years old, yellow in his hide, without a hair in his tail, but not without windgalls on his legs, which, though going with his head lower than his knees, rendering a martingale quite unnecessary, contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day. Unfortunately, the qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his strange-colored hide and his unaccountable gait, that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh, the appearance of the aforesaid pony at Meung\u2014which place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before, by the gate of Beaugency\u2014produced an unfavorable feeling, which extended to his rider.\n\nAnd this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young D\u2019Artagnan\u2014for so was the Don Quixote of this second Rosinante named\u2014from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous appearance that such a steed gave him, good horseman as he was. He had sighed deeply, therefore, when accepting the gift of the pony from M. d\u2019Artagnan the elder. He was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres; and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price.\n\n\u201cMy son,\u201d said the old Gascon gentleman, in that pure B\u00e9arn _patois_ of which Henry IV. could never rid himself, \u201cthis horse was born in the house of your father about thirteen years ago, and has remained in it ever since, which ought to make you love it. Never sell it; allow it to die tranquilly and honorably of old age, and if you make a campaign with it, take as much care of it as you would of an old servant. At court, provided you have ever the honor to go there,\u201d continued M. d\u2019Artagnan the elder, \u201c\u2014an honor to which, remember, your ancient nobility gives you the right\u2014sustain worthily your name of gentleman, which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years, both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you. By the latter I mean your relatives and friends. Endure nothing from anyone except Monsieur the Cardinal and the king. It is by his courage, please observe, by his courage alone, that a gentleman can make his way nowadays. Whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him. You are young. You ought to be brave for two reasons: the first is that you are a Gascon, and the second is that you are my son. Never fear quarrels, but seek adventures. I have taught you how to handle a sword; you have thews of iron, a wrist of steel. Fight on all occasions. Fight the more for duels being forbidden, since consequently there is twice as much courage in fighting. I have nothing to give you, my son, but fifteen crowns, my horse, and the counsels you have just heard. Your mother will add to them a recipe for a certain balsam, which she had from a Bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that do not reach the heart. Take advantage of all, and live happily and long. I have but one word to add, and that is to propose an example to you\u2014not mine, for I myself have never appeared at court, and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer; I speak of Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville, who was formerly my neighbor, and who had the honor to be, as a child, the play-fellow of our king, Louis XIII., whom God preserve! Sometimes their play degenerated into battles, and in these battles the king was not always the stronger. The blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville. Afterward, Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville fought with others: in his first journey to Paris, five times; from the death of the late king till the young one came of age, without reckoning wars and sieges, seven times; and from that date up to the present day, a hundred times, perhaps! So that in spite of edicts, ordinances, and decrees, there he is, captain of the Musketeers; that is to say, chief of a legion of C\u00e6sars, whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads\u2014he who dreads nothing, as it is said. Still further, Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville gains ten thousand crowns a year; he is therefore a great noble. He began as you begin. Go to him with this letter, and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done.\u201d\n\nUpon which M. d\u2019Artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son, kissed him tenderly on both cheeks, and gave him his benediction.\n\n\nOn leaving the paternal chamber, the young man found his mother, who was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment. The adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other\u2014not that M. d\u2019Artagnan did not love his son, who was his only offspring, but M. d\u2019Artagnan was a man, and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings; whereas Mme. D\u2019Artagnan was a woman, and still more, a mother. She wept abundantly; and\u2014let us speak it to the praise of M. d\u2019Artagnan the younger\u2014notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm, as a future Musketeer ought, nature prevailed, and he shed many tears, of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half.\n\nThe same day the young man set forward on his journey, furnished with the three paternal gifts, which consisted, as we have said, of fifteen crowns, the horse, and the letter for M. de Tr\u00e9ville\u2014the counsels being thrown into the bargain.\n\nWith such a _vade mecum_ D\u2019Artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes, to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait. Don Quixote took windmills for giants, and sheep for armies; D\u2019Artagnan took every smile for an insult, and every look as a provocation\u2014whence it resulted that from Tarbes to Meung his fist was constantly doubled, or his hand on the hilt of his sword; and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw, nor did the sword issue from its scabbard. It was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers-by; but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length, and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty, these passers-by repressed their hilarity, or if hilarity prevailed over prudence, they endeavored to laugh only on one side, like the masks of the ancients. D\u2019Artagnan, then, remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility, till he came to this unlucky city of Meung.\n\n\nBut there, as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly Miller, without anyone\u2014host, waiter, or hostler\u2014coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse, D\u2019Artagnan spied, though an open window on the ground floor, a gentleman, well-made and of good carriage, although of rather a stern countenance, talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect. D\u2019Artagnan fancied quite naturally, according to his custom, that he must be the object of their conversation, and listened. This time D\u2019Artagnan was only in part mistaken; he himself was not in question, but his horse was. The gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors; and, as I have said, the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator, they every moment burst into fits of laughter. Now, as a half-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man, the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined.",
    "In the meantime, the host, who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry, re-ascended to his wife\u2019s chamber, and found D\u2019Artagnan just recovering his senses. Giving him to understand that the police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord\u2014for in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great lord\u2014he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness D\u2019Artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible. D\u2019Artagnan, half stupefied, without his doublet, and with his head bound up in a linen cloth, arose then, and urged by the host, began to descend the stairs; but on arriving at the kitchen, the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage, drawn by two large Norman horses.\n\nHis interlocutor, whose head appeared through the carriage window, was a woman of from twenty to two-and-twenty years. We have already observed with what rapidity D\u2019Artagnan seized the expression of a countenance. He perceived then, at a glance, that this woman was young and beautiful; and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which D\u2019Artagnan had hitherto resided. She was pale and fair, with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders, had large, blue, languishing eyes, rosy lips, and hands of alabaster. She was talking with great animation with the stranger.\n\n\u201cHis Eminence, then, orders me\u2014\u201d said the lady.\n\n\u201cTo return instantly to England, and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves London.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd as to my other instructions?\u201d asked the fair traveler.\n\n\u201cThey are contained in this box, which you will not open until you are on the other side of the Channel.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well; and you\u2014what will you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014I return to Paris.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, without chastising this insolent boy?\u201d asked the lady.\n\nThe stranger was about to reply; but at the moment he opened his mouth, D\u2019Artagnan, who had heard all, precipitated himself over the threshold of the door.\n\n\u201cThis insolent boy chastises others,\u201d cried he; \u201cand I hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill not escape him?\u201d replied the stranger, knitting his brow.\n\n\u201cNo; before a woman you would dare not fly, I presume?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember,\u201d said Milady, seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword, \u201cthe least delay may ruin everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d cried the gentleman; \u201cbegone then, on your part, and I will depart as quickly on mine.\u201d And bowing to the lady, he sprang into his saddle, while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses. The two interlocutors thus separated, taking opposite directions, at full gallop.\n\n\u201cPay him, booby!\u201d cried the stranger to his servant, without checking the speed of his horse; and the man, after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host, galloped after his master.\n\n\u201cBase coward! false gentleman!\u201d cried D\u2019Artagnan, springing forward, in his turn, after the servant. But his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion. Scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to tingle, a faintness seized him, a cloud of blood passed over his eyes, and he fell in the middle of the street, crying still, \u201cCoward! coward! coward!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a coward, indeed,\u201d grumbled the host, drawing near to D\u2019Artagnan, and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man, as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before.\n\n\u201cYes, a base coward,\u201d murmured D\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut she\u2014she was very beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat _she?_\u201d demanded the host.\n\n\u201cMilady,\u201d faltered D\u2019Artagnan, and fainted a second time.\n\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s all one,\u201d said the host; \u201cI have lost two customers, but this one remains, of whom I am pretty certain for some days to come. There will be eleven crowns gained.\u201d\n\nIt is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s purse.\n\nThe host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day, but he had reckoned without his guest. On the following morning at five o\u2019clock D\u2019Artagnan arose, and descending to the kitchen without help, asked, among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us, for some oil, some wine, and some rosemary, and with his mother\u2019s recipe in his hand composed a balsam, with which he anointed his numerous wounds, replacing his bandages himself, and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor, D\u2019Artagnan walked about that same evening, and was almost cured by the morrow.\n\n\nBut when the time came to pay for his rosemary, this oil, and the wine, the only expense the master had incurred, as he had preserved a strict abstinence\u2014while on the contrary, the yellow horse, by the account of the hostler at least, had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done\u2014D\u2019Artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained; for as to the letter addressed to M. de Tr\u00e9ville, it had disappeared.\n\nThe young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience, turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again, rummaging and rerummaging in his valise, and opening and reopening his purse; but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found, he flew, for the third time, into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine, oil, and rosemary\u2014for upon seeing this hot-headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found, the host seized a spit, his wife a broom handle, and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before.\n\n\u201cMy letter of recommendation!\u201d cried D\u2019Artagnan, \u201cmy letter of recommendation! or, the holy blood, I will spit you all like ortolans!\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat; which was, as we have related, that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two, and which he had entirely forgotten. Hence, it resulted when D\u2019Artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest, he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length, which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard. As to the rest of the blade, the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin.\n\n\nBut this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly just.\n\n\u201cBut, after all,\u201d said he, lowering the point of his spit, \u201cwhere is this letter?\u201d",
    "\u201cThe cardinal\u2019s Guards!\u201d cried Aramis and Porthos at the same time. \u201cSheathe your swords, gentlemen, sheathe your swords!\u201d\n\nBut it was too late. The two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions.\n\n\u201cHalloo!\u201d cried Jussac, advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise, \u201challoo, Musketeers? Fighting here, are you? And the edicts? What is become of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very generous, gentlemen of the Guards,\u201d said Athos, full of rancor, for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day. \u201cIf we were to see you fighting, I can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent you. Leave us alone, then, and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to yourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Jussac, \u201cit is with great regret that I pronounce the thing impossible. Duty before everything. Sheathe, then, if you please, and follow us.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsieur,\u201d said Aramis, parodying Jussac, \u201cit would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves; but unfortunately the thing is impossible\u2014Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville has forbidden it. Pass on your way, then; it is the best thing to do.\u201d\n\nThis raillery exasperated Jussac. \u201cWe will charge upon you, then,\u201d said he, \u201cif you disobey.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are five of them,\u201d said Athos, half aloud, \u201cand we are but three; we shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for, on my part, I declare I will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man.\u201d\n\nAthos, Porthos, and Aramis instantly drew near one another, while Jussac drew up his soldiers.\n\nThis short interval was sufficient to determine D\u2019Artagnan on the part he was to take. It was one of those events which decide the life of a man; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal\u2014the choice made, it must be persisted in. To fight, that was to disobey the law, that was to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself. All this the young man perceived, and yet, to his praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a second. Turning towards Athos and his friends, \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201callow me to correct your words, if you please. You said you were but three, but it appears to me we are four.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you are not one of us,\u201d said Porthos.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d replied D\u2019Artagnan; \u201cI have not the uniform, but I have the spirit. My heart is that of a Musketeer; I feel it, monsieur, and that impels me on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithdraw, young man,\u201d cried Jussac, who doubtless, by his gestures and the expression of his countenance, had guessed D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s design. \u201cYou may retire; we consent to that. Save your skin; begone quickly.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Artagnan did not budge.\n\n\u201cDecidedly, you are a brave fellow,\u201d said Athos, pressing the young man\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cCome, come, choose your part,\u201d replied Jussac.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Porthos to Aramis, \u201cwe must do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsieur is full of generosity,\u201d said Athos.\n\nBut all three reflected upon the youth of D\u2019Artagnan, and dreaded his inexperience.\n\n\u201cWe should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of a boy,\u201d resumed Athos; \u201cand yet it will not be the less said we were four men.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but to yield!\u201d said Porthos.\n\n\u201cThat _is_ difficult,\u201d replied Athos.\n\nD\u2019Artagnan comprehended their irresolution.\n\n\u201cTry me, gentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cand I swear to you by my honor that I will not go hence if we are conquered.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your name, my brave fellow?\u201d said Athos.\n\n\u201cD\u2019Artagnan, monsieur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D\u2019Artagnan, forward!\u201d cried Athos.\n\n\u201cCome, gentlemen, have you decided?\u201d cried Jussac for the third time.\n\n\u201cIt is done, gentlemen,\u201d said Athos.\n\n\u201cAnd what is your choice?\u201d asked Jussac.\n\n\u201cWe are about to have the honor of charging you,\u201d replied Aramis, lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other.\n\n\u201cAh! You resist, do you?\u201d cried Jussac.\n\n\u201cS\u2019blood; does that astonish you?\u201d\n\nAnd the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method.\n\nAthos fixed upon a certain Cahusac, a favorite of the cardinal\u2019s. Porthos had Bicarat, and Aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries. As to D\u2019Artagnan, he sprang toward Jussac himself.\n\nThe heart of the young Gascon beat as if it would burst through his side\u2014not from fear, God be thanked, he had not the shade of it, but with emulation; he fought like a furious tiger, turning ten times round his adversary, and changing his ground and his guard twenty times. Jussac was, as was then said, a fine blade, and had had much practice; nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who, active and energetic, departed every instant from received rules, attacking him on all sides at once, and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis.\n\nThis contest at length exhausted Jussac\u2019s patience. Furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy, he became warm and began to make mistakes. D\u2019Artagnan, who though wanting in practice had a sound theory, redoubled his agility. Jussac, anxious to put an end to this, springing forward, aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary, but the latter parried it; and while Jussac was recovering himself, glided like a serpent beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his body. Jussac fell like a dead mass.\n\nD\u2019Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle.\n\nAramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed him warmly. Nevertheless, Aramis was in a good situation, and able to defend himself.\n\nBicarat and Porthos had just made counterhits. Porthos had received a thrust through his arm, and Bicarat one through his thigh. But neither of these two wounds was serious, and they only fought more earnestly.\n\nAthos, wounded anew by Cahusac, became evidently paler, but did not give way a foot. He only changed his sword hand, and fought with his left hand.\n\nAccording to the laws of dueling at that period, D\u2019Artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased. While he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need, he caught a glance from Athos. The glance was of sublime eloquence. Athos would have died rather than appeal for help; but he could look, and with that look ask assistance. D\u2019Artagnan interpreted it; with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of Cahusac, crying, \u201cTo me, Monsieur Guardsman; I will slay you!\u201d\n\nCahusac turned. It was time; for Athos, whose great courage alone supported him, sank upon his knee.",
    "Meantime, as we have said, despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of Athos, D\u2019Artagnan became hourly more in love with Milady. Thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her; and the self-satisfied Gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond. One day, when he arrived with his head in the air, and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold, he found the _soubrette_ under the gateway of the h\u00f4tel; but this time the pretty Kitty was not contented with touching him as he passed, she took him gently by the hand. \u201cGood!\u201d thought D\u2019Artagnan, \u201cShe is charged with some message for me from her mistress; she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to speak.\u201d And he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air imaginable. \u201cI wish to say three words to you, Monsieur Chevalier,\u201d stammered the _soubrette_. \u201cSpeak, my child, speak,\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan; \u201cI listen.\u201d \u201cHere? Impossible! That which I have to say is too long, and above all, too secret.\u201d \u201cWell, what is to be done?\u201d \u201cIf Monsieur Chevalier would follow me?\u201d said Kitty, timidly. \u201cWhere you please, my dear child.\u201d \u201cCome, then.\u201d And Kitty, who had not let go the hand of D\u2019Artagnan, led him up a little dark, winding staircase, and after ascending about fifteen steps, opened a door. \u201cCome in here, Monsieur Chevalier,\u201d said she; \u201chere we shall be alone, and can talk.\u201d \u201cAnd whose room is this, my dear child?\u201d \u201cIt is mine, Monsieur Chevalier; it communicates with my mistress\u2019s by that door. But you need not fear. She will not hear what we say; she never goes to bed before midnight.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan cast a glance around him. The little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness; but in spite of himself, his eyes were directed to that door which Kitty said led to Milady\u2019s chamber. Kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man, and heaved a deep sigh. \u201cYou love my mistress, then, very dearly, Monsieur Chevalier?\u201d said she. \u201cOh, more than I can say, Kitty! I am mad for her!\u201d Kitty breathed a second sigh. \u201cAlas, monsieur,\u201d said she, \u201cthat is too bad.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil do you see so bad in it?\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan. \u201cBecause, monsieur,\u201d replied Kitty, \u201cmy mistress loves you not at all.\u201d \u201c_Hein!_\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan, \u201ccan she have charged you to tell me so?\u201d \u201cOh, no, monsieur; but out of the regard I have for you, I have taken the resolution to tell you so.\u201d \u201cMuch obliged, my dear Kitty; but for the intention only\u2014for the information, you must agree, is not likely to be at all agreeable.\u201d \u201cThat is to say, you don\u2019t believe what I have told you; is it not so?\u201d \u201cWe have always some difficulty in believing such things, my pretty dear, were it only from self-love.\u201d \u201cThen you don\u2019t believe me?\u201d \u201cI confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d Kitty drew a little note from her bosom. \u201cFor me?\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan, seizing the letter. \u201cNo; for another.\u201d \u201cFor another?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHis name; his name!\u201d cried D\u2019Artagnan. \u201cRead the address.\u201d \u201cMonsieur El Comte de Wardes.\u201d The remembrance of the scene at St. Germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous Gascon. As quick as thought, he tore open the letter, in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do, or rather, what he was doing. \u201cOh, good Lord, Monsieur Chevalier,\u201d said she, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cI?\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan; \u201cnothing,\u201d and he read, \u201cYou have not answered my first note. Are you indisposed, or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of Mme. de Guise? You have an opportunity now, Count; do not allow it to escape.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan became very pale; he was wounded in his _self_-love: he thought that it was in his _love_. \u201cPoor dear Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Kitty, in a voice full of compassion, and pressing anew the young man\u2019s hand. \u201cYou pity me, little one?\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan. \u201cOh, yes, and with all my heart; for I know what it is to be in love.\u201d \u201cYou know what it is to be in love?\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan, looking at her for the first time with much attention. \u201cAlas, yes.\u201d \u201cWell, then, instead of pitying me, you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your mistress.\u201d \u201cAnd what sort of revenge would you take?\u201d \u201cI would triumph over her, and supplant my rival.\u201d \u201cI will never help you in that, Monsieur Chevalier,\u201d said Kitty, warmly. \u201cAnd why not?\u201d demanded D\u2019Artagnan. \u201cFor two reasons.\u201d \u201cWhat ones?\u201d \u201cThe first is that my mistress will never love you.\u201d \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d \u201cYou have cut her to the heart.\u201d \u201cI? In what can I have offended her\u2014I who ever since I have known her have lived at her feet like a slave? Speak, I beg you!\u201d \u201cI will never confess that but to the man\u2014who should read to the bottom of my soul!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan looked at Kitty for the second time. The young girl had freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with their coronets. \u201cKitty,\u201d said he, \u201cI will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like; don\u2019t let that disturb you.\u201d And he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a cherry. \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Kitty, \u201cit is not me you love! It is my mistress you love; you told me so just now.\u201d \u201cAnd does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?\u201d \u201cThe second reason, Monsieur the Chevalier,\u201d replied Kitty, emboldened by the kiss in the first place, and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man, \u201cis that in love, everyone for herself!\u201d Then only D\u2019Artagnan remembered the languishing glances of Kitty, her constantly meeting him in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the stairs, those touches of the hand every time she met him, and her deep sighs; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady, he had disdained the _soubrette_. He whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow. But this time our Gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived from the love which Kitty had just confessed so innocently, or so boldly: the interception of letters addressed to the Comte de Wardes, news on the spot, entrance at all hours into Kitty\u2019s chamber, which was contiguous to her mistress\u2019s. The perfidious deceiver was, as may plainly be perceived, already sacrificing, in intention, the poor girl in order to obtain Milady, willy-nilly. \u201cWell,\u201d said he to the young girl, \u201care you willing, my dear Kitty, that I should give you a proof of that love which you doubt?\u201d \u201cWhat love?\u201d asked the young girl. \u201cOf that which I am ready to feel toward you.\u201d \u201cAnd what is that proof?\u201d \u201cAre you willing that I should this evening pass with you the time I generally spend with your mistress?\u201d \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Kitty, clapping her hands, \u201cvery willing.\u201d \u201cWell, then, come here, my dear,\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan, establishing himself in an easy chair; \u201ccome, and let me tell you that you are the prettiest _soubrette_ I ever saw!\u201d And he did tell her so much, and so well, that the poor girl, who asked nothing better than to believe him, did believe him. Nevertheless, to D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s great astonishment, the pretty Kitty defended herself resolutely. Time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses. Midnight sounded, and almost at the same time the bell was rung in Milady\u2019s chamber. \u201cGood God,\u201d cried Kitty, \u201cthere is my mistress calling me! Go; go directly!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan rose, took his hat, as if it had been his intention to obey, then, opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase, he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of Milady. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d cried Kitty. D\u2019Artagnan, who had secured the key, shut himself up in the closet without reply.",
    "However brilliant had been the part played by Porthos in the duel, it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurator\u2019s wife. On the morrow he received the last touches of Mousqueton\u2019s brush for an hour, and took his way toward the Rue aux Ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with fortune. His heart beat, but not like D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s with a young and impatient love. No; a more material interest stirred his blood. He was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold, to climb those unknown stairs by which, one by one, the old crowns of M. Coquenard had ascended. He was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreams\u2014a coffer long and deep, locked, bolted, fastened in the wall; a coffer of which he had so often heard, and which the hands\u2014a little wrinkled, it is true, but still not without elegance\u2014of the procurator\u2019s wife were about to open to his admiring looks. And then he\u2014a wanderer on the earth, a man without fortune, a man without family, a soldier accustomed to inns, cabarets, taverns, and restaurants, a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats\u2014was about to partake of family meals, to enjoy the pleasures of a comfortable establishment, and to give himself up to those little attentions which \u201cthe harder one is, the more they please,\u201d as old soldiers say. To come in the capacity of a cousin, and seat himself every day at a good table; to smooth the yellow, wrinkled brow of the old procurator; to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them _bassette_, _passe-dix_, and _lansquenet_, in their utmost nicety, and winning from them, by way of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour, their savings of a month\u2014all this was enormously delightful to Porthos. The Musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed, and which indeed have survived them, of the procurators of the period\u2014meanness, stinginess, fasts; but as, after all, excepting some few acts of economy which Porthos had always found very unseasonable, the procurator\u2019s wife had been tolerably liberal\u2014that is, be it understood, for a procurator\u2019s wife\u2014he hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind. And yet, at the very door the Musketeer began to entertain some doubts. The approach was not such as to prepossess people\u2014an ill-smelling, dark passage, a staircase half-lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard; on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails, like the principal gate of the Grand Ch\u00e2telet. Porthos knocked with his hand. A tall, pale clerk, his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair, opened the door, and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature, which indicated strength, the military dress, which indicated rank, and a ruddy countenance, which indicated familiarity with good living. A shorter clerk came behind the first, a taller clerk behind the second, a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third. In all, three clerks and a half, which, for the time, argued a very extensive clientele. Although the Musketeer was not expected before one o\u2019clock, the procurator\u2019s wife had been on the watch ever since midday, reckoning that the heart, or perhaps the stomach, of her lover would bring him before his time. Mme. Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs, and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment. The clerks surveyed him with great curiosity, and he, not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale, remained tongue-tied. \u201cIt is my cousin!\u201d cried the procurator\u2019s wife. \u201cCome in, come in, Monsieur Porthos!\u201d The name of Porthos produced its effect upon the clerks, who began to laugh; but Porthos turned sharply round, and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity. They reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were, and the study in which they ought to have been. This last apartment was a sort of dark room, littered with papers. On quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right, and entered the reception room. All these rooms, which communicated with one another, did not inspire Porthos favorably. Words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors. Then, while passing, he had cast a rapid, investigating glance into the kitchen; and he was obliged to confess to himself, to the shame of the procurator\u2019s wife and his own regret, that he did not see that fire, that animation, that bustle, which when a good repast is on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living. The procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit, as he expressed no surprise at the sight of Porthos, who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air, and saluted him courteously. \u201cWe are cousins, it appears, Monsieur Porthos?\u201d said the procurator, rising, yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair. The old man, wrapped in a large black doublet, in which the whole of his slender body was concealed, was brisk and dry. His little gray eyes shone like carbuncles, and appeared, with his grinning mouth, to be the only part of his face in which life survived. Unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine. During the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt, the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife. The cousin was received with resignation, that was all. M. Coquenard, firm upon his legs, would have declined all relationship with M. Porthos. \u201cYes, monsieur, we are cousins,\u201d said Porthos, without being disconcerted, as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband. \u201cBy the female side, I believe?\u201d said the procurator, maliciously. Porthos did not feel the ridicule of this, and took it for a piece of simplicity, at which he laughed in his large mustache. Mme. Coquenard, who knew that a simple-minded procurator was a very rare variety in the species, smiled a little, and colored a great deal. M. Coquenard had, since the arrival of Porthos, frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk. Porthos comprehended that this chest, although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams, must be the blessed coffer, and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream. M. Coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further; but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon Porthos, he contented himself with saying, \u201cMonsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign, will he not, Madame Coquenard?\u201d This time Porthos received the blow right in his stomach, and felt it. It appeared likewise that Mme. Coquenard was not less affected by it on her part, for she added, \u201cMy cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly; but otherwise he has so little time to pass in Paris, and consequently to spare to us, that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure.\u201d \u201cOh, my legs, my poor legs! where are you?\u201d murmured Coquenard, and he tried to smile. This succor, which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes, inspired much gratitude in the Musketeer toward the procurator\u2019s wife. The hour of dinner soon arrived. They passed into the eating room\u2014a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen. The clerks, who, as it appeared, had smelled unusual perfumes in the house, were of military punctuality, and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down. Their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threatenings. \u201cIndeed!\u201d thought Porthos, casting a glance at the three hungry clerks\u2014for the errand boy, as might be expected, was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table, \u201cin my cousin\u2019s place, I would not keep such gourmands! They look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks.\u201d M. Coquenard entered, pushed along upon his armchair with casters by Mme. Coquenard, whom Porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table. He had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his clerks. \u201cOh, oh!\u201d said he; \u201chere is a soup which is rather inviting.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup?\u201d said Porthos, at the sight of a pale liquid, abundant but entirely free from meat, on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago. Mme. Coquenard smiled, and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat.",
    "Meanwhile the king, who, with more reason than the cardinal, showed his hatred for Buckingham, although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the English from the Isle of R\u00e9, and afterward to press the siege of La Rochelle; but notwithstanding his earnest wish, he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between MM. Bassompierre and Schomberg, against the Duc d\u2019Angoul\u00eame. MM. Bassompierre and Schomberg were marshals of France, and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king; but the cardinal, who feared that Bassompierre, a Huguenot at heart, might press but feebly the English and Rochellais, his brothers in religion, supported the Duc d\u2019Angoul\u00eame, whom the king, at his instigation, had named lieutenant general. The result was that to prevent MM. Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army, a separate command had to be given to each. Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city, between Leu and Dompierre; the Duc d\u2019Angoul\u00eame on the east, from Dompierre to Perigny; and M. de Schomberg on the south, from Perigny to Angoutin. The quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre; the quarters of the king were sometimes at Estr\u00e9e, sometimes at Jarrie; the cardinal\u2019s quarters were upon the downs, at the bridge of La Pierre, in a simple house without any entrenchment. So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre; the king, the Duc d\u2019Angoul\u00eame; and the cardinal, M. de Schomberg. As soon as this organization was established, they set about driving the English from the Isle. The juncture was favorable. The English, who require, above everything, good living in order to be good soldiers, only eating salt meat and bad biscuit, had many invalids in their camp. Still further, the sea, very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast, destroyed every day some little vessel; and the shore, from the point of l\u2019Aiguillon to the trenches, was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles, _roberges_, and feluccas. The result was that even if the king\u2019s troops remained quietly in their camp, it was evident that some day or other, Buckingham, who only continued in the Isle from obstinacy, would be obliged to raise the siege. But as M. de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemy\u2019s camp for a fresh assault, the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair, and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action. As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege, but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating, we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded, to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal. The English, repulsed foot by foot, beaten in all encounters, and defeated in the passage of the Isle of Loie, were obliged to re-embark, leaving on the field of battle two thousand men, among whom were five colonels, three lieutenant colonels, two hundred and fifty captains, twenty gentlemen of rank, four pieces of cannon, and sixty flags, which were taken to Paris by Claude de St. Simon, and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre Dame. Te Deums were chanted in camp, and afterward throughout France. The cardinal was left free to carry on the siege, without having, at least at the present, anything to fear on the part of the English. But it must be acknowledged, this response was but momentary. An envoy of the Duke of Buckingham, named Montague, was taken, and proof was obtained of a league between the German Empire, Spain, England, and Lorraine. This league was directed against France. Still further, in Buckingham\u2019s lodging, which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected, papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which, as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs, strongly compromised Mme. de Chevreuse and consequently the queen. It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell, for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility. All, therefore, of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day, engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of Europe. The cardinal was acquainted with the activity, and more particularly the hatred, of Buckingham. If the league which threatened France triumphed, all his influence would be lost. Spanish policy and Austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre, where they had as yet but partisans; and he, Richelieu\u2014the French minister, the national minister\u2014would be ruined. The king, even while obeying him like a child, hated him as a child hates his master, and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the queen. He would then be lost, and France, perhaps, with him. All this must be prepared against. Courtiers, becoming every instant more numerous, succeeded one another, day and night, in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre, in which the cardinal had established his residence. There were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant; women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms; and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs, savoring of the man of quality a league off. There were also less agreeable visits\u2014for two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated. It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work, in order to have, if wanted, the right of using reprisals; but we must not believe everything ministers say, nor everything their enemies say. These attempts did not prevent the cardinal, to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery, from making nocturnal excursions, sometimes to communicate to the Duc d\u2019Angoul\u00eame important orders, sometimes to confer with the king, and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home. On their part the Musketeers, who had not much to do with the siege, were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life. This was the more easy for our three companions in particular; for being friends of M. de Tr\u00e9ville, they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the camp. Now, one evening when D\u2019Artagnan, who was in the trenches, was not able to accompany them, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, mounted on their battle steeds, enveloped in their war cloaks, with their hands upon their pistol butts, were returning from a drinking place called the Red Dovecot, which Athos had discovered two days before upon the route to Jarrie, following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard, as we have stated, for fear of an ambuscade, when, about a quarter of a league from the village of Boisnau, they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them. They immediately all three halted, closed in, and waited, occupying the middle of the road.",
    "So strange a reception naturally gave Milady ample matter for reflection; so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation, she reclined in her corner of the carriage, and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind.\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, however, surprised at the length of the journey, she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted. Houses were no longer to be seen; trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another. Milady shuddered.\n\n\u201cBut we are no longer in the city, sir,\u201d said she.\n\nThe young officer preserved silence.\n\n\u201cI beg you to understand, sir, I will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me.\u201d\n\nThis threat brought no reply.\n\n\u201cOh, this is too much,\u201d cried Milady. \u201cHelp! help!\u201d\n\nNo voice replied to hers; the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity; the officer seemed a statue.\nMilady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance, and which so rarely failed of their effect; anger made her eyes flash in the darkness.\nThe young man remained immovable.\nMilady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out.\n\n\u201cTake care, madame,\u201d said the young man, coolly, \u201cyou will kill yourself in jumping.\u201d\n\nMilady reseated herself, foaming. The officer leaned forward, looked at her in his turn, and appeared surprised to see that face, just before so beautiful, distorted with passion and almost hideous. The artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul; she collected her features, and in a complaining voice said: \u201cIn the name of heaven, sir, tell me if it is to you, if it is to your government, if it is to an enemy I am to attribute the violence that is done me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo violence will be offered to you, madame, and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in England.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t know me, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd on your honor, you have no cause of hatred against me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone, I swear to you.\u201d\n\nThere was so much serenity, coolness, mildness even, in the voice of the young man, that Milady felt reassured.\nAt length after a journey of nearly an hour, the carriage stopped before an iron gate, which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form, massive, and isolated. Then, as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel, Milady could hear a vast roaring, which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff.\nThe carriage passed under two arched gateways, and at length stopped in a court large, dark, and square. Almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened, the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to Milady, who leaned upon it, and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness.\n\n\u201cStill, then, I am a prisoner,\u201d said Milady, looking around her, and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer; \u201cbut I feel assured it will not be for long,\u201d added she. \u201cMy own conscience and your politeness, sir, are the guarantees of that.\u201d\n\nHowever flattering this compliment, the officer made no reply; but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle, such as boatswains use in ships of war, he whistled three times, with three different modulations. Immediately several men appeared, who unharnessed the smoking horses, and put the carriage into a coach house.\nThen the officer, with the same calm politeness, invited his prisoner to enter the house. She, with a still-smiling countenance, took his arm, and passed with him under a low arched door, which by a vaulted passage, lighted only at the farther end, led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone. They then came to a massive door, which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him, turned heavily upon its hinges, and disclosed the chamber destined for Milady.\nWith a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details. It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man; and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison.\nIn an instant all the strength of mind of this creature, though drawn from the most vigorous sources, abandoned her; she sank into a large easy chair, with her arms crossed, her head lowered, and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her.\nBut no one entered except two or three marines, who brought her trunks and packages, deposited them in a corner, and retired without speaking.\nThe officer superintended all these details with the same calmness Milady had constantly seen in him, never pronouncing a word himself, and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle.\nIt might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist, or had become useless.\nAt length Milady could hold out no longer; she broke the silence. \u201cIn the name of heaven, sir,\u201d cried she, \u201cwhat means all that is passing?\nPut an end to my doubts; I have courage enough for any danger I can foresee, for every misfortune which I understand. Where am I, and why am I here?\nIf I am free, why these bars and these doors?\nIf I am a prisoner, what crime have I committed?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are here in the apartment destined for you, madame. I received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea, and to conduct you to this castle. This order I believe I have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier, but also with the courtesy of a gentleman. There terminates, at least to the present moment, the duty I had to fulfill toward you; the rest concerns another person.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who is that other person?\u201d asked Milady, warmly. \u201cCan you not tell me his name?\u201d\n\nAt the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs. Some voices passed and faded away, and the sound of a single footstep approached the door.\n\n\u201cThat person is here, madame,\u201d said the officer, leaving the entrance open, and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect.\nAt the same time the door opened; a man appeared on the threshold. He was without a hat, carried a sword, and flourished a handkerchief in his hand.\nMilady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom; she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair, and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty.\nThe stranger advanced slowly, and as he advanced, after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp, Milady involuntarily drew back.\nThen when she had no longer any doubt, she cried, in a state of stupor, \u201cWhat, my brother, is it you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, fair lady!\u201d replied Lord de Winter, making a bow, half courteous, half ironical; \u201cit is I, myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this castle, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis chamber?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am, then, your prisoner?\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly so.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is a frightful abuse of power!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo high-sounding words! Let us sit down and chat quietly, as brother and sister ought to do.\u201d\n\nThen, turning toward the door, and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders, he said. \u201cAll is well, I thank you; now leave us alone, Mr. Felton.\u201d",
    "Felton had fallen; but there was still another step to be taken. He must be retained, or rather he must be left quite alone; and Milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result.\nStill more must be done. He must be made to speak, in order that he might be spoken to\u2014for Milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice, which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial.\nYet in spite of all this seduction Milady might fail\u2014for Felton was forewarned, and that against the least chance. From that moment she watched all his actions, all his words, from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures\u2014even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh. In short, she studied everything, as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not accustomed.\nFace to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more easy. She had laid that down the preceding evening. To remain silent and dignified in his presence; from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain, by a contemptuous word; to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignation\u2014such was her plan. Felton would see all; perhaps he would say nothing, but he would see.\nIn the morning, Felton came as usual; but Milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to him. At the moment when he was about to retire, she was cheered with a ray of hope, for she thought he was about to speak; but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth, and making a powerful effort to control himself, he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips, and went out. Toward midday, Lord de Winter entered.\nIt was a tolerably fine winter\u2019s day, and a ray of that pale English sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison.\nMilady was looking out at the window, and pretended not to hear the door as it opened.\n\n\u201cAh, ah!\u201d said Lord de Winter, \u201cafter having played comedy, after having played tragedy, we are now playing melancholy?\u201d\n\nThe prisoner made no reply.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d continued Lord de Winter, \u201cI understand. You would like very well to be at liberty on that beach! You would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald-green sea; you would like very well, either on land or on the ocean, to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning. Patience, patience! In four days\u2019 time the shore will be beneath your feet, the sea will be open to you\u2014more open than will perhaps be agreeable to you, for in four days England will be relieved of you.\u201d\n\nMilady folded her hands, and raising her fine eyes toward heaven, \u201cLord, Lord,\u201d said she, with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone, \u201cpardon this man, as I myself pardon him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, pray, accursed woman!\u201d cried the baron; \u201cyour prayer is so much the more generous from your being, I swear to you, in the power of a man who will never pardon you!\u201d and he went out.\n\nAt the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door, and she perceived Felton, who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her.\nThen she threw herself upon her knees, and began to pray.\n\n\u201cMy God, my God!\u201d said she, \u201cthou knowest in what holy cause I suffer; give me, then, strength to suffer.\u201d\n\nThe door opened gently; the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise, and in a voice broken by tears, she continued:\n\n\u201cGod of vengeance! God of goodness! wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished?\u201d\n\nThen only she pretended to hear the sound of Felton\u2019s steps, and rising quick as thought, she blushed, as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees.\n\n\u201cI do not like to disturb those who pray, madame,\u201d said Felton, seriously; \u201cdo not disturb yourself on my account, I beseech you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know I was praying, sir?\u201d said Milady, in a voice broken by sobs. \u201cYou were deceived, sir; I was not praying.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think, then, madame,\u201d replied Felton, in the same serious voice, but with a milder tone, \u201cdo you think I assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her Creator? God forbid! Besides, repentance becomes the guilty; whatever crimes they may have committed, for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of God!\u201d\n\n\u201cGuilty? I?\u201d said Milady, with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment. \u201cGuilty? Oh, my God, thou knowest whether I am guilty! Say I am condemned, sir, if you please; but you know that God, who loves martyrs, sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you condemned, were you innocent, were you a martyr,\u201d replied Felton, \u201cthe greater would be the necessity for prayer; and I myself would aid you with my prayers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you are a just man!\u201d cried Milady, throwing herself at his feet. \u201cI can hold out no longer, for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at the moment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle, and confess my faith. Listen, then, to the supplication of a despairing woman. You are abused, sir; but that is not the question. I only ask you one favor; and if you grant it me, I will bless you in this world and in the next.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak to the master, madame,\u201d said Felton; \u201chappily I am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing. It is upon one higher placed than I am that God has laid this responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo you\u2014no, to you alone! Listen to me, rather than add to my destruction, rather than add to my ignominy!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have merited this shame, madame, if you have incurred this ignominy, you must submit to it as an offering to God.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say? Oh, you do not understand me! When I speak of ignominy, you think I speak of some chastisement, of imprisonment or death. Would to heaven! Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is I who no longer understand you, madame,\u201d said Felton.\n\n\u201cOr, rather, who pretend not to understand me, sir!\u201d replied the prisoner, with a smile of incredulity.\n\n\u201cNo, madame, on the honor of a soldier, on the faith of a Christian.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, you are ignorant of Lord de Winter\u2019s designs upon me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible; you are his confidant!\u201d\n\n\u201cI never lie, madame.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he conceals them too little for you not to divine them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI seek to divine nothing, madame; I wait till I am confided in, and apart from that which Lord de Winter has said to me before you, he has confided nothing to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, then,\u201d cried Milady, with an incredible tone of truthfulness, \u201cyou are not his accomplice; you do not know that he destines me to a disgrace which all the punishments of the world cannot equal in horror?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are deceived, madame,\u201d said Felton, blushing; \u201cLord de Winter is not capable of such a crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Milady to herself; \u201cwithout thinking what it is, he calls it a crime!\u201d Then aloud, \u201cThe friend of that wretch is capable of everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhom do you call _that wretch?_\u201d asked Felton.\n\n\u201cAre there, then, in England two men to whom such an epithet can be applied?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean George Villiers?\u201d asked Felton, whose looks became excited.\n\n\u201cWhom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles call Duke of Buckingham,\u201d replied Milady. \u201cI could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all England who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom I was speaking.\u201d",
    "It was a stormy and dark night; vast clouds covered the heavens, concealing the stars; the moon would not rise till midnight.\nOccasionally, by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon, the road stretched itself before them, white and solitary; the flash extinct, all remained in darkness.\nEvery minute Athos was forced to restrain D\u2019Artagnan, constantly in advance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which in an instant he again departed from. He had but one thought\u2014to go forward; and he went.\nThey passed in silence through the little village of Festubert, where the wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of Richebourg. At Herlier, Planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.\nSeveral times Lord de Winter, Porthos, or Aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak; but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed, without response. The travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence, and ceased to address themselves to him.\nThe storm increased, the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly, the thunder began to growl, and the wind, the precursor of a hurricane, whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen.\nThe cavalcade trotted on more sharply.\nA little before they came to Fromelles the storm burst. They spread their cloaks. There remained three leagues to travel, and they did it amid torrents of rain.\nD\u2019Artagnan took off his hat, and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak. He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body, agitated by feverish shudders.\nThe moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the Post, a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness, and advanced into the middle of the road, putting his finger on his lips.\nAthos recognized Grimaud.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the manner?\u201d cried Athos. \u201cHas she left Armenti\u00e8res?\u201d\n\nGrimaud made a sign in the affirmative. D\u2019Artagnan ground his teeth.\n\n\u201cSilence, D\u2019Artagnan!\u201d said Athos. \u201cI have charged myself with this affair. It is for me, then, to interrogate Grimaud.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d asked Athos.\n\nGrimaud extended his hands in the direction of the Lys.\n\n\u201cFar from here?\u201d asked Athos.\n\nGrimaud showed his master his forefinger bent.\n\n\u201cAlone?\u201d asked Athos.\n\nGrimaud made the sign yes.\n\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Athos, \u201cshe is alone within half a league of us, in the direction of the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said D\u2019Artagnan. \u201cLead us, Grimaud.\u201d\n\nGrimaud took his course across the country, and acted as guide to the cavalcade.\nAt the end of five hundred paces, more or less, they came to a rivulet, which they forded.\nBy the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim.\n\n\u201cIs she there, Grimaud?\u201d asked Athos.\n\nGrimaud shook his head negatively.\n\n\u201cSilence, then!\u201d cried Athos.\n\nAnd the troop continued their route.\nAnother flash illuminated all around them. Grimaud extended his arm, and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river, within a hundred paces of a ferry.\nOne window was lighted.\n\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d said Athos.\n\nAt this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them. It was Mousqueton. He pointed his finger to the lighted window.\n\n\u201cShe is there,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cAnd Bazin?\u201d asked Athos.\n\n\u201cWhile I watched the window, he guarded the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d said Athos. \u201cYou are good and faithful servants.\u201d\n\nAthos sprang from his horse, gave the bridle to Grimaud, and advanced toward the window, after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door.\nThe little house was surrounded by a low, quickset hedge, two or three feet high. Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window, which was without shutters, but had the half-curtains closely drawn.\nHe mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain.\nBy the light of a lamp he saw a woman, wrapped in a dark mantle, seated upon a stool near a dying fire. Her elbows were placed upon a mean table, and she leaned her head upon her two hands, which were white as ivory.\nHe could not distinguish her countenance, but a sinister smile passed over the lips of Athos. He was not deceived; it was she whom he sought.\nAt this moment a horse neighed. Milady raised her head, saw close to the panes the pale face of Athos, and screamed.\nAthos, perceiving that she knew him, pushed the window with his knee and hand. The window yielded. The squares were broken to shivers; and Athos, like the spectre of vengeance, leaped into the room.\nMilady rushed to the door and opened it. More pale and menacing than Athos, D\u2019Artagnan stood on the threshold.\nMilady recoiled, uttering a cry. D\u2019Artagnan, believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his belt; but Athos raised his hand.\n\n\u201cPut back that weapon, D\u2019Artagnan!\u201d said he; \u201cthis woman must be tried, not assassinated. Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be satisfied. Come in, gentlemen.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself. Behind D\u2019Artagnan entered Porthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak.\nThe four lackeys guarded the door and the window.\nMilady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure this terrible apparition. Perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a terrible cry.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d screamed Milady.\n\n\u201cWe want,\u201d said Athos, \u201cCharlotte Backson, who first was called Comtesse de la F\u00e8re, and afterwards Milady de Winter, Baroness of Sheffield.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is I! that is I!\u201d murmured Milady, in extreme terror; \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wish to judge you according to your crime,\u201d said Athos; \u201cyou shall be free to defend yourself. Justify yourself if you can. M. d\u2019Artagnan, it is for you to accuse her first.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Artagnan advanced.\n\n\u201cBefore God and before men,\u201d said he, \u201cI accuse this woman of having poisoned Constance Bonacieux, who died yesterday evening.\u201d\n\nHe turned towards Porthos and Aramis.\n\n\u201cWe bear witness to this,\u201d said the two Musketeers, with one voice.\n\nD\u2019Artagnan continued: \u201cBefore God and before men, I accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me, in wine which she sent me from Villeroy, with a forged letter, as if that wine came from my friends. God preserved me, but a man named Brisemont died in my place.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe bear witness to this,\u201d said Porthos and Aramis, in the same manner as before.\n\n\u201cBefore God and before men, I accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the Baron de Wardes; but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation, I attest it myself. I have done.\u201d And D\u2019Artagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and Aramis.\n\n\u201cYour turn, my Lord,\u201d said Athos.\n\nThe baron came forward.\n\n\u201cBefore God and before men,\u201d said he, \u201cI accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Duke of Buckingham assassinated!\u201d cried all present, with one voice.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the baron, \u201cassassinated. On receiving the warning letter you wrote to me, I had this woman arrested, and gave her in charge to a loyal servant. She corrupted this man; she placed the poniard in his hand; she made him kill the duke. And at this moment, perhaps, Felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury!\u201d"

  "John Buchan -- Prester John": [
    "When we got home I found Japp with a face like grey paper. 'Did you hear the drums?' he asked.\n\n'Yes,' I said shortly. 'What about them?'\n\n'God forgive you for an ignorant Britisher,' he almost shouted. 'You may hear drums any night, but a drumming like that I only once heard before. It was in '79 in the 'Zeti valley. Do you know what happened next day? Cetewayo's impis came over the hills, and in an hour there wasn't a living white soul in the glen. Two men escaped, and one of them was called Peter Japp.'\n\n'We are in God's hands then, and must wait on His will,' I said solemnly.\n\nThere was no more sleep for Wardlaw and myself that night. We made the best barricade we could of the windows, loaded all our weapons, and trusted to Colin to give us early news. Before supper I went over to get Japp to join us, but found that that worthy had sought help from his old protector, the bottle, and was already sound asleep with both door and window open.\n\nI had made up my mind that death was certain, and yet my heart belied my conviction, and I could not feel the appropriate mood. If anything I was more cheerful since I had heard the drums. It was clearly now beyond the power of me or any man to stop the march of events. My thoughts ran on a native rising, and I kept telling myself how little that was probable. Where were the arms, the leader, the discipline? At any rate such arguments put me to sleep before dawn, and I wakened at eight to find that nothing had happened. The clear morning sunlight, as of old, made Blaauwildebeestefontein the place of a dream. Zeeta brought in my cup of coffee as if this day were just like all others, my pipe tasted as sweet, the fresh air from the Berg blew as fragrantly on my brow. I went over to the store in reasonably good spirits, leaving Wardlaw busy on the penitential Psalms.\n\nThe post-runner had brought the mail as usual, and there was one private letter for me. I opened it with great excitement, for the envelope bore the stamp of the firm. At last Colles had deigned to answer.\n\nInside was a sheet of the firm's notepaper, with the signature of Colles across the top. Below some one had pencilled these five words:\n\n'_The Blesbok are changing ground._'\n\nI looked to see that Japp had not suffocated himself, then shut up the store, and went back to my room to think out this new mystification.\n\nThe thing had come from Colles, for it was the private notepaper of the Durban office, and there was Colles' signature. But the pencilling was in a different hand. My deduction from this was that some one wished to send me a message, and that Colles had given that some one a sheet of signed paper to serve as a kind of introduction. I might take it, therefore, that the scribble was Colles' reply to my letter.\n\nNow, my argument continued, if the unknown person saw fit to send me a message, it could not be merely one of warning. Colles must have told him that I was awake to some danger, and as I was in Blaauwildebeestefontein, I must be nearer the heart of things than any one else. The message must therefore be in the nature of some password, which I was to remember when I heard it again.\n\nI reasoned the whole thing out very clearly, and I saw no gap in my logic. I cannot describe how that scribble had heartened me. I felt no more the crushing isolation of yesterday. There were others beside me in the secret. Help must be on the way, and the letter was the first tidings.\n\nBut how near?--that was the question; and it occurred to me for the first time to look at the postmark. I went back to the store and got the envelope out of the waste-paper basket. The postmark was certainly not Durban. The stamp was a Cape Colony one, and of the mark I could only read three letters, T. R. S. This was no sort of clue, and I turned the thing over, completely baffled. Then I noticed that there was no mark of the post town of delivery. Our letters to Blaauwildebeestefontein came through Pietersdorp and bore that mark. I compared the envelope with others. They all had a circle, and 'Pietersdorp' in broad black letters. But this envelope had nothing except the stamp.\n\nI was still slow at detective work, and it was some minutes before the explanation flashed on me. The letter had never been posted at all. The stamp was a fake, and had been borrowed from an old envelope. There was only one way in which it could have come. It must have been put in the letter-bag while the postman was on his way from Pietersdorp. My unknown friend must therefore be somewhere within eighty miles of me. I hurried off to look for the post-runner, but he had started back an hour before. There was nothing for it but to wait on the coming of the unknown.\n\nThat afternoon I again took Mr Wardlaw for a walk. It is an ingrained habit of mine that I never tell anyone more of a business than is practically necessary. For months I had kept all my knowledge to myself, and breathed not a word to a soul. But I thought it my duty to tell Wardlaw about the letter, to let him see that we were not forgotten. I am afraid it did not encourage his mind. Occult messages seemed to him only the last proof of a deadly danger encompassing us, and I could not shake his opinion.\n\nWe took the same road to the crown of the Berg, and I was confirmed in my suspicion that the woods were empty and the watchers gone. The place was as deserted as the bush at Umvelos'. When we reached the summit about sunset we waited anxiously for the sound of drums. It came, as we expected, louder and more menacing than before. Wardlaw stood pinching my arm as the great tattoo swept down the escarpment, and died away in the far mountains beyond the Olifants. Yet it no longer seemed to be a wall of sound, shutting us out from our kindred in the West. A message had pierced the wall. If the blesbok were changing ground, I believed that the hunters were calling out their hounds and getting ready for the chase.\n\n\nIt froze in the night, harder than was common on the Berg even in winter, and as I crossed the road next morning it was covered with rime. All my fears had gone, and my mind was strung high with expectation. Five pencilled words may seem a small thing to build hope on, but it was enough for me, and I went about my work in the store with a reasonably light heart. One of the first things I did was to take stock of our armoury. There were five sporting Mausers of a cheap make, one Mauser pistol, a Lee-Speed carbine, and a little nickel-plated revolver. There was also Japp's shot-gun, an old hammered breech-loader, as well as the gun I had brought out with me. There was a good supply of cartridges, including a stock for a .400 express which could not be found. I pocketed the revolver, and searched till I discovered a good sheath-knife. If fighting was in prospect I might as well look to my arms.\n\nAll the morning I sat among flour and sugar possessing my soul in as much patience as I could command. Nothing came down the white road from the west. The sun melted the rime; the flies came out and buzzed in the window; Japp got himself out of bed, brewed strong coffee, and went back to his slumbers. Presently it was dinner-time, and I went over to a silent meal with Wardlaw. When I returned I must have fallen asleep over a pipe, for the next thing I knew I was blinking drowsily at the patch of sun in the door, and listening for footsteps. In the dead stillness of the afternoon I thought I could discern a shuffling in the dust. I got up and looked out, and there, sure enough, was some one coming down the road.\n\n\nBut it was only a Kaffir, and a miserable-looking object at that. I had never seen such an anatomy. It was a very old man, bent almost double, and clad in a ragged shirt and a pair of foul khaki trousers. He carried an iron pot, and a few belongings were tied up in a dirty handkerchief. He must have been a _dacha_ smoker, for he coughed hideously, twisting his body with the paroxysms. I had seen the type before--the old broken-down native who had no kin to support him, and no tribe to shelter him. They wander about the roads, cooking their wretched meals by their little fires, till one morning they are found stiff under a bush.\n\nThe native gave me a good-day in Kaffir, then begged for tobacco or a handful of mealie-meal.\n\nI asked him where he came from.\n\n'From the west, Inkoos,' he said, 'and before that from the south. It is a sore road for old bones.'\n\nI went into the store to fetch some meal, and when I came out he had shuffled close to the door. He had kept his eyes on the ground, but now he looked up at me, and I thought he had very bright eyes for such an old wreck.\n\n'The nights are cold, Inkoos,' he wailed, 'and my folk are scattered, and I have no kraal. The aasvogels follow me, and I can hear the blesbok.' 'What about the blesbok?' I asked with a start.\n\n'The blesbok are changing ground,' he said, and looked me straight in the face.\n\n'And where are the hunters?' I asked. 'They are here and behind me,' he said in English, holding out his pot for my meal, while he began to edge into the middle of the road.\n\nI followed, and, speaking English, asked him if he knew of a man named Colles.\n\n'I come from him, young Baas. Where is your house? Ah, the school. There will be a way in by the back window? See that it is open, for I'll be there shortly.' Then lifting up his voice he called down in Sesuto all manner of blessings on me for my kindness, and went shuffling down the sunlit road, coughing like a volcano.\n\nIn high excitement I locked up the store and went over to Mr Wardlaw. No children had come to school that day, and he was sitting idle, playing patience. 'Lock the door,' I said, 'and come into my room. We're on the brink of explanations.'\n\nIn about twenty minutes the bush below the back-window parted and the Kaffir slipped out. He grinned at me, and after a glance round, hopped very nimbly over the sill. Then he examined the window and pulled the curtains.\n\n'Is the outer door shut?' he asked in excellent English. 'Well, get me some hot water, and any spare clothes you may possess, Mr Crawfurd. I must get comfortable before we begin our _indaba_. We've the night before us, so there's plenty of time. But get the house clear, and see that nobody disturbs me at my toilet. I am a modest man, and sensitive about my looks.'",
    "I sat down on a chair and laboured to collect my thoughts. Laputa had gone, and would return sooner or later with Henriques. If I was to remain alive till morning, both of them must be convinced that I was harmless. Laputa was probably of that opinion, but Henriques would recognize me, and I had no wish to have that yellow miscreant investigating my character. There was only one way out of it--I must be incapably drunk. There was not a drop of liquor in the store, but I found an old whisky bottle half full of methylated spirits. With this I thought I might raise an atmosphere of bad whisky, and for the rest I must trust to my meagre gifts as an actor.\n\nSupposing I escaped suspicion, Laputa and Henriques would meet in the outhouse, and I must find some means of overhearing them. Here I was fairly baffled. There was no window in the outhouse save in the roof, and they were sure to shut and bolt the door. I might conceal myself among the barrels inside; but apart from the fact that they were likely to search them before beginning their conference, it was quite certain that they would satisfy themselves that I was safe in the other end of the building before going to the outhouse.\n\nSuddenly I thought of the cellar which we had built below the store. There was an entrance by a trap-door behind the counter, and another in the outhouse. I had forgotten the details, but my hope was that the second was among the barrels. I shut the outer door, prised up the trap, and dropped into the vault, which had been floored roughly with green bricks. Lighting match after match, I crawled to the other end and tried to lift the door. It would not stir, so I guessed that the barrels were on the top of it. Back to the outhouse I went, and found that sure enough a heavy packing-case was standing on a corner. I fixed it slightly open, so as to let me hear, and so arranged the odds and ends round about it that no one looking from the floor of the outhouse would guess at its existence. It occurred to me that the conspirators would want seats, so I placed two cases at the edge of the heap, that they might not be tempted to forage in the interior.\n\nThis done, I went back to the store and proceeded to rig myself out for my part. The cellar had made me pretty dirty, and I added some new daubs to my face. My hair had grown longish, and I ran my hands through it till it stood up like a cockatoo's crest. Then I cunningly disposed the methylated spirits in the places most likely to smell. I burned a little on the floor, I spilt some on the counter and on my hands, and I let it dribble over my coat. In five minutes I had made the room stink like a shebeen. I loosened the collar of my shirt, and when I looked at myself in the cover of my watch I saw a specimen of debauchery which would have done credit to a Saturday night's police cell.\n\nBy this time the sun had gone down, but I thought it better to kindle no light. It was the night of the full moon--for which reason, I supposed, Laputa had selected it--and in an hour or two the world would be lit with that ghostly radiance. I sat on the counter while the minutes passed, and I confess I found the time of waiting very trying for my courage. I had got over my worst nervousness by having something to do, but whenever I was idle my fears returned. Laputa had a big night's work before him, and must begin soon. My vigil, I told myself, could not be long.\n\nMy pony was stalled in a rough shed we had built opposite the store. I could hear him shaking his head and stamping the ground above the croaking of the frogs by the Labongo. Presently it seemed to me that another sound came from behind the store--the sound of horses' feet and the rattle of bridles. It was hushed for a moment, and then I heard human voices. The riders had tied up their horses to a tree and were coming nearer.\n\nI sprawled gracefully on the counter, the empty bottle in my hand, and my eyes fixed anxiously on the square of the door, which was filled with the blue glimmer of the late twilight. The square darkened, and two men peered in. Colin growled from below the counter, but with one hand I held the scruff of his neck.\n\n'Hullo,' I said, 'ish that my black friend? Awfly shorry, old man, but I've f'nish'd th' whisky. The bo-o-ottle shempty,' and I waved it upside down with an imbecile giggle.\n\nLaputa said something which I did not catch. Henriques laughed an ugly laugh.\n\n'We had better make certain of him,' he said.\n\nThe two argued for a minute, and then Laputa seemed to prevail. The door was shut and the key, which I had left in the lock, turned on me.\n\nI gave them five minutes to get to the outhouse and settle to business. Then I opened the trap, got into the cellar, and crawled to the other end. A ray of light was coming through the partially raised door. By a blessed chance some old bricks had been left behind, and of these I made a footstool, which enabled me to get my back level with the door and look out. My laager of barrels was intact, but through a gap I had left I could see the two men sitting on the two cases I had provided for them. A lantern was set between them, and Henriques was drinking out of a metal flask.\n\n\nHe took something--I could not see what--out of his pocket, and held it before his companion.\n\n'Spoils of war,' he said. 'I let Sikitola's men draw first blood. They needed it to screw up their courage. Now they are as wild as Umbooni's.'\n\nLaputa asked a question.\n\n'It was the Dutchmen, who were out on the Koodoo Flats with their cattle. Man, it's no good being squeamish. Do you think you can talk over these surly back-veld fools? If we had not done it, the best of their horses would now be over the Berg to give warning. Besides, I tell you, Sikitola's men wanted blooding. I did for the old swine, Coetzee, with my own hands. Once he set his dogs on me, and I don't forget an injury.'\n\nLaputa must have disapproved, for Henriques' voice grew high.\n\n'Run the show the way you please,' he cried; 'but don't blame me if you make a hash of it. God, man, do you think you are going to work a revolution on skim milk? If I had my will, I would go in and stick a knife in the drunken hog next door.'\n\n'He is safe enough,' Laputa replied. 'I gave him the chance of life, and he laughed at me. He won't get far on his road home.'\n\nThis was pleasant hearing for me, but I scarcely thought of myself. I was consumed with a passion of fury against the murdering yellow devil. With Laputa I was not angry; he was an open enemy, playing a fair game. But my fingers itched to get at the Portugoose--that double-dyed traitor to his race. As I thought of my kindly old friends, lying butchered with their kinsfolk out in the bush, hot tears of rage came to my eyes. Perfect love casteth out fear, the Bible says; but, to speak it reverently, so does perfect hate. Not for safety and a king's ransom would I have drawn back from the game. I prayed for one thing only, that God in His mercy would give me the chance of settling with Henriques.",
    "I was roused by a sudden movement. The whole assembly stood up, and each man clapped his right hand to his brow and then raised it high. A low murmur of 'Inkulu' rose above the din of the water. Laputa strode down the hall, with Henriques limping behind him. They certainly did not suspect my presence in the cave, nor did Laputa show any ruffling of his calm. Only Henriques looked weary and cross. I guessed he had had to ride my pony.\n\nThe old man whom I took to be the priest advanced towards Laputa with his hands raised over his head. A pace before they met he halted, and Laputa went on his knees before him. He placed his hands on his head, and spoke some words which I could not understand. It reminded me, so queer are the tricks of memory, of an old Sabbath-school book I used to have which had a picture of Samuel ordaining Saul as king of Israel. I think I had forgotten my own peril and was enthralled by the majesty of the place--the wavering torches, the dropping wall of green water, above all, the figures of Laputa and the Keeper of the Snake, who seemed to have stepped out of an antique world.\n\nLaputa stripped off his leopard skin till he stood stark, a noble form of a man. Then the priest sprinkled some herbs on the fire, and a thin smoke rose to the roof. The smell was that I had smelled on the Kirkcaple shore, sweet, sharp, and strange enough to chill the marrow. And round the fire went the priest in widening and contracting circles, just as on that Sabbath evening in spring.\n\nOnce more we were sitting on the ground, all except Laputa and the Keeper. Henriques was squatting in the front row, a tiny creature among so many burly savages. Laputa stood with bent head in the centre.\n\nThen a song began, a wild incantation in which all joined. The old priest would speak some words, and the reply came in barbaric music. The words meant nothing to me; they must have been in some tongue long since dead. But the music told its own tale. It spoke of old kings and great battles, of splendid palaces and strong battlements, of queens white as ivory, of death and life, love and hate, joy and sorrow. It spoke, too, of desperate things, mysteries of horror long shut to the world. No Kaffir ever forged that ritual. It must have come straight from Prester John or Sheba's queen, or whoever ruled in Africa when time was young.\n\nI was horribly impressed. Devouring curiosity and a lurking nameless fear filled my mind. My old dread had gone. I was not afraid now of Kaffir guns, but of the black magic of which Laputa had the key.\n\nThe incantation died away, but still herbs were flung on the fire, till the smoke rose in a great cloud, through which the priest loomed misty and huge. Out of the smoke-wreaths his voice came high and strange. It was as if some treble stop had been opened in a great organ, as against the bass drone of the cataract.\n\nHe was asking Laputa questions, to which came answers in that rich voice which on board the liner had preached the gospel of Christ. The tongue I did not know, and I doubt if my neighbours were in better case. It must have been some old sacred language--Phoenician, Sabaean, I know not what--which had survived in the rite of the Snake.\n\nThen came silence while the fire died down and the smoke eddied away in wreaths towards the river. The priest's lips moved as if in prayer: of Laputa I saw only the back, and his head was bowed.\n\nSuddenly a rapt cry broke from the Keeper. 'God has spoken,' he cried. 'The path is clear. The Snake returns to the House of its Birth.'\n\nAn attendant led forward a black goat, which bleated feebly. With a huge antique knife the old man slit its throat, catching the blood in a stone ewer. Some was flung on the fire, which had burned small and low.\n\n'Even so,' cried the priest, 'will the king quench in blood the hearth-fires of his foes.'\n\nThen on Laputa's forehead and bare breast he drew a bloody cross. 'I seal thee,' said the voice, 'priest and king of God's people.' The ewer was carried round the assembly, and each dipped his finger in it and marked his forehead. I got a dab to add to the other marks on my face.\n\n'Priest and king of God's people,' said the voice again, 'I call thee to the inheritance of John. Priest and king was he, king of kings, lord of hosts, master of the earth. When he ascended on high he left to his son the sacred Snake, the ark of his valour, to be God's dower and pledge to the people whom He has chosen.'\n\nI could not make out what followed. It seemed to be a long roll of the kings who had borne the Snake. None of them I knew, but at the end I thought I caught the name of Tchaka the Terrible, and I remembered Arcoll's tale.\n\n\nThe Keeper held in his arms a box of curiously wrought ivory, about two feet long and one broad. He was standing beyond the ashes, from which, in spite of the blood, thin streams of smoke still ascended. He opened it, and drew out something which swung from his hand like a cascade of red fire.\n\n'Behold the Snake,' cried the Keeper, and every man in the assembly, excepting Laputa and including me, bowed his head to the ground and cried 'Ow.'\n\n'Ye who have seen the Snake,' came the voice, 'on you is the vow of silence and peace. No blood shall ye shed of man or beast, no flesh shall ye eat till the vow is taken from you. From the hour of midnight till sunrise on the second day ye are bound to God. Whoever shall break the vow, on him shall the curse fall. His blood shall dry in his veins, and his flesh shrink on his bones. He shall be an outlaw and accursed, and there shall follow him through life and death the Avengers of the Snake. Choose ye, my people; upon you is the vow.'\n\nBy this time we were all flat on our faces, and a great cry of assent went up. I lifted my head as much as I dared to see what would happen next.\n\n\nThe priest raised the necklace till it shone above his head like a halo of blood. I have never seen such a jewel, and I think there has never been another such on earth. Later I was to have the handling of it, and could examine it closely, though now I had only a glimpse. There were fifty-five rubies in it, the largest as big as a pigeon's egg, and the least not smaller than my thumbnail. In shape they were oval, cut on both sides en cabochon, and on each certain characters were engraved. No doubt this detracted from their value as gems, yet the characters might have been removed and the stones cut in facets, and these rubies would still have been the noblest in the world. I was no jewel merchant to guess their value, but I knew enough to see that here was wealth beyond human computation. At each end of the string was a great pearl and a golden clasp. The sight absorbed me to the exclusion of all fear. I, David Crawfurd, nineteen years of age, an assistant-storekeeper in a back-veld dorp, was privileged to see a sight to which no Portuguese adventurer had ever attained. There, floating on the smoke-wreaths, was the jewel which may once have burned in Sheba's hair. As the priest held the collar aloft, the assembly rocked with a strange passion. Foreheads were rubbed in the dust, and then adoring eyes would be raised, while a kind of sobbing shook the worshippers. In that moment I learned something of the secret of Africa, of Prester John's empire and Tchaka's victories.\n\n'In the name of God,' came the voice, 'I deliver to the heir of John the Snake of John.'\n\nLaputa took the necklet and twined it in two loops round his neck till the clasp hung down over his breast. The position changed. The priest knelt before him, and received his hands on his head. Then I knew that, to the confusion of all talk about equality, God has ordained some men to be kings and others to serve. Laputa stood naked as when he was born. The rubies were dulled against the background of his skin, but they still shone with a dusky fire. Above the blood-red collar his face had the passive pride of a Roman emperor. Only his great eyes gloomed and burned as he looked on his followers.",
    "'If I am to be your slave,' I managed to say, 'it would be a pity to beat me so hard. You would get no more work out of me.'\n\n'Mwanga grinned wickedly. 'You are my slave for a day and a night. After that we kill you--slowly. You will burn till your legs fall off and your knees are on the ground, and then you will be chopped small with knives.'\n\nThank God, my courage and common sense were coming back to me.\n\n'What happens to me to-morrow,' I said, 'is the Inkulu's business, not yours. I am his prisoner. But if you lift your hand on me to-day so as to draw one drop of blood the Inkulu will make short work of you. The vow is upon you, and if you break it you know what happens.' And I repeated, in a fair imitation of the priest's voice, the terrible curse he had pronounced in the cave.\n\nYou should have seen the change in that cur's face. I had guessed he was a coward, as he was most certainly a bully, and now I knew it. He shivered, and drew his hand over his eyes.\n\n'Nay, Baas,' he pleaded, 'it was but a joke. No harm shall come on you to-day. But tomorrow--' and his ugly face grew more cheerful.\n\n'To-morrow we shall see what we shall see,' I said stoically, and a loud drum-beat sounded through the camp.\n\n\nIt was the signal for moving, for in the east a thin pale line of gold was beginning to show over the trees. The bonds at my knees and ankles were cut, and I was bundled on to the back of a horse. Then my feet were strapped firmly below its belly. The bridle of my beast was tied to 'Mwanga's, so that there was little chance of escape even if I had been unshackled.\n\nMy thoughts were very gloomy. So far all had happened as I planned, but I seemed to have lost my nerve, and I could not believe in my rescue at the Letaba, while I thought of Inanda's Kraal with sheer horror. Last night I had looked into the heart of darkness, and the sight had terrified me. What part should I play in the great purification? Most likely that of the Biblical scapegoat. But the dolour of my mind was surpassed by the discomfort of my body. I was broken with pains and weariness, and I had a desperate headache. Also, before we had gone a mile, I began to think that I should split in two. The paces of my beast were uneven, to say the best of it, and the bump-bump was like being on the rack. I remembered that the saints of the Covenant used to journey to prison this way, especially the great Mr Peden, and I wondered how they liked it. When I hear of a man doing a brave deed, I always want to discover whether at the time he was well and comfortable in body. That, I am certain, is the biggest ingredient in courage, and those who plan and execute great deeds in bodily weakness have my homage as truly heroic. For myself, I had not the spirit of a chicken as I jogged along at 'Mwanga's side. I wished he would begin to insult me, if only to distract my mind, but he kept obstinately silent. He was sulky, and I think rather afraid of me.\n\n\nAs the sun got up I could see something of the host around me. I am no hand at guessing numbers, but I should put the fighting men I saw at not less than twenty thousand. Every man of them was on this side his prime, and all were armed with good rifles and bandoliers. There were none of your old roers and decrepit Enfields, which I had seen signs of in Kaffir kraals. These guns were new, serviceable Mausers, and the men who bore them looked as if they knew how to handle them. There must have been long months of training behind this show, and I marvelled at the man who had organized it. I saw no field-guns, and the little transport they had was evidently for food only. We did not travel in ranks like an orthodox column. About a third of the force was mounted, and this formed the centre. On each wing the infantry straggled far afield, but there was method in their disorder, for in the bush close ranks would have been impossible. At any rate we kept wonderfully well together, and when we mounted a knoll the whole army seemed to move in one piece. I was well in the rear of the centre column, but from the crest of a slope I sometimes got a view in front. I could see nothing of Laputa, who was probably with the van, but in the very heart of the force I saw the old priest of the Snake, with his treasure carried in the kind of litter which the Portuguese call a machila, between rows of guards. A white man rode beside him, whom I judged to be Henriques. Laputa trusted this fellow, and I wondered why. I had not forgotten the look on his face while he had stared at the rubies in the cave. I had a notion that the Portugoose might be an unsuspected ally of mine, though for blackguard reasons.\n\n\nAbout ten o'clock, as far as I could judge by the sun, we passed Umvelos', and took the right bank of the Labongo. There was nothing in the store to loot, but it was overrun by Kaffirs, who carried off the benches for firewood. It gave me an odd feeling to see the remains of the meal at which I had entertained Laputa in the hands of a dozen warriors. I thought of the long sunny days when I had sat by my nachtmaal while the Dutch farmers rode in to trade. Now these men were all dead, and I was on my way to the same bourne.\n\nSoon the blue line of the Berg rose in the west, and through the corner of my eye, as I rode, I could see the gap of the Klein Labongo. I wondered if Arcoll and his men were up there watching us. About this time I began to be so wretched in body that I ceased to think of the future. I had had no food for seventeen hours, and I was dropping from lack of sleep. The ache of my bones was so great that I found myself crying like a baby. What between pain and weakness and nervous exhaustion, I was almost at the end of my tether, and should have fainted dead away if a halt had not been called. But about midday, after we had crossed the track from Blaauwildebeestefontein to the Portuguese frontier, we came to the broad, shallow drift of the Klein Labongo. It is the way of the Kaffirs to rest at noon, and on the other side of the drift we encamped. I remember the smell of hot earth and clean water as my horse scrambled up the bank. Then came the smell of wood-smoke as fires were lit. It seemed an age after we stopped before my feet were loosed and I was allowed to fall over on the ground. I lay like a log where I fell, and was asleep in ten seconds.",
    "The dusk was gathering fast as we neared the stream. From the stagnant reaches above and below a fine white mist was rising, but the long shallows of the ford were clear. My heart was beginning to flutter wildly, but I kept a tight grip on myself and prayed for patience. As I stared into the evening my hopes sank. I had expected, foolishly enough, to see on the far bank some sign of my friends, but the tall bush was dead and silent.\n\nThe drift slants across the river at an acute angle, roughly S.S.W. I did not know this at the time, and was amazed to see the van of the march turn apparently up stream. Laputa's great voice rang out in some order which was repeated down the column, and the wide flanks of the force converged on the narrow cart-track which entered the water. We had come to a standstill while the front ranks began the passage.\n\n\nI sat shaking with excitement, my eyes straining into the gloom. Water holds the evening light for long, and I could make out pretty clearly what was happening. The leading horsemen rode into the stream with Laputa in front. The ford is not the best going, so they had to pick their way, but in five or ten minutes they were over. Then came some of the infantry of the flanks, who crossed with the water to their waists, and their guns held high above their heads. They made a portentous splashing, but not a sound came from their throats. I shall never know how Laputa imposed silence on the most noisy race on earth. Several thousand footmen must have followed the riders, and disappeared into the far bush. But not a shot came from the bluffs in front.\n\n\nI watched with a sinking heart. Arcoll had failed, and there was to be no check at the drift. There remained for me only the horrors at Inanda's Kraal. I resolved to make a dash for freedom, at all costs, and was in the act of telling Arcoll's man to cut my bonds, when a thought occurred to me.\n\nHenriques was after the rubies, and it was his interest to get Laputa across the river before the attack began. It was Arcoll's business to split the force, and above all to hold up the leader. Henriques would tell him, and for that matter he must have assumed himself, that Laputa would ride in the centre of the force. Therefore there would be no check till the time came for the priest's litter to cross.\n\n\nIt was well that I had not had my bonds cut. Henriques came riding towards me, his face sharp and bright as a ferret's. He pulled up and asked if I were safe. My Kaffir showed my strapped elbows and feet, and tugged at the cords to prove their tightness.\n\n'Keep him well,' said Henriques, 'or you will answer to Inkulu. Forward with him now and get him through the water.' Then he turned and rode back.\n\nMy warder, apparently obeying orders, led me out of the column and into the bush on the right hand. Soon we were abreast of the litter and some twenty yards to the west of it. The water gleamed through the trees a few paces in front. I could see the masses of infantry converging on the drift, and the churning like a cascade which they made in the passage.\n\n\nSuddenly from the far bank came an order. It was Laputa's voice, thin and high-pitched, as the Kaffir cries when he wishes his words to carry a great distance. Henriques repeated it, and the infantry halted. The riders of the column in front of the litter began to move into the stream.\n\nWe should have gone with them, but instead we pulled our horses back into the darkness of the bush. It seemed to me that odd things were happening around the priest's litter. Henriques had left it, and dashed past me so close that I could have touched him. From somewhere among the trees a pistol-shot cracked into the air.\n\n\nAs if in answer to a signal the high bluff across the stream burst into a sheet of fire. 'A sheet of fire' sounds odd enough for scientific warfare. I saw that my friends were using shot-guns and firing with black powder into the mob in the water. It was humane and it was good tactics, for the flame in the grey dusk had the appearance of a heavy battery of ordnance. Once again I heard Henriques' voice. He was turning the column to the right. He shouted to them to get into cover, and take the water higher up. I thought, too, that from far away I heard Laputa.\n\n\nThese were maddening seconds. We had left the business of cutting my bonds almost too late. In the darkness of the bush the strips of hide could only be felt for, and my Kaffir had a woefully blunt knife. Reims are always tough to sever, and mine had to be sawn through. Soon my arms were free, and I was plucking at my other bonds. The worst were those on my ankles below the horse's belly. The Kaffir fumbled away in the dark, and pricked my beast so that he reared and struck out. And all the while I was choking with impatience, and gabbling prayers to myself.\n\n\nThe men on the other side had begun to use ball-cartridge. I could see through a gap the centre of the river, and it was filled with a mass of struggling men and horses. I remember that it amazed me that no shot was fired in return. Then I remembered the vow, and was still more amazed at the power of a ritual on that savage horde.\n\n\nThe column was moving past me to the right. It was a disorderly rabble which obeyed Henriques' orders. Bullets began to sing through the trees, and one rider was hit in the shoulder and came down with a crash. This increased the confusion, for most of them dismounted and tried to lead their horses in the cover. The infantry coming in from the wings collided with them, and there was a struggle of excited beasts and men in the thickets of thorn and mopani. And still my Kaffir was trying to get my ankles loose as fast as a plunging horse would let him. At last I was free, and dropped stiffly to the ground. I fell prone on my face with cramp, and when I got up I rolled like a drunk man. Here I made a great blunder. I should have left my horse with my Kaffir, and bidden him follow me. But I was too eager to be cautious, so I let it go, and crying to the Kaffir to await me, I ran towards the litter.",
    "I ran till my breath grew short, for some kind of swift motion I had to have or choke. The events of the last few minutes had inflamed my brain. For the first time in my life I had seen men die by violence--nay, by brutal murder. I had put my soul into the blow which laid out Henriques, and I was still hot with the pride of it. Also I had in my pocket the fetich of the whole black world; I had taken their Ark of the Covenant, and soon Laputa would be on my trail. Fear, pride, and a blind exultation all throbbed in my veins. I must have run three miles before I came to my sober senses.\n\n\nI put my ear to the ground, but heard no sound of pursuit. Laputa, I argued, would have enough to do for a little, shepherding his flock over the water. He might surround and capture the patrol, or he might evade it; the vow prevented him from fighting it. On the whole I was clear that he would ignore it and push on for the rendezvous. All this would take time, and the business of the priest would have to wait. When Henriques came to he would no doubt have a story to tell, and the scouts would be on my trail. I wished I had shot the Portugoose while I was at the business. It would have been no murder, but a righteous execution.\n\n\nMeanwhile I must get off the road. The sand had been disturbed by an army, so there was little fear of my steps being traced. Still it was only wise to leave the track which I would be assumed to have taken, for Laputa would guess I had fled back the way to Blaauwildebeestefontein. I turned into the bush, which here was thin and sparse like whins on a common.\n\n\nThe Berg must be my goal. Once on the plateau I would be inside the white man's lines. Down here in the plains I was in the country of my enemies. Arcoll meant to fight on the uplands when it came to fighting. The black man might rage as he pleased in his own flats, but we stood to defend the gates of the hills. Therefore over the Berg I must be before morning, or there would be a dead man with no tales to tell.\n\n\nI think that even at the start of that night's work I realized the exceeding precariousness of my chances. Some twenty miles of bush and swamp separated me from the foot of the mountains. After that there was the climbing of them, for at the point opposite where I now stood the Berg does not descend sharply on the plain, but is broken into foot-hills around the glens of the Klein Letaba and the Letsitela. From the spot where these rivers emerge on the flats to the crown of the plateau is ten miles at the shortest. I had a start of an hour or so, but before dawn I had to traverse thirty miles of unknown and difficult country. Behind me would follow the best trackers in Africa, who knew every foot of the wilderness. It was a wild hazard, but it was my only hope. At this time I was feeling pretty courageous. For one thing I had Henriques' pistol close to my leg, and for another I still thrilled with the satisfaction of having smitten his face.\n\n\nI took the rubies, and stowed them below my shirt and next my skin. I remember taking stock of my equipment and laughing at the humour of it. One of the heels was almost twisted off my boots, and my shirt and breeches were old at the best and ragged from hard usage. The whole outfit would have been dear at five shillings, or seven-and-six with the belt thrown in. Then there was the Portugoose's pistol, costing, say, a guinea; and last, the Prester's collar, worth several millions.\n\n\nWhat was more important than my clothing was my bodily strength. I was still very sore from the bonds and the jog of that accursed horse, but exercise was rapidly suppling my joints. About five hours ago I had eaten a filling, though not very sustaining, meal, and I thought I could go on very well till morning. But I was still badly in arrears with my sleep, and there was no chance of my snatching a minute till I was over the Berg. It was going to be a race against time, and I swore that I would drive my body to the last ounce of strength.\n\n\nMoonrise was still an hour or two away, and the sky was bright with myriad stars. I knew now what starlight meant, for there was ample light to pick my way by. I steered by the Southern Cross, for I was aware that the Berg ran north and south, and with that constellation on my left hand I was bound to reach it sooner or later. The bush closed around me with its mysterious dull green shades, and trees, which in the daytime were thin scrub, now loomed like tall timber. It was very eerie moving, a tiny fragment of mortality, in that great wide silent wilderness, with the starry vault, like an impassive celestial audience, watching with many eyes. They cheered me, those stars. In my hurry and fear and passion they spoke of the old calm dignities of man. I felt less alone when I turned my face to the lights which were slanting alike on this uncanny bush and on the homely streets of Kirkcaple.",
    "The next thing I knew I was being lifted off the _schimmel_ by what seemed to me a thousand hands. Then came a glow of light, a great moon, in the centre of which I stood blinking. I was forced to sit down on a bed, while I was given a cup of hot tea, far more reviving than any spirits. I became conscious that some one was holding my hands, and speaking very slowly and gently.\n\n'Davie,' the voice said, 'you're back among friends, my lad. Tell me, where have you been?'\n\n'I want Arcoll,' I moaned. 'Where is Ratitswan?' There were tears of weakness running down my cheeks.\n\n'Arcoll is here,' said the voice; 'he is holding your hands, Davie. Quiet, lad, quiet. Your troubles are all over now.'\n\nI made a great effort, found the eyes to which the voice belonged, and spoke to them.\n\n'Listen. I stole the collar of Prester John at Dupree's Drift. I was caught in the Berg and taken to the kraal--I forget its name--but I had hid the rubies.'\n\n'Yes,' the voice said, 'you hid the rubies,--and then?'\n\n'Inkulu wanted them back, so I made a deal with him. I took him to Machudi's and gave him the collar, and then he fired at me and I climbed and climbed ... I climbed on a horse,' I concluded childishly.\n\nI heard the voice say 'Yes?' again inquiringly, but my mind ran off at a tangent.\n\n'Beyers took guns up into the Wolkberg,' I cried shrilly. 'Why the devil don't you do the same? You have the whole Kaffir army in a trap.'\n\nI saw a smiling face before me.\n\n'Good lad. Colles told me you weren't wanting in intelligence. What if we have done that very thing, Davie?'\n\nBut I was not listening. I was trying to remember the thing I most wanted to say, and that was not about Beyers and his guns. Those were nightmare minutes. A speaker who has lost the thread of his discourse, a soldier who with a bayonet at his throat has forgotten the password--I felt like them, and worse. And to crown all I felt my faintness coming back, and my head dropping with heaviness. I was in a torment of impotence.\n\nArcoll, still holding my hands, brought his face close to mine, so that his clear eyes mastered and constrained me.\n\n'Look at me, Davie,' I heard him say. 'You have something to tell me, and it is very important. It is about Laputa, isn't it? Think, man. You took him to Machudi's and gave him the collar. He has gone back with it to Inanda's Kraal. Very well, my guns will hold him there.'\n\nI shook my head. 'You can't. You may split the army, but you can't hold Laputa. He will be over the Olifants before you fire a shot.' 'We will hunt him down before he crosses. And if not, we will catch him at the railway.'\n\n'For God's sake, hurry then,' I cried. 'In an hour he will be over it and back in the kraal.'\n\n'But the river is a long way.'\n\n'River?' I repeated hazily. 'What river? The Letaba is not the place. It is the road I mean.'\n\nArcoll's hands closed firmly on my wrists.\n\n'You left Laputa at Machudi's and rode here without stopping. That would take you an hour. Had Laputa a horse?'\n\n'Yes; but I took it,' I stammered. 'You can see it behind me.' Arcoll dropped my hands and stood up straight.\n\n'By God, we've got him!' he said, and he spoke to his companions. A man turned and ran out of the tent.\n\nThen I remembered what I wanted to say. I struggled from the bed and put my hands on his shoulders.\n\n'Laputa is our side of the highroad. Cut him off from his men, and drive him north--north--away up to the Rooirand. Never mind the Wolkberg and the guns, for they can wait. I tell you Laputa is the Rising, and he has the collar. Without him you can mop up the Kaffirs at your leisure. Line the high-road with every man you have, for he must cross it or perish. Oh, hurry, man, hurry; never mind me. We're saved if we can chivy Laputa till morning. Quick, or I'll have to go myself.'\n\nThe tent emptied, and I lay back on the bed with a dim feeling that my duty was done and I could rest. Henceforth the affair was in stronger hands than mine. I was so weak that I could not lift my legs up to the bed, but sprawled half on and half off.",
    "While I lay in a drugged slumber great things were happening. What I have to tell is no experience of my own, but the story as I pieced it together afterwards from talks with Arcoll and Aitken. The history of the Rising has been compiled. As I write I see before me on the shelves two neat blue volumes in which Mr Alexander Upton, sometime correspondent of the _Times_, has told for the edification of posterity the tale of the war between the Plains and the Plateau. To him the Kaffir hero is Umbooni, a half-witted ruffian, whom we afterwards caught and hanged. He mentions Laputa only in a footnote as a renegade Christian who had something to do with fomenting discontent. He considers that the word 'Inkulu,' which he often heard, was a Zulu name for God. Mr Upton is a picturesque historian, but he knew nothing of the most romantic incident of all. This is the tale of the midnight shepherding of the 'heir of John' by Arcoll and his irregulars.\n\nAt Bruderstroom, where I was lying unconscious, there were two hundred men of the police; sixty-three Basuto scouts under a man called Stephen, who was half native in blood and wholly native in habits; and three commandoes of the farmers, each about forty strong. The commandoes were really companies of the North Transvaal Volunteers, but the old name had been kept and something of the old loose organization. There were also two four-gun batteries of volunteer artillery, but these were out on the western skirts of the Wolkberg following Beyers's historic precedent. Several companies of regulars were on their way from Pietersdorp, but they did not arrive till the next day. When they came they went to the Wolkberg to join the artillery. Along the Berg at strategic points were pickets of police with native trackers, and at Blaauwildebeestefontein there was a strong force with two field guns, for there was some fear of a second Kaffir army marching by that place to Inanda's Kraal. At Wesselsburg out on the plain there was a biggish police patrol, and a system of small patrols along the road, with a fair number of Basuto scouts. But the road was picketed, not held; for Arcoll's patrols were only a branch of his Intelligence Department. It was perfectly easy, as I had found myself, to slip across in a gap of the pickets.\n\nLaputa would be in a hurry, and therefore he would try to cross at the nearest point. Hence it was Arcoll's first business to hold the line between the defile of the Letaba and the camp at Bruderstroom. A detachment of the police who were well mounted galloped at racing speed for the defile, and behind them the rest lined out along the road. The farmers took a line at right angles to the road, so as to prevent an escape on the western flank. The Basutos were sent into the woods as a sort of advanced post to bring tidings of any movement there. Finally a body of police with native runners at their stirrups rode on to the drift where the road crosses the Letaba. The place is called Main Drift, and you will find it on the map. The natives were first of all to locate Laputa, and prevent him getting out on the south side of the triangle of hill and wood between Machudi's, the road, and the Letaba. If he failed there, he must try to ford the Letaba below the drift, and cross the road between the drift and Wesselsburg. Now Arcoll had not men enough to watch the whole line, and therefore if Laputa were once driven below the drift, he must shift his men farther down the road. Consequently it was of the first importance to locate Laputa's whereabouts, and for this purpose the native trackers were sent forward. There was just a chance of capturing him, but Arcoll knew too well his amazing veld-craft and great strength of body to build much hope on that.\n\nWe were none too soon. The advance men of the police rode into one of the Kaffirs from Inanda's Kraal, whom Laputa had sent forward to see if the way was clear. In two minutes more he would have been across and out of our power, for we had no chance of overtaking him in the woody ravines of the Letaba. The Kaffir, when he saw us, dived back into the grass on the north side of the road, which made it clear that Laputa was still there.\n\nAfter that nothing happened for a little. The police reached their drift, and all the road west of that point was strongly held. The flanking commandoes joined hands with one of the police posts farther north, and moved slowly to the scarp of the Berg. They saw nobody; from which Arcoll could deduce that his man had gone down the Berg into the forests.\n\nHad the Basutos been any good at woodcraft we should have had better intelligence. But living in a bare mountain country they are apt to find themselves puzzled in a forest. The best men among the trackers were some renegades of 'Mpefu, who sent back word by a device known only to Arcoll that five Kaffirs were in the woods a mile north of Main Drift. By this time it was after ten o'clock, and the moon was rising. The five men separated soon after, and the reports became confused. Then Laputa, as the biggest of the five, was located on the banks of the Great Letaba about two miles below Main Drift.",
    "I remember that I looked over the brink into the yeasty abyss with a mind hovering between perplexity and tears. I wanted to sit down and cry--why, I did not know, except that some great thing had happened. My brain was quite clear as to my own position. I was shut in this place, with no chance of escape and with no food. In a little I must die of starvation, or go mad and throw myself after Laputa. And yet I did not care a rush. My nerves had been tried too greatly in the past week. Now I was comatose, and beyond hoping or fearing.\n\nI sat for a long time watching the light play on the fretted sheet of water and wondering where Laputa's body had gone. I shivered and wished he had not left me alone, for the darkness would come in time and I had no matches. After a little I got tired of doing nothing, and went groping among the treasure chests. One or two were full of coin--British sovereigns, Kruger sovereigns, Napoleons, Spanish and Portuguese gold pieces, and many older coins ranging back to the Middle Ages and even to the ancients. In one handful there was a splendid gold stater, and in another a piece of Antoninus Pius. The treasure had been collected for many years in many places, contributions of chiefs from ancient hoards as well as the cash received from I.D.B. I untied one or two of the little bags of stones and poured the contents into my hands. Most of the diamonds were small, such as a labourer might secrete on his person. The larger ones--and some were very large--were as a rule discoloured, looking more like big cairngorms. But one or two bags had big stones which even my inexperienced eye told me were of the purest water. There must be some new pipe, I thought, for these could not have been stolen from any known mine.\n\nAfter that I sat on the floor again and looked at the water. It exercised a mesmeric influence on me, soothing all care. I was quite happy to wait for death, for death had no meaning to me. My hate and fury were both lulled into a trance, since the passive is the next stage to the overwrought.\n\nIt must have been full day outside now, for the funnel was bright with sunshine, and even the dim cave caught a reflected radiance. As I watched the river I saw a bird flash downward, skimming the water. It turned into the cave and fluttered among its dark recesses. I heard its wings beating the roof as it sought wildly for an outlet. It dashed into the spray of the cataract and escaped again into the cave. For maybe twenty minutes it fluttered, till at last it found the way it had entered by. With a dart it sped up the funnel of rock into light and freedom.\n\nI had begun to watch the bird in idle lassitude, I ended in keen excitement. The sight of it seemed to take a film from my eyes. I realized the zest of liberty, the passion of life again. I felt that beyond this dim underworld there was the great joyous earth, and I longed for it. I wanted to live now. My memory cleared, and I remembered all that had befallen me during the last few days. I had played the chief part in the whole business, and I had won. Laputa was dead and the treasure was mine, while Arcoll was crushing the Rising at his ease. I had only to be free again to be famous and rich. My hopes had returned, but with them came my fears. What if I could not escape? I must perish miserably by degrees, shut in the heart of a hill, though my friends were out for rescue. In place of my former lethargy I was now in a fever of unrest."

  "Baroness Emmuska Orczy Orczy -- The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel": [
    "It was not, Heaven help us all! a very uncommon occurrence these days: a woman almost unsexed by misery, starvation, and the abnormal excitement engendered by daily spectacles of revenge and of cruelty. They were to be met with every day, round every street corner, these harridans, more terrible far than were the men. This one was still comparatively young, thirty at most; would have been good-looking too, for the features were really delicate, the nose chiselled, the brow straight, the chin round and small. But the mouth! Heavens, what a mouth! Hard and cruel and thin-lipped; and those eyes! sunken and rimmed with purple; eyes that told tales of sorrow and, yes! of degradation. The crowd stood round her, sullen and apathetic; poor, miserable wretches like herself, staring at her antics with lack-lustre eyes and an ever-recurrent contemptuous shrug of the shoulders.\n\nThe woman was dancing, contorting her body in the small circle of light formed by a flickering lanthorn which was hung across the street from house to house, striking the muddy pavement with her shoeless feet, all to the sound of a be-ribboned tambourine which she struck now and again with her small, grimy hand. From time to time she paused, held out the tambourine at arm's length, and went the round of the spectators, asking for alms. But at her approach the crowd at once seemed to disintegrate, to melt into the humid evening air; it was but rarely that a greasy token fell into the outstretched tambourine. Then as the woman started again to dance the crowd gradually reassembled, and stood, hands in pockets, lips still sullen and contemptuous, but eyes watchful of the spectacle. There were such few spectacles these days, other than the monotonous processions of tumbrils with their load of aristocrats for the guillotine!\n\nSo the crowd watched, and the woman danced. The lanthorn overhead threw a weird light on red caps and tricolour cockades, on the sullen faces of the men and the shoulders of the women, on the dancer's weird antics and her flying, tattered skirts. She was obviously tired, as a poor, performing cur might be, or a bear prodded along to uncongenial buffoonery. Every time that she paused and solicited alms with her tambourine the crowd dispersed, and some of them laughed because she insisted.\n\n\"Voyons,\" she said with a weird attempt at gaiety, \"a couple of sous for the entertainment, citizen! You have stood here half an hour. You can't have it all for nothing, what?\"\n\nThe man--young, square-shouldered, thick-lipped, with the look of a bully about his well-clad person--retorted with a coarse insult, which the woman resented. There were high words; the crowd for the most part ranged itself on the side of the bully. The woman backed against the wall nearest to her, held feeble, emaciated hands up to her ears in a vain endeavour to shut out the hideous jeers and ribald jokes which were the natural weapons of this untamed crowd.\n\nSoon blows began to rain; not a few fell upon the unfortunate woman. She screamed, and the more she screamed the louder did the crowd jeer, the uglier became its temper. Then suddenly it was all over. How it happened the woman could not tell. She had closed her eyes, feeling sick and dizzy; but she had heard a loud call, words spoken in English (a language which she understood), a pleasant laugh, and a brief but violent scuffle. After that the hurrying retreat of many feet, the click of sabots on the uneven pavement and patter of shoeless feet, and then silence.\n\nShe had fallen on her knees and was cowering against the wall, had lost consciousness probably for a minute or two. Then she heard that pleasant laugh again and the soft drawl of the English tongue.\n\n\"I love to see those beggars scuttling off, like so many rats to their burrows, don't you, Ffoulkes?\"\n\n\"They didn't put up much fight, the cowards!\" came from another voice, also in English. \"A dozen of them against this wretched woman. What had best be done with her?\"\n\n\"I'll see to her,\" rejoined the first speaker. \"You and Tony had best find the others. Tell them I shall be round directly.\"\n\nIt all seemed like a dream. The woman dared not open her eyes lest reality--hideous and brutal--once more confronted her. Then all at once she felt that her poor, weak body, encircled by strong arms, was lifted off the ground, and that she was being carried down the street, away from the light projected by the lanthorn overhead, into the sheltering darkness of a yawning porte cochere. But she was not then fully conscious.\n\n\nWhen she reopened her eyes she was in what appeared to be the lodge of a concierge. She was lying on a horsehair sofa. There was a sense of warmth and of security around her. No wonder that it still seemed like a dream. Before her stood a man, tall and straight, surely a being from another world--or so he appeared to the poor wretch who, since uncountable time, had set eyes on none but the most miserable dregs of struggling humanity, who had seen little else but rags, and faces either cruel or wretched. This man was clad in a huge caped coat, which made his powerful figure seem preternaturally large. His hair was fair and slightly curly above his low, square brow; the eyes beneath their heavy lids looked down on her with unmistakable kindness.\n\nThe poor woman struggled to her feet. With a quick and pathetically humble gesture she drew her ragged, muddy skirts over her ankles and her tattered kerchief across her breast.\n\n\"I had best go now, Monsieur ... citizen,\" she murmured, while a hot flush rose to the roots of her unkempt hair. \"I must not stop here.... I--\"\n\n\"You are not going, Madame,\" he broke in, speaking now in perfect French and with a great air of authority, as one who is accustomed to being implicitly obeyed, \"until you have told me how, a lady of culture and of refinement, comes to be masquerading as a street-dancer. The game is a dangerous one, as you have experienced to-night.\"\n\n\"It is no game, Monsieur ... citizen,\" she stammered; \"nor yet a masquerade. I have been a street-dancer all my life, and--\"\n\nBy way of an answer he took her hand, always with that air of authority which she never thought to resent.\n\n\"This is not a street-dancer's hand; Madame,\" he said quietly. \"Nor is your speech that of the people.\"\n\nShe drew her hand away quickly, and the flush on her haggard face deepened.\n\n\"If you will honour me with your confidence, Madame,\" he insisted.",
    "Marat, sick, fretful, and worried, had taken an unreasoning dislike to his servant Bas. He was thankful to have a stranger about him, a man who was as miserable as he himself had been a very little while ago; who, like himself, had lived in cellars and in underground burrows, and lived on the scraps of food which even street-curs had disdained.\n\nOn the seventh day following Mole's entry into the household, and while the latter was preparing his employer's bath, Marat said abruptly to him:\n\n\"You'll go as far as the Chemin de Pantin to-day for me, citizen. You know your way?\"\n\n\"I can find it, what?\" muttered Mole, who appeared to be in one of his surly moods.\n\n\"You will have to go very circumspectly,\" Marat went on, in his cracked and feeble voice. \"And see to it that no one spies upon your movements. I have many enemies, citizen ... one especially ... a woman.... She is always prying and spying on me.... So beware of any woman you see lurking about at your heels.\"\n\nMole gave a half-audible grunt in reply.\n\n\"You had best go after dark,\" the other rejoined after awhile. \"Come back to me after nine o'clock. It is not far to the Chemin de Pantin--just where it intersects the Route de Meaux. You can get there and back before midnight. The people will admit you. I will give you a ring--the only thing I possess.... It has little or no value,\" he added with a harsh, grating laugh. \"It will not be worth your while to steal it. You will have to see a brat and report to me on his condition--his appearance, what?... Talk to him a bit.... See what he says and let me know. It is not difficult.\"\n\n\"No, citizen.\"\n\nMole helped the suffering wretch into his bath. Not a movement, not a quiver of the eyelid betrayed one single emotion which he may have felt--neither loathing nor sympathy, only placid indifference. He was just a half-starved menial, thankful to accomplish any task for the sake of satisfying a craving stomach. Marat stretched out his shrunken limbs in the herbal water with a sigh of well-being.\n\n\"And the ring, citizen?\" Mole suggested presently.\n\nThe demagogue held up his left hand--it was emaciated and disfigured by disease. A cheap-looking metal ring, set with a false stone, glistened upon the fourth finger.\n\n\"Take it off,\" he said curtly.\n\nThe ring must have all along been too small for the bony hand of the once famous Court physician. Even now it appeared embedded in the flabby skin and refused to slide over the knuckle.\n\n\"The water will loosen it,\" remarked Mole quietly.\n\nMarat dipped his hand back into the water, and the other stood beside him, silent and stolid, his broad shoulders bent, his face naught but a mask, void and expressionless beneath its coating of grime.\n\nOne or two seconds went by. The air was heavy with steam and a medley of evil-smelling fumes, which hung in the close atmosphere of the narrow room. The sick man appeared to be drowsy, his head rolled over to one side, his eyes closed. He had evidently forgotten all about the ring.\n\nA woman's voice, shrill and peremptory, broke the silence which had become oppressive:\n\n\"Here, citizen Mole, I want you! There's not a bit of wood chopped up for my fire, and how am I to make the coffee without firing, I should like to know?\"\n\n\"The ring, citizen,\" Mole urged gruffly.\n\nMarat had been roused by the woman's sharp voice. He cursed her for a noisy harridan; then he said fretfully:\n\n\"It will do presently--when you are ready to start. I said nine o'clock ... it is only four now. I am tired. Tell citizeness Evrard to bring me some hot coffee in an hour's time.... You can go and fetch me the Moniteur now, and take back these proofs to citizen Dufour. You will find him at the 'Cordeliers,' or else at the printing works.... Come back at nine o'clock.... I am tired now ... too tired to tell you where to find the house which is off the Chemin de Pantin. Presently will do....\"\n\nEven while he spoke he appeared to drop into a fitful sleep. His two hands were hidden under the sheet which covered the bath. Mole watched him in silence for a moment or two, then he turned on his heel and shuffled off through the ante-room into the kitchen beyond, where presently he sat down, squatting in an angle by the stove, and started with his usual stolidness to chop wood for the citizeness' fire.\n\nWhen this task was done, and he had received a chunk of sour bread for his reward from Jeannette Marechal, the cook, he shuffled out of the place and into the street, to do his employer's errands.",
    "From afar, but gradually drawing nearer, came the sound of a ribald song, with chorus accompaniment sung by throats obviously surfeited with liquor.\n\nFor a moment--as the sound approached--Bibot turned back once more to the Friend of the People.\n\n\"Am I to understand, citizen,\" he said, \"that my orders are not to let anyone pass through these gates to-night?\"\n\n\"No, no, citizen,\" replied Marat, \"we dare not do that. There are a number of good patriots in the city still. We cannot interfere with their liberty or--\"\n\nAnd the look of fear of the demagogue--himself afraid of the human whirlpool which he has let loose--stole into Marat's cruel, piercing eyes.\n\n\"No, no,\" he reiterated more emphatically, \"we cannot disregard the passports issued by the Committee of Public Safety. But examine each passport carefully, citizen Bibot! If you have any reasonable ground for suspicion, detain the holder, and if you have not----\"\n\nThe sound of singing was quite near now. With another wink and a final leer, Marat drew back under the shadow of the cabaret, and Bibot swaggered up to the main entrance of the gate.\n\n\"Qui va la?\" he thundered in stentorian tones as a group of some half-dozen people lurched towards him out of the gloom, still shouting hoarsely their ribald drinking song.\n\nThe foremost man in the group paused opposite citizen Bibot, and with arms akimbo, and legs planted well apart tried to assume a rigidity of attitude which apparently was somewhat foreign to him at this moment.\n\n\"Good patriots, citizen,\" he said in a thick voice which he vainly tried to render steady.\n\n\"What do you want?\" queried Bibot.\n\n\"To be allowed to go on our way unmolested.\"\n\n\"What is your way?\"\n\n\"Through the Porte Montmartre to the village of Barency.\"\n\n\"What is your business there?\"\n\nThis query delivered in Bibot's most pompous manner seemed vastly to amuse the rowdy crowd. He who was the spokesman turned to his friends and shouted hilariously:\n\n\"Hark at him, citizens! He asks me what is our business. Oh, citizen Bibot, since when have you become blind? A dolt you've always been, else you had not asked the question.\"\n\nBut Bibot, undeterred by the man's drunken insolence, retorted gruffly:\n\n\"Your business, I want to know.\"\n\n\"Bibot! my little Bibot!\" cooed the bibulous orator now in dulcet tones, \"dost not know us, my good Bibot? Yet we all know thee, citizen--Captain Bibot of the Town Guard, eh, citizens! Three cheers for the citizen captain!\"\n\nWhen the noisy shouts and cheers from half a dozen hoarse throats had died down, Bibot, without more ado, turned to his own men at the gate.\n\n\"Drive these drunken louts away!\" he commanded; \"no one is allowed to loiter here.\"\n\nLoud protest on the part of the hilarious crowd followed, then a slight scuffle with the bayonets of the Town Guard. Finally the spokesman, somewhat sobered, once more appealed to Bibot.\n\n\"Citizen Bibot! you must be blind not to know me and my mates! And let me tell you that you are doing yourself a deal of harm by interfering with the citizens of the Republic in the proper discharge of their duties, and by disregarding their rights of egress through this gate, a right confirmed by passports signed by two members of the Committee of Public Safety.\"\n\nHe had spoken now fairly clearly and very pompously. Bibot, somewhat impressed and remembering Marat's admonitions, said very civilly:\n\n\"Tell me your business then, citizen, and show me your passports. If everything is in order you may go your way.\"\n\n\"But you know me, citizen Bibot?\" queried the other.\n\n\"Yes, I know you--unofficially, citizen Durand.\"\n\n\"You know that I and the citizens here are the carriers for citizen Legrand, the market gardener of Barency?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that,\" said Bibot guardedly, \"unofficially.\"\n\n\"Then, unofficially, let me tell you, citizen, that unless we get to Barency this evening, Paris will have to do without cabbages and potatoes to-morrow. So now you know that you are acting at your own risk and peril, citizen, by detaining us.\"\n\n\"Your passports, all of you,\" commanded Bibot.\n\nHe had just caught sight of Marat still sitting outside the tavern opposite, and was glad enough, in this instance, to shelve his responsibility on the shoulders of the popular \"Friend of the People.\" There was general searching in ragged pockets for grimy papers with official seals thereon, and whilst Bibot ordered one of his men to take the six passports across the road to citizen Marat for his inspection, he himself, by the last rays of the setting winter sun, made close examination of the six men who desired to pass through the Porte Montmartre.\n\nAs the spokesman had averred, he--Bibot--knew every one of these men. They were the carriers to citizen Legrand, the Barency market gardener. Bibot knew every face. They passed with a load of fruit and vegetables in and out of Paris every day. There was really and absolutely no cause for suspicion, and when citizen Marat returned the six passports, pronouncing them to be genuine, and recognising his own signature at the bottom of each, Bibot was at last satisfied, and the six bibulous carriers were allowed to pass through the gate, which they did, arm in arm, singing a wild curmagnole, and vociferously cheering as they emerged out into the open.",
    "Bibot heard his name spoken by a raucous voice. Accompanied by two of his men he crossed the wide gates in order to see what was happening. One of the men held a lanthorn, which he was swinging high above his head. Bibot saw standing there before him, arguing with the guard by the gate, the bibulous spokesman of the band of carriers.\n\nHe was explaining to the sentry that he had a message to deliver to the citizen commanding at the Porte Montmartre.\n\n\"It is a note,\" he said, \"which an officer of the mounted guard gave me. He and twenty troopers were galloping down the great North Road not far from Barency. When they overtook the six of us they drew rein, and the officer gave me this note for citizen Bibot and fifty francs if I would deliver it tonight.\"\n\n\"Give me the note!\" said Bibot calmly.\n\nBut his hand shook as he took the paper; his face was livid with fear and rage.\n\nThe paper had no writing on it, only the outline of a small scarlet flower done in red--the device of the cursed Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\n\"Which way did the officer and the twenty troopers go,\" he stammered, \"after they gave you this note?\"\n\n\"On the way to Calais,\" replied the other, \"but they had magnificent horses, and didn't spare them either. They are a league and more away by now!\"\n\nAll the blood in Bibot's body seemed to rush up to his head, a wild buzzing was in his ears....\n\nAnd that was how the Duc and Duchesse de Montreux, with their servants and family, escaped from Paris on that third day of Nivose in the year I of the Republic.\n\n\nBeing the deposition of citizeness Fanny Roussell, who was brought up, together with her husband, before the Tribunal of the Revolution on a charge of treason--both being subsequently acquitted.\n\nMy name is Fanny Roussell, and I am a respectable married woman, and as good a patriot as any of you sitting there.\n\nAye, and I'll say it with my dying breath, though you may send me to the guillotine ... as you probably will, for you are all thieves and murderers, every one of you, and you have already made up your minds that I and my man are guilty of having sheltered that accursed Englishman whom they call the Scarlet Pimpernel ... and of having helped him to escape.\n\nBut I'll tell you how it all happened, because, though you call me a traitor to the people of France, yet am I a true patriot and will prove it to you by telling you exactly how everything occurred, so that you may be on your guard against the cleverness of that man, who, I do believe, is a friend and confederate of the devil ... else how could he have escaped that time?\n\nWell! it was three days ago, and as bitterly cold as anything that my man and I can remember. We had no travellers staying in the house, for we are a good three leagues out of Calais, and too far for the folk who have business in or about the harbour. Only at midday the coffee-room would get full sometimes with people on their way to or from the port.\n\nBut in the evenings the place was quite deserted, and so lonely that at times we fancied that we could hear the wolves howling in the forest of St. Pierre.\n\nIt was close on eight o'clock, and my man was putting up the shutters, when suddenly we heard the tramp of feet on the road outside, and then the quick word, \"Halt!\"\n\nThe next moment there was a peremptory knock at the door. My man opened it, and there stood four men in the uniform of the 9th Regiment of the Line ... the same that is quartered at Calais. The uniform, of course, I knew well, though I did not know the men by sight.\n\n\"In the name of the People and by the order of the Committee of Public Safety!\" said one of the men, who stood in the forefront, and who, I noticed, had a corporal's stripe on his left sleeve.\n\nHe held out a paper, which was covered with seals and with writing, but as neither my man nor I can read, it was no use our looking at it.\n\nHercule--that is my husband's name, citizens--asked the corporal what the Committee of Public Safety wanted with us poor hoteliers of a wayside inn.\n\n\"Only food and shelter for to-night for me and my men,\" replied the corporal, quite civilly.\n\n\"You can rest here,\" said Hercule, and he pointed to the benches in the coffee-room, \"and if there is any soup left in the stockpot, you are welcome to it.\"\n\nHercule, you see, is a good patriot, and he had been a soldier in his day.... No! no ... do not interrupt me, any of you ... you would only be saying that I ought to have known ... but listen to the end.\n\n\"The soup we'll gladly eat,\" said the corporal very pleasantly. \"As for shelter ... well! I am afraid that this nice warm coffee-room will not exactly serve our purpose. We want a place where we can lie hidden, and at the same time keep a watch on the road. I noticed an outhouse as we came. By your leave we will sleep in there.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" said my man curtly.\n\nHe frowned as he said this, and it suddenly seemed as if some vague suspicion had crept into Hercule's mind.\n\nThe corporal, however, appeared unaware of this, for he went on quite cheerfully:\n\n\"Ah! that is excellent! Entre nous, citizen, my men and I have a desperate customer to deal with. I'll not mention his name, for I see you have guessed it already. A small red flower, what?... Well, we know that he must be making straight for the port of Calais, for he has been traced through St. Omer and Ardres. But he cannot possibly enter Calais city to-night, for we are on the watch for him. He must seek shelter somewhere for himself and any other aristocrat he may have with him, and, bar this house, there is no other place between Ardres and Calais where he can get it. The night is bitterly cold, with a snow blizzard raging round. I and my men have been detailed to watch this road, other patrols are guarding those that lead toward Boulogne and to Gravelines; but I have an idea, citizen, that our fox is making for Calais, and that to me will fall the honour of handing that tiresome scarlet flower to the Public Prosecutor en route for Madame la Guillotine.\"",
    "Nobody in the quartier could quite recollect when it was that the new Public Letter-Writer first set up in business at the angle formed by the Quai des Augustins and the Rue Dauphine, immediately facing the Pont Neuf; but there he certainly was on the 28th day of February, 1793, when Agnes, with eyes swollen with tears, a market basket on her arm, and a look of dreary despair on her young face, turned that selfsame angle on her way to the Pont Neuf, and nearly fell over the rickety construction which sheltered him and his stock-in-trade.\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu! citizen Lepine, I had no idea you were here,\" she exclaimed as soon as she had recovered her balance.\n\n\"Nor I, citizeness, that I should have the pleasure of seeing you this morning,\" he retorted.\n\n\"But you were always at the other corner of the Pont Neuf,\" she argued.\n\n\"So I was,\" he replied, \"so I was. But I thought I would like a change. The Faubourg St. Michel appealed to me; most of my clients came to me from this side of the river--all those on the other side seem to know how to read and write.\"\n\n\"I was just going over to see you,\" she remarked.\n\n\"You, citizeness,\" he exclaimed in unfeigned surprise, \"what should procure a poor public writer the honour of--\"\n\n\"Hush, in God's name!\" broke in the young girl quickly as she cast a rapid, furtive glance up and down the quai and the narrow streets which converged at this angle.\n\nShe was dressed in the humblest and poorest of clothes, her skimpy shawl round her shoulders could scarce protect her against the cold of this cruel winter's morning; her hair was entirely hidden beneath a frilled and starched cap, and her feet were encased in coarse worsted stockings and sabots, but her hands were delicate and fine, and her face had that nobility of feature and look of patient resignation in the midst of overwhelming sorrow which proclaimed a lofty refinement both of soul and of mind.\n\nThe old Letter-Writer was surveying the pathetic young figure before him through his huge horn-rimmed spectacles, and she smiled on him through her fast-gathering tears. He used to have his pitch at the angle of the Pont Neuf, and whenever Agnes had walked past it, she had nodded to him and bidden him \"Good morrow!\" He had at times done little commissions for her and gone on errands when she needed a messenger; to-day, in the midst of her despair, she had suddenly thought of him and that rumour credited him with certain knowledge which she would give her all to possess.\n\nShe had sallied forth this morning with the express purpose of speaking with him; but now suddenly she felt afraid, and stood looking at him for a moment or two, hesitating, wondering if she dared tell him--one never knew these days into what terrible pitfall an ill-considered word might lead one.\n\nA scarecrow he was, that old Public Letter-Writer, more like a great, gaunt bird than a human being, with those spectacles of his, and his long, very sparse and very lanky fringe of a beard which fell from his cheeks and chin and down his chest for all the world like a crumpled grey bib. He was wrapped from head to foot in a caped coat which had once been green in colour, but was now of many hues not usually seen in rainbows. He wore his coat all buttoned down the front, like a dressing-gown, and below the hem there peeped out a pair of very large feet encased in boots which had never been a pair. He sat upon a rickety, straw-bottomed chair under an improvised awning which was made up of four poles and a bit of sacking. He had a table in front of him--a table partially and very insecurely propped up by a bundle of old papers and books, since no two of its four legs were completely whole--and on the table there was a neckless bottle half-filled with ink, a few sheets of paper and a couple of quill pens.\n\nThe young girl's hesitation had indeed not lasted more than a few seconds.\n\nFurtively, like a young creature terrified of lurking enemies, she once more glanced to right and left of her and down the two streets and the river bank, for Paris was full of spies these days--human bloodhounds ready for a few sous to sell their fellow-creatures' lives. It was middle morning now, and a few passers-by were hurrying along wrapped to the nose in mufflers, for the weather was bitterly cold.\n\nAgnes waited until there was no one in sight, then she leaned forward over the table and whispered under her breath:\n\n\"They say, citizen, that you alone in Paris know the whereabouts of the English milor'--of him who is called the Scarlet Pimpernel....\"\n\n\"Hush-sh-sh!\" said the old man quickly, for just at that moment two men had gone by, in ragged coats and torn breeches, who had leered at Agnes and her neat cap and skirt as they passed. Now they had turned the angle of the street and the old man, too, sank his voice to a whisper.\n\n\"I know nothing of any Englishman,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Yes, you do,\" she rejoined insistently. \"When poor Antoine Carre was somewhere in hiding and threatened with arrest, and his mother dared not write to him lest her letter be intercepted, she spoke to you about the English milor', and the English milor' found Antoine Carre and took him and his mother safely out of France. Mme. Carre is my godmother.... I saw her the very night when she went to meet the English milor' at his commands. I know all that happened then.... I know that you were the intermediary.\"\n\n\"And if I was,\" he muttered sullenly as he fiddled with his pen and paper, \"maybe I've had cause to regret it. For a week after that Carre episode I dared not show my face in the streets of Paris; for nigh on a fortnight I dared not ply my trade ... I have only just ventured again to set up in business. I am not going to risk my old neck again in a hurry....\"\n\n\"It is a matter of life and death,\" urged Agnes, as once more the tears rushed to her pleading eyes and the look of misery settled again upon her face.",
    "A quarter of an hour later half dozen men of the Republican Guard, with corporal and sergeant in command, were in the small apartment on the fifth floor of the tenement house in the Rue Jolivet. They had demanded an entry in the name of the Republic, had roughly hustled petite maman and Rosette, questioned them to Lenegre's whereabouts, and not satisfied with the reply which they received, had turned the tidy little home topsy-turvy, ransacked every cupboard, dislocated every bed, table or sofa which might presumably have afforded a hiding place for a man.\n\nSatisfied now that the \"suspect\" whom they were searching for was not on the premises, the sergeant stationed four of his men with the corporal outside the door, and two within, and himself sitting down in the centre of the room ordered the two women to stand before him and to answer his questions clearly on pain of being dragged away forthwith to the St. Lazare house of detention.\n\nPetite maman smoothed out her apron, crossed her arms before her, and looked the sergeant quite straight in the face. Rosette's eyes were full of tears, but she showed no signs of fear either, although her shoulder--where one of the gendarmes had seized it so roughly--was terribly painful.\n\n\"Your husband, citizeness,\" asked the sergeant peremptorily, \"where is he?\"\n\n\"I am not sure, citizen,\" replied petite maman. \"At this hour he is generally at the government works in the Quai des Messageries.\"\n\n\"He is not there now,\" asserted the sergeant. \"We have knowledge that he did not go back to his work since dinner-time.\"\n\nPetite maman was silent.\n\n\"Answer,\" ordered the sergeant.\n\n\"I cannot tell you more, citizen sergeant,\" she said firmly. \"I do not know.\"\n\n\"You do yourself no good, woman, by this obstinacy,\" he continued roughly. \"My belief is that your husband is inside this house, hidden away somewhere. If necessary I can get orders to have every apartment searched until he is found: but in that case it will go much harder with you and with your daughter, and much harder too with your husband than if he gave us no trouble and followed us quietly.\"\n\nBut with sublime confidence in the man who had saved Pierre and who had given her explicit orders as to what she should do, petite maman, backed by Rosette, reiterated quietly:\n\n\"I cannot tell you more, citizen sergeant, I do not know.\"\n\n\"And what about the Englishman?\" queried the sergeant more roughly, \"the man they call the Scarlet Pimpernel, what do you know of him?\"\n\n\"Nothing, citizen,\" replied petite maman, \"what should we poor folk know of an English milor?\"\n\n\"You know at any rate this much, citizeness, that the English milor helped your son Pierre to escape from justice.\"\n\n\"If that is so,\" said petite maman quietly, \"it cannot be wrong for a mother to pray to God to bless her son's preserver.\"\n\n\"It behooves every good citizen,\" retorted the sergeant firmly, \"to denounce all traitors to the Republic.\"\n\n\"But since I know nothing about the Englishman, citizen sergeant--?\"\n\nAnd petite maman shrugged her thin shoulders as if the matter had ceased to interest her.\n\n\"Think again, citizeness,\" admonished the sergeant, \"it is your husband's neck as well as your daughter's and your own that you are risking by so much obstinacy.\"\n\nHe waited a moment or two as if willing to give the old woman time to speak: then, when he saw that she kept her thin, quivering lips resolutely glued together he called his corporal to him.\n\n\"Go to the citizen Commissary of the Section,\" he commanded, \"and ask for a general order to search every apartment in No. 24 Rue Jolivet. Leave two of our men posted on the first and third landings of this house and leave two outside this door. Be as quick as you can. You can be back here with the order in half an hour, or perhaps the committee will send me an extra squad; tell the citizen Commissary that this is a big house, with many corridors. You can go.\"\n\nThe corporal saluted and went.\n\nPetite maman and Rosette the while were still standing quietly in the middle of the room, their arms folded underneath their aprons, their wide-open, anxious eyes fixed into space. Rosette's tears were falling slowly, one by one down her cheeks, but petite maman was dry-eyed. She was thinking, and thinking as she had never had occasion to think before.\n\nShe was thinking of the brave and gallant Englishman who had saved Pierre's life only yesterday. The sergeant, who sat there before her, had asked for orders from the citizen Commissary to search this big house from attic to cellar. That is what made petite maman think and think.  The brave Englishman was in this house at the present moment: the house would be searched from attic to cellar and he would be found, taken, and brought to the guillotine.  The man who yesterday had risked his life to save her boy was in imminent and deadly danger, and she--petite maman--could do nothing to save him.  Every moment now she thought to hear milor's firm tread resounding on stairs or corridor, every moment she thought to hear snatches of an English song, sung by a fresh and powerful voice, never after to-day to be heard in gaiety again.  The old clock upon the shelf ticked away these seconds and minutes while petite maman thought and thought, while men set traps to catch a fellow-being in a deathly snare, and human carnivorous beasts lay lurking for their prey.",
    "Shall I ever forget the day that went by? Mme. la Marquise was well-nigh prostrate with terror, and it was heartrending to watch the noble efforts which she made to amuse M. le Vicomte. The only gleams of sunshine which came to us out of our darkness were the brief appearances of milor. Outside we could hear the measured tramp of the guard that had been set there to keep us close prisoners. They were relieved every six hours, and, in fact, we were as much under arrest as if we were already incarcerated in one of the prisons of Lyons.\n\nAt about four o'clock in the afternoon milor came back to us after a brief absence. He stayed for a little while playing with M. le Vicomte. Just before leaving he took Madame's hand in his and said very earnestly, and sinking his voice to the merest whisper:\n\n\"To-night! Fear nothing! Be ready for anything! Remember that the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel have never failed to succour, and that I hereby pledge you mine honour that you and those you care for will be out of Lyons this night.\"\n\nHe was gone, leaving us to marvel at his strange words. Mme. la Marquise after that was just like a person in a dream. She hardly spoke to me, and the only sound that passed her lips was a quaint little lullaby which she sang to M. le Vicomte ere he dropped off to sleep.\n\nThe hours went by leaden-footed. At every sound on the stairs Madame started like a frightened bird. That infamous Laporte usually paid his visits at about eight o'clock in the evening, and after it became quite dark, Madame sat at the tiny window, and I felt that she was counting the minutes which still lay between her and the dreaded presence of that awful man.\n\nAt a quarter before eight o'clock we heard the usual heavy footfall on the stairs. Madame started up as if she had been struck. She ran to the bed--almost like one demented, and wrapping the one poor blanket round M. le Vicomte, she seized him in her arms. Outside we could hear Laporte's raucous voice speaking to the guard. His usual query: \"Is all well?\" was answered by the brief: \"All well, citizen.\" Then he asked if the English spy were within, and the sentinel replied: \"No, citizen, he went out at about five o'clock and has not come back since.\"\n\n\"Not come back since five o'clock?\" said Laporte with a loud curse. \"Pardi! I trust that that fool Caudy has not allowed him to escape.\"\n\n\"I saw Caudy about an hour ago, citizen,\" said the man.\n\n\"Did he say anything about the Englishman then?\"\n\nIt seemed to us, who were listening to this conversation with bated breath, that the man hesitated a moment ere he replied; then he spoke with obvious nervousness.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, citizen,\" he said, \"Caudy thought then that the Englishman was inside the house, whilst I was equally sure that I had seen him go downstairs an hour before.\"\n\n\"A thousand devils!\" cried Laporte with a savage oath, \"if I find that you, citizen sergeant, or Caudy have blundered there will be trouble for you.\"\n\nTo the accompaniment of a great deal more swearing he suddenly kicked open the door of our attic with his boot, and then came to a standstill on the threshold with his hands in the pockets of his breeches and his legs planted wide apart, face to face with Mme. la Marquise, who confronted him now, herself like a veritable tigress who is defending her young.\n\nHe gave a loud, mocking laugh.\n\n\"Ah, the aristos!\" he cried, \"waiting for that cursed Englishman, what? to drag you and your brat out of the claws of the human tiger.... Not so, my fine ci-devant Marquise. The brat is no longer sick--he is well enough, anyhow, to breathe the air of the prisons of Lyons for a few days pending a final rest in the arms of Mme. la Guillotine. Citizen sergeant,\" he called over his shoulder, \"escort these aristos to my carriage downstairs. When the Englishman returns, tell him he will find his friends under the tender care of Doctor Laporte. En avant, little mother,\" he added, as he gripped Mme. la Marquise tightly by the arm, \"and you, old scarecrow,\" he concluded, speaking to me over his shoulder, \"follow the citizen sergeant, or----\"\n\nMme. la Marquise made no resistance. As I told you, she had been, since dusk, like a person in a dream; so what could I do but follow her noble example? Indeed, I was too dazed to do otherwise.\n\nWe all went stumbling down the dark, rickety staircase, Laporte leading the way with Mme. la Marquise, who had M. le Vicomte tightly clasped in her arms. I followed with the sergeant, whose hand was on my shoulder; I believe that two soldiers walked behind, but of that I cannot be sure.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs through the open door of the house I caught sight of the vague outline of a large barouche, the lanthorns of which threw a feeble light upon the cruppers of two horses and of a couple of men sitting on the box.\n\nMme. la Marquise stepped quietly into the carriage. Laporte followed her, and I was bundled in in his wake by the rough hands of the soldiery. Just before the order was given to start, Laporte put his head out of the window and shouted to the sergeant:\n\n\"When you see Caudy tell him to report himself to me at once. I will be back here in half an hour; keep strict guard as before until then, citizen sergeant.\"\n\nThe next moment the coachman cracked his whip, Laporte called loudly, \"En avant!\" and the heavy barouche went rattling along the ill-paved streets.\n\nInside the carriage all was silence. I could hear Mme. la Marquise softly whispering to M. le Vicomte, and I marvelled how wondrously calm--nay, cheerful, she could be. Then suddenly I heard a sound which of a truth did make my heart stop its beating. It was a quaint and prolonged laugh which I once thought I would never hear again on this earth. It came from the corner of the barouche next to where Mme. la Marquise was so tenderly and gaily crooning to her child. And a kindly voice said merrily:\n\n\"In half an hour we shall be outside Lyons. To-morrow we'll be across the Swiss frontier. We've cheated that old tiger after all. What say you, Mme. la Marquise?\"\n\nIt was milor's voice, and he was as merry as a school-boy.\n\n\"I told you, old Jean-Pierre,\" he added, as he placed that firm hand which I loved so well upon my knee, \"I told you that those confounded murderers would not get me this time.\"\n\nAnd to think that I did not know him, as he stood less than a quarter of an hour ago upon the threshold of our attic in the hideous guise of that abominable Laporte. He had spent two days in collecting old clothes that resembled those of that infamous wretch, and in taking possession of one of the derelict rooms in the house in the Rue des Pipots. Then while we were expecting every moment that Laporte would order our arrest, milor assumed the personality of the monster, hoodwinked the sergeant on the dark staircase, and by that wonderfully audacious coup saved Mme. la Marquise, M. le Vicomte and my humble self from the guillotine.\n\nMoney, of which he had plenty, secured us immunity on the way, and we were in safety over the Swiss frontier, leaving Laporte to eat out his tigerish heart with baffled rage.",
    "At the top of the Rue Berthier the party halted. On ahead--some two hundred metres farther--Yvonne Lebeau's little figure, with her ragged skirt pulled over her head and her bare feet pattering in the mud, was seen crossing one of those intermittent patches of light formed by occasional flickering street lamps, and then was swallowed up once more by the inky blackness beyond.\n\nThe Rue Berthier is a long, narrow, ill-paved and ill-lighted street, composed of low and irregular houses, which abut on the line of fortifications at the back, and are therefore absolutely inaccessible save from the front.\n\nMidway down the street a derelict house rears ghostly debris of roofs and chimney-stacks upward to the sky. A tiny square of yellow light, blinking like a giant eye through a curtainless window, pierced the wall of the house. Roger pointed to that light.\n\n\"That,\" he said, \"is the quarry where our fox has run to earth.\"\n\nNo one said anything; but the dank night air seemed suddenly alive with all the passions of hate let loose by thirty beating hearts.\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel, who had tricked them, mocked them, fooled them so often, was there, not two hundred metres away; and they were thirty to one, and all determined and desperate.\n\nThe darkness was intense.\n\nSilently now the party approached the house, then again they halted, within sixty metres of it.\n\n\"Hist!\"\n\nThe whisper could scarce be heard, so low was it, like the sighing of the wind through a misty veil.\n\n\"Who is it?\" came in quick challenge from Roger.\n\n\"I--Yvonne Lebeau!\"\n\n\"Is he there?\" was the eager whispered query.\n\n\"Not yet. But he may come at any moment. If he saw a crowd round the house, mayhap he would not come.\"\n\n\"He cannot see a crowd. The night is as dark as pitch.\"\n\n\"He can see in the darkest night,\" and the girl's voice sank to an awed whisper, \"and he can hear through a stone wall.\"\n\nInstinctively, Roger shuddered. The superstitious fear which the mysterious personality of the Scarlet Pimpernel evoked in the heart of every Terrorist had suddenly seized this man in its grip.\n\nTry as he would, he did not feel as valiant as he had done when first he emerged at the head of his party from under the portico of the Cordeliers Club, and it was with none too steady a voice that he ordered the girl roughly back to the house. Then he turned once more to his men.\n\nThe plan of action had been decided on in the Club, under the presidency of Robespierre; it only remained to carry the plans through with success.\n\nFrom the side of the fortifications there was, of course, nothing to fear. In accordance with military regulations, the walls of the houses there rose sheer from the ground without doors or windows, whilst the broken-down parapets and dilapidated roofs towered forty feet above the ground.\n\nThe derelict itself was one of a row of houses, some inhabited, others quite abandoned. It was the front of that row of houses, therefore, that had to be kept in view. Marshalled by Roger, the men flattened their meagre bodies against the walls of the houses opposite, and after that there was nothing to do but wait.\n\nTo wait in the darkness of the night, with a thin, icy rain soaking through ragged shirts and tattered breeches, with bare feet frozen by the mud of the road--to wait in silence while turbulent hearts beat well-nigh to bursting--to wait for food whilst hunger gnaws the bowels--to wait for drink whilst the parched tongue cleaves to the roof of the mouth--to wait for revenge whilst the hours roll slowly by and the cries of the darkened city are stilled one by one!\n\nOnce--when a distant bell tolled the hour of ten--a loud prolonged laugh, almost impudent in its suggestion of merry insouciance, echoed through the weird silence of the night.\n\nRoger felt that the man nearest to him shivered at that sound, and he heard a volley or two of muttered oaths.\n\n\"The fox seems somewhere near,\" he whispered. \"Come within. We'll wait for him inside his hole.\"\n\nHe led the way across the street, some of the men following him.\n\nThe door of the derelict house had been left on the latch. Roger pushed it open.\n\nSilence and gloom here reigned supreme; utter darkness, too, save for a narrow streak of light which edged the framework of a door on the right. Not a sound stirred the quietude of this miserable hovel, only the creaking of boards beneath the men's feet as they entered.\n\nRoger crossed the passage and opened the door on the right. His friends pressed closely round to him and peeped over his shoulder into the room beyond.\n\nA guttering piece of tallow candle, fixed to an old tin pot, stood in the middle of the floor, and its feeble, flickering light only served to accentuate the darkness that lay beyond its range. One or two rickety chairs and a rough deal table showed vaguely in the gloom, and in the far corner of the room there lay a bundle of what looked like heaped-up rags, but from which there now emerged the sound of heavy breathing and also a little cry of fear.\n\n\"Yvonne,\" came in feeble, querulous accents from that same bundle of wretchedness, \"are these the English milors come back at last?\"\n\n\"No, no, father,\" was the quick whispered reply.\n\nRoger swore a loud oath, and two puny voices began to whimper piteously.\n\n\"It strikes me the wench has been fooling us,\" muttered one of the men savagely.\n\nThe girl had struggled to her feet. She crouched in the darkness, and two little boys, half-naked and shivering, were clinging to her skirts. The rest of the human bundle seemed to consist of an oldish man, with long, gaunt legs and arms blue with the cold. He turned vague, wide-open eyes in the direction whence had come the harsh voices.\n\n\"Are they friends, Yvonne?\" he asked anxiously.\n\nThe girl did her best to reassure him.\n\n\"Yes, yes, father,\" she whispered close to his ear, her voice scarce above her breath; \"they are good citizens who hoped to find the English milor here. They are disappointed that he has not yet come.\"\n\n\"Ah! but he will come, of a surety,\" said the old man in that querulous voice of his. \"He left his beautiful clothes here this morning, and surely he will come to fetch them.\" And his long, thin hand pointed towards a distant corner of the room.\n\nRoger and his friends, looking to where he was pointing, saw a parcel of clothes, neatly folded, lying on one of the chairs. Like so many wild cats snarling at sight of prey, they threw themselves upon those clothes, tearing them out from one another's hands, turning them over and over as if to force the cloth and satin to yield up the secret that lay within their folds.\n\nIn the skirmish a scrap of paper fluttered to the ground. Roger seized it with avidity, and, crouching on the floor, smoothed the paper out against his knee.\n\nIt contained a few hastily scrawled words, and by the feeble light of the fast-dying candle Roger spelt them out laboriously:\n\n\"If the finder of these clothes will take them to the cross-roads opposite the foot-bridge which leads straight to Courbevoie, and will do so before the clock of Courbevoie Church has struck the hour of midnight, he will be rewarded with the sum of five hundred francs.\"\n\n\"There is something more, citizen Roger,\" said a raucous voice close to his ear. \"Look! Look, citizen--in the bottom corner of the paper!\"\n\n\"The signature.\"\n\n\"A scrawl done in red,\" said Roger, trying to decipher it.\n\n\"It looks like a small flower.\"\n\n\"That accursed Scarlet Pimpernel!\"\n\nAnd even as he spoke the guttering tallow candle, swaying in its socket, suddenly went out with a loud splutter and a sizzle that echoed through the desolate room like the mocking laugh of ghouls.",
    "Esther, up in her little attic, knew nothing of what her English lover was even then suffering for her sake. She herself had passed, during the night, through every stage of horror and of fear. Soon after midnight that execrable brigand Rateau had poked his ugly, cadaverous face in at the door and peremptorily called for Lucienne. The woman, more dead than alive now with terror, had answered with mechanical obedience.\n\n\"I and my friends are thirsty,\" the man had commanded. \"Go and fetch us a litre of eau-de-vie.\"\n\nPoor Lucienne stammered a pitiable: \"Where shall I go?\"\n\n\"To the house at the sign of 'Le fort Samson,' in the Rue de Seine,\" replied Rateau curtly. \"They'll serve you well if you mention my name.\"\n\nOf course Lucienne protested. She was a decent woman, who had never been inside a cabaret in her life.\n\n\"Then it's time you began,\" was Rateau's dry comment, which was greeted with much laughter from his abominable companions.\n\nLucienne was forced to go. It would, of course, have been futile and madness to resist. This had occurred three hours since. The Rue de Seine was not far, but the poor woman had not returned. Esther was left with this additional horror weighing upon her soul. What had happened to her unfortunate servant? Visions of outrage and murder floated before the poor girl's tortured brain. At best, Lucienne was being kept out of the way in order to make her--Esther--feel more lonely and desperate! She remained at the window after that, watching that light in the house opposite and fingering her prayer-book, the only solace which she had. Her attic was so high up and the street so narrow, that she could not see what went on in the street below. At one time she heard a great to-do outside her door. It seemed as if some of the bloodhounds who were set to watch her had gone, or that others came. She really hardly cared which it was. Then she heard a great commotion coming from the street immediately beneath her: men shouting and laughing, and that awful creature's rasping cough.\n\nAt one moment she felt sure that Kennard had called to her by name. She heard his voice distinctly, raised as if in a despairing cry.\n\nAfter that, all was still.\n\nSo still that she could hear her heart beating furiously, and then a tear falling from her eyes upon her open book. So still that the gentle patter of the rain sounded like a soothing lullaby. She was very young, and was very tired. Out, above the line of sloping roofs and chimney pots, the darkness of the sky was yielding to the first touch of dawn. The rain ceased. Everything became deathly still. Esther's head fell, wearied, upon her folded arms.\n\nThen, suddenly, she was wide awake. Something had roused her. A noise. At first she could not tell what it was, but now she knew. It was the opening and shutting of the door behind her, and then a quick, stealthy footstep across the room. The horror of it all was unspeakable. Esther remained as she had been, on her knees, mechanically fingering her prayer-book, unable to move, unable to utter a sound, as if paralysed. She knew that one of those abominable creatures had entered her room, was coming near her even now. She did not know who it was, only guessed it was Rateau, for she heard a raucous, stertorous wheeze. Yet she could not have then turned to look if her life had depended upon her doing so.\n\nThe whole thing had occurred in less than half a dozen heart-beats. The next moment the wretch was close to her. Mercifully she felt that her senses were leaving her. Even so, she felt that a handkerchief was being bound over her mouth to prevent her screaming. Wholly unnecessary this, for she could not have uttered a sound. Then she was lifted off the ground and carried across the room, then over the threshold. A vague, subconscious effort of will helped her to keep her head averted from that wheezing wretch who was carrying her. Thus she could see the landing, and two of those abominable watchdogs who had been set to guard her.\n\nThe ghostly grey light of dawn came peeping in through the narrow dormer window in the sloping roof, and faintly illumined their sprawling forms, stretched out at full length, with their heads buried in their folded arms and their naked legs looking pallid and weird in the dim light. Their stertorous breathing woke the echoes of the bare, stone walls. Esther shuddered and closed her eyes. She was now like an insentient log, without power, or thought, or will--almost without feeling.\n\nThen, all at once, the coolness of the morning air caught her full in the face. She opened her eyes and tried to move, but those powerful arms held her more closely than before. Now she could have shrieked with horror. With returning consciousness the sense of her desperate position came on her with its full and ghastly significance, its awe-inspiring details. The grey dawn, the abandoned wretch who held her, and the stillness of this early morning hour, when not one pitying soul would be astir to lend her a helping hand or give her the solace of mute sympathy. So great, indeed, was this stillness that the click of the man's sabots upon the uneven pavement reverberated, ghoul-like and weird.\n\nAnd it was through that awesome stillness that a sound suddenly struck her ear, which, in the instant, made her feel that she was not really alive, or, if alive, was sleeping and dreaming strange and impossible dreams. It was the sound of a voice, clear and firm, and with a wonderful ring of merriment in its tones, calling out just above a whisper, and in English, if you please:\n\n\"Look out, Ffoulkes! That young cub is as strong as a horse. He will give us all away if you are not careful.\"\n\nA dream? Of course it was a dream, for the voice had sounded very close to her ear; so close, in fact, that ... well! Esther was quite sure that her face still rested against the hideous, tattered, and grimy coat which that repulsive Rateau had been wearing all along. And there was the click of his sabots upon the pavement all the time. So, then, the voice and the merry, suppressed laughter which accompanied it, must all have been a part of her dream. How long this lasted she could not have told you. An hour and more, she thought, while the grey dawn yielded to the roseate hue of morning. Somehow, she no longer suffered either terror or foreboding. A subtle atmosphere of strength and of security seemed to encompass her. At one time she felt as if she were driven along in a car that jolted horribly, and when she moved her face and hands they came in contact with things that were fresh and green and smelt of the country. She was in darkness then, and more than three parts unconscious, but the handkerchief had been removed from her mouth. It seemed to her as if she could hear the voice of her Jack, but far away and indistinct; also the tramp of horses' hoofs and the creaking of cart-wheels, and at times that awful, rasping cough, which reminded her of the presence of a loathsome wretch, who should not have had a part in her soothing dream.\n\nThus many hours must have gone by.\n\nThen, all at once, she was inside a house--a room, and she felt that she was being lowered very gently to the ground. She was on her feet, but she could not see where she was. There was furniture; a carpet; a ceiling; the man Rateau with the sabots and the dirty coat, and the merry English voice, and a pair of deep-set blue eyes, thoughtful and lazy and infinitely kind.\n\nBut before she could properly focus what she saw, everything began to whirl and to spin around her, to dance a wild and idiotic saraband, which caused her to laugh, and to laugh, until her throat felt choked and her eyes hot; after which she remembered nothing more.",
    "As soon as the sound of the children's footsteps had died away down the corridor, Lebel turned with a grunt to his still silent companion. \"And now, citizen Chauvelin,\" he said roughly, \"perhaps you will be good enough to explain what is the meaning of all this tomfoolery.\" \"Tomfoolery, citizen?\" queried the other blandly. \"What tomfoolery, pray?\" \"Why, about those papers!\" growled Lebel savagely. \"Curse you for an interfering busybody! It was I who got information that those pestilential aristos, the Montorgueils, far from having fled the country are in hiding somewhere in my district. I could have made the girl give up their hiding-place pretty soon, without any help from you. What right had you to interfere, I should like to know?\"\n\n\"You know quite well what right I had, citizen Lebel,\" replied Chauvelin with perfect composure. \"The right conferred upon me by the Committee of Public Safety, of whom I am still an unworthy member. They sent me down here to lend you a hand in an investigation which is of grave importance to them.\" \"I know that!\" retorted Lebel sulkily. \"But why have invented the story of the papers?\" \"It is no invention, citizen,\" rejoined Chauvelin with slow emphasis. \"The papers do exist. They are actually in the possession of the Montorgueils, father and son. To capture the two aristos would be not only a blunder, but criminal folly, unless we can lay hands on the papers at the same time.\" \"But what in Satan's name are those papers?\" ejaculated Lebel with a fierce oath.\n\n\"Think, citizen Lebel! Think!\" was Chauvelin's cool rejoinder. \"Methinks you might arrive at a pretty shrewd guess.\" Then, as the other's bluster and bounce suddenly collapsed upon his colleague's calm, accusing gaze, the latter continued with impressive deliberation: \"The papers which the two aristos have in their possession, citizen, are receipts for money, for bribes paid to various members of the Committee of Public Safety by Royalist agents for the overthrow of our glorious Republic. You know all about them, do you not?\"\n\nWhile Chauvelin spoke, a look of furtive terror had crept into Lebel's eyes; his cheeks became the colour of lead. But even so, he tried to keep up an air of incredulity and of amazement. \"I?\" he exclaimed. \"What do you mean, citizen Chauvelin? What should I know about it?\" \"Some of those receipts are signed with your name, citizen Lebel,\" retorted Chauvelin forcefully. \"Bah!\" he added, and a tone of savage contempt crept into his even, calm voice now. \"Heriot, Foucquier, Ducros and the whole gang of you are in it up to the neck: trafficking with our enemies, trading with England, taking bribes from every quarter for working against the safety of the Republic. Ah! if I had my way, I would let the hatred of those aristos take its course. I would let the Montorgueils and the whole pack of Royalist agents publish those infamous proofs of your treachery and of your baseness to the entire world, and send the whole lot of you to the guillotine!\"\n\nHe had spoken with so much concentrated fury, and the hatred and contempt expressed in his pale eyes were so fierce that an involuntary ice-cold shiver ran down the length of Lebel's spine. But, even so, he would not give in; he tried to sneer and to keep up something of his former surly defiance. \"Bah!\" he exclaimed, and with a lowering glance gave hatred for hatred, and contempt for contempt. \"What can you do? An I am not mistaken, there is no more discredited man in France to-day than the unsuccessful tracker of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"\n\nThe taunt went home. It was Chauvelin's turn now to lose countenance, to pale to the lips. The glow of virtuous indignation died out of his eyes, his look became furtive and shamed. \"You are right, citizen Lebel,\" he said calmly after a while. \"Recriminations between us are out of place. I am a discredited man, as you say. Perhaps it would have been better if the Committee had sent me long ago to expiate my failures on the guillotine. I should at least not have suffered, as I am suffering now, daily, hourly humiliation at thought of the triumph of an enemy, whom I hate with a passion which consumes my very soul. But do not let us speak of me,\" he went on quietly. \"There are graver affairs at stake just now than mine own.\"\n\nLebel said nothing more for the moment. Perhaps he was satisfied at the success of his taunt, even though the terror within his craven soul still caused the cold shiver to course up and down his spine. Chauvelin had once more turned to the window; his gaze was fixed upon the distance far away. The window gave on the North. That way, in a straight line, lay Calais, Boulogne, England--where he had been made to suffer such bitter humiliation at the hands of his elusive enemy. And immediately before him was Paris, where the very walls seemed to echo that mocking laugh of the daring Englishman which would haunt him even to his grave.\n\nLebel, unnerved by his colleague's silence, broke in gruffly at last: \"Well then, citizen,\" he said, with a feeble attempt at another sneer, \"if you are not thinking of sending us all to the guillotine just yet, perhaps you will be good enough to explain just how the matter stands?\"",
    "He realised now how tired he was and how hungry. He had not thought to pause in order to consume the small provision of bread and cheese wherewith thoughtful Lucile had provided him. Now he was ready to faint when a loud guffaw, which echoed from one end of the horrible place to the other, greeted his timid request. \"Citizen Rateau!\" the same gruff voice called out hilariously. \"Why, there he is! Here, citizen! there's a blooming aristo to see you.\"\n\nEtienne turned his weary eyes to the corner which was being indicated to him. There he saw a huge creature sprawling across a bench, with long, powerful limbs stretched out before him. Citizen Rateau was clothed, rather than dressed, in a soiled shirt, ragged breeches and tattered stockings, with shoes down at heel and faded crimson cap. His face looked congested and sunken about the eyes; he appeared to be asleep, for stertorous breathing came at intervals from between his parted lips, whilst every now and then a racking cough seemed to tear at his broad chest.\n\nEtienne gave him one look, shuddering with horror, despite himself, at the aspect of this bloated wretch from whom salvation was to come. The whole place seemed to him hideous and loathsome in the extreme. What it all meant he could not understand; all that he knew was that this seemed like another hideous trap into which he and Lucile had fallen, and that he must fly from it--fly at all costs, before he betrayed M. le Marquis still further to these drink-sodden brutes. Another moment, and he feared that he might faint. The din of a bibulous song rang in his ears, the reek of alcohol turned him giddy and sick. He had only just enough strength to turn and totter back into the open. There his senses reeled, the lights in the houses opposite began to dance wildly before his eyes, after which he remembered nothing more.",
    "In all his adventurous career Chauvelin had never felt so calm. His heart beat quite evenly, his senses were undisturbed by the slightest tingling of his nerves. The stealthy sounds in the next room brought the movements of the aristo perfectly clear before his mental vision. The latter was carrying a small dark lanthorn. As soon as he entered he flashed its light about the room. Then he deposited the lanthorn on the floor, close beside the hearth, and started to feel up the chimney for the hidden receptacle.\n\nChauvelin watched him now like a cat watches a mouse, savouring these few moments of anticipated triumph. He pushed open the door noiselessly which gave on the boudoir. By the feeble light of the lanthorn on the ground he could only see the vague outline of the aristo's back, bending forward to his task; but a thrill went through him as he saw a bundle of papers lying on the ground close by.\n\nEverything was ready; the trap was set. Here was a complete victory at last. It was obviously the young Vicomte de Montorgueil who had come to do the deed. His head was up the chimney even now. The old Marquis's back would have looked narrower and more fragile. Chauvelin held his breath; then he gave a sharp little cough, and took the pistol from his belt.\n\nThe sound caused the aristo to turn, and the next moment a loud and merry laugh roused the dormant echoes of the old chateau, whilst a pleasant, drawly voice said in English: \"I am demmed if this is not my dear old friend M. Chambertin! Zounds, sir! who'd have thought of meeting you here?\"\n\nHad a cannon suddenly exploded at Chauvelin's feet he would, I think, have felt less unnerved. For the space of two heart-beats he stood there, rooted to the spot, his eyes glued on his arch-enemy, that execrated Scarlet Pimpernel, whose mocking glance, even through the intervening gloom, seemed to have deprived him of consciousness. But that phase of helplessness only lasted for a moment; the next, all the marvellous possibilities of this encounter flashed through the Terrorist's keen mind.\n\nEverything was ready; the trap was set! The unfortunate Clamettes were still the bait which now would bring a far more noble quarry into the mesh than even he--Chauvelin--had dared to hope.\n\nHe raised his pistol, ready to fire. But already Sir Percy Blakeney was on him, and with a swift movement, which the other was too weak to resist, he wrenched the weapon from his enemy's grasp. \"Why, how hasty you are, my dear M. Chambertin,\" he said lightly. \"Surely you are not in such a hurry to put a demmed bullet into me!\"\n\nThe position now was one which would have made even a braver man than Chauvelin quake. He stood alone and unarmed in face of an enemy from whom he could expect no mercy. But, even so, his first thought was not of escape. He had not only apprised his own danger, but also the immense power which he held whilst the Clamettes remained as hostages in the hands of his colleague Lebel. \"You have me at a disadvantage, Sir Percy,\" he said, speaking every whit as coolly as his foe. \"But only momentarily. You can kill me, of course; but if I do not return from this expedition not only safe and sound, but with a certain packet of papers in my hands, my colleague Lebel has instructions to proceed at once against the girl Clamette and the whole family.\"\n\n\"I know that well enough,\" rejoined Sir Percy with a quaint laugh. \"I know what venomous reptiles you and those of your kidney are. You certainly do owe your life at the present moment to the unfortunate girl whom you are persecuting with such infamous callousness.\"\n\nChauvelin drew a sigh of relief. The situation was shaping itself more to his satisfaction already. Through the gloom he could vaguely discern the Englishman's massive form standing a few paces away, one hand buried in his breeches pockets, the other still holding the pistol. On the ground close by the hearth was the small lanthorn, and in its dim light the packet of papers gleamed white and tempting in the darkness. Chauvelin's keen eyes had fastened on it, saw the form of receipt for money with Heriot's signature, which he recognised, on the top."

  "Arthur Morrison -- The Dorrington Deed-Box": [
    "I shall here set down in language as simple and straightforward as I can command, the events which followed my recent return to England; and I shall leave it to others to judge whether or not my conduct has been characterised by foolish fear and ill-considered credulity. At the same time I have my own opinion as to what would have been the behaviour of any other man of average intelligence and courage in the same circumstances; more especially a man of my exceptional upbringing and retired habits.\n\nI was born in Australia, and I have lived there all my life till quite recently, save for a single trip to Europe as a boy, in company with my father and mother. It was then that I lost my father. I was less than nine years old at the time, but my memory of the events of that European trip is singularly vivid.\n\nMy father had emigrated to Australia at the time of his marriage, and had become a rich man by singularly fortunate speculations in land in and about Sydney. As a family we were most uncommonly self-centred and isolated. From my parents I never heard a word as to their relatives in England; indeed to this day I do not as much as know what was the Christian name of my grandfather. I have often supposed that some serious family quarrel or great misfortune must have preceded or accompanied my father's marriage. Be that as it may, I was never able to learn anything of my relatives, either on my mother's or my father's side. Both parents, however, were educated people, and indeed I fancy that their habit of seclusion must first have arisen from this circumstance, since the colonists about them in the early days, excellent people as they were, were not as a class distinguished for extreme intellectual culture. My father had his library stocked from England, and added to by fresh arrivals from time to time; and among his books he would pass most of his days, taking, however, now and again an excursion with a gun in search of some new specimen to add to his museum of natural history, which occupied three long rooms in our house by the Lane Cove river.\n\nI was, as I have said, eight years of age when I started with my parents on a European tour, and it was in the year 1873. We stayed but a short while in England at first arrival, intending to make a longer stay on our return from the Continent. We made our tour, taking Italy last, and it was here that my father encountered a dangerous adventure.\n\nWe were at Naples, and my father had taken an odd fancy for a picturesque-looking ruffian who had attracted his attention by a complexion unusually fair for an Italian, and in whom he professed to recognise a likeness to Tasso the poet. This man became his guide in excursions about the neighbourhood of Naples, though he was not one of the regular corps of guides, and indeed seemed to have no regular occupation of a definite sort. \"Tasso,\" as my father always called him, seemed a civil fellow enough, and was fairly intelligent; but my mother disliked him extremely from the first, without being able to offer any very distinct reason for her aversion. In the event her instinct was proved true.\n\n\"Tasso\"--his correct name, by the way, was Tommaso Marino--persuaded my father that something interesting was to be seen at the Astroni crater, four miles west of the city, or thereabout; persuaded him, moreover, to make the journey on foot; and the two accordingly set out. All went well enough till the crater was reached, and then, in a lonely and broken part of the hill, the guide suddenly turned and attacked my father with a knife, his intention, without a doubt, being murder and the acquisition of the Englishman's valuables. Fortunately my father had a hip-pocket with a revolver in it, for he had been warned of the danger a stranger might at that time run wandering in the country about Naples. He received a wound in the flesh of his left arm in an attempt to ward off a stab, and fired, at wrestling distance, with the result that his assailant fell dead on the spot. He left the place with all speed, tying up his arm as he went, sought the British consul at Naples, and informed him of the whole circumstances. From the authorities there was no great difficulty. An examination or two, a few signatures, some particular exertions on the part of the consul, and my father was free, so far as the officers of the law were concerned. But while these formalities were in progress no less than three attempts were made on his life--two by the knife and one by shooting--and in each his escape was little short of miraculous. For the dead ruffian, Marino, had been a member of the dreaded Camorra, and the Camorristi were eager to avenge his death. To anybody acquainted with the internal history of Italy--more particularly the history of the old kingdom of Naples--the name of the Camorra will be familiar enough. It was one of the worst and most powerful of the many powerful and evil secret societies of Italy, and had none of the excuses for existence which have been from time to time put forward on behalf of the others. It was a gigantic club for the commission of crime and the extortion of money. So powerful was it that it actually imposed a regular tax on all food material entering Naples--a tax collected and paid with far more regularity than were any of the taxes due to the lawful Government of the country. The carrying of smuggled goods was a monopoly of the Camorra, a perfect organisation existing for the purpose throughout the kingdom. The whole population was terrorised by this detestable society, which had no less than twelve centres in the city of Naples alone. It contracted for the commission of crime just as systematically and calmly as a railway company contracts for the carriage of merchandise. A murder was so much, according to circumstances, with extras for disposing of the body; arson was dealt in profitably; maimings and kidnappings were carried out with promptitude and despatch; and any diabolical outrage imaginable was a mere matter of price. One of the staple vocations of the concern was of course brigandage. After the coming of Victor Emanuel and the fusion of Italy into one kingdom the Camorra lost some of its power, but for a long time gave considerable trouble. I have heard that in the year after the matters I am describing two hundred Camorristi were banished from Italy.",
    "I woke with a sensation of numbing cold in my right side, a terrible stiffness in my limbs, and a sound of loud splashing in my ears. All was pitch dark, and--what was this? Water! Water all about me. I was lying in six inches of cold water, and more was pouring down upon me from above. My head was afflicted with a splitting ache. But where was I? Why was it dark? And whence all the water? I staggered to my feet, and instantly struck my head against a hard roof above me. I raised my hand; there was the roof or whatever place it was, hard, smooth and cold, and little more than five feet from the floor, so that I bent as I stood. I spread my hand to the side; that was hard, smooth and cold too. And then the conviction struck me like a blow--I was in a covered iron tank, and the water was pouring in to drown me!\n\nI dashed my hands frantically against the lid, and strove to raise it. It would not move. I shouted at the top of my voice, and turned about to feel the extent of my prison. One way I could touch the opposite sides at once easily with my hands, the other way it was wider--perhaps a little more than six feet altogether. What was this? Was this to be my fearful end, cooped in this tank while the water rose by inches to choke me? Already the water was a foot deep. I flung myself at the sides, I beat the pitiless iron with fists, face and head, I screamed and implored. Then it struck me that I might at least stop the inlet of water. I put out my hand and felt the falling stream, then found the inlet and stopped it with my fingers. But water still poured in with a resounding splash; there was another opening at the opposite end, which I could not reach without releasing the one I now held! I was but prolonging my agony. Oh, the devilish cunning that had devised those two inlets, so far apart! Again I beat the sides, broke my nails with tearing at the corners, screamed and entreated in my agony. I was mad, but with no dulling of the senses, for the horrors of my awful, helpless state, overwhelmed my brain, keen and perceptive to every ripple of the unceasing water.\n\nIn the height of my frenzy I held my breath, for I heard a sound from outside. I shouted again--implored some quicker death. Then there was a scraping on the lid above me, and it was raised at one edge, and let in the light of a candle. I sprang from my knees and forced the lid back, and the candle flame danced before me. The candle was held by a dusty man, a workman apparently, who stared at me with scared eyes, and said nothing but, \"Goo' lor'!\"\n\nOverhead were the rafters of a gabled roof, and tilted against them was the thick beam which, jammed across from one sloping rafter to another, had held the tank-lid fast. \"Help me!\" I gasped. \"Help me out!\"\n\nThe man took me by the armpits and hauled me, dripping and half dead, over the edge of the tank, into which the water still poured, making a noise in the hollow iron that half drowned our voices. The man had been at work on the cistern of a neighbouring house, and hearing an uncommon noise, he had climbed through the spaces left in the party walls to give passage along under the roofs to the builders' men. Among the joists at our feet was the trap-door through which, drugged and insensible, I had been carried, to be flung into that horrible cistern.\n\nWith the help of my friend the workman I made shift to climb through by the way he had come. We got back to the house where he had been at work, and there the people gave me brandy and lent me dry clothes. I made haste to send for the police, but when they arrived Mrs. Crofting and her respectable spouse had gone. Some unusual noise in the roof must have warned them. And when the police, following my directions further, got to the offices of Dorrington and Hicks, those acute professional men had gone too, but in such haste that the contents of the office, papers and everything else, had been left just as they stood.",
    "The next was the day before the race, and in the morning Dorrington, making a circuit, came to Mr. Warren Telfer's from the farther side. As soon as they were assured of privacy: \"Have you seen the man with the red beard this morning?\" asked Dorrington.\n\n\"No; I looked out pretty sharply, too.\"\n\n\"That's right. If you like to fall in with my suggestions, however, you shall see him at about two o'clock, and take a handsome rise out of him.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Mr. Telfer replied. \"What's your suggestion?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you. In the first place, what's the value of that other horse that looks so like Janissary?\"\n\n\"Hamid is his name. He's worth--well, what he will fetch. I'll sell him for fifty and be glad of the chance.\"\n\n\"Very good. Then you'll no doubt be glad to risk his health temporarily to make sure of the Redbury Stakes, and to get longer prices for anything you may like to put on between now and to-morrow afternoon. Come to the stables and I'll tell you. But first, is there a place where we may command a view of the ground behind the stables without being seen?\"\n\n\"Yes, there's a ventilation grating at the back of each stall.\"\n\n\"Good! Then we'll watch from Hamid's stall, which will be empty. Select your most wooden-faced and most careful boy, and send him out behind the stable with Hamid at two o'clock to the moment. Put the horse in a full suit of clothes--it is necessary to cover up that white star--and tell the lad he must _lead_ it up and down slowly for twenty yards or so. I rather expect the red-bearded man will be coming along between two o'clock and half-past two. You will understand that Hamid is to be Janissary for the occasion. You must drill your boy to appear a bit of a fool, and to overcome his stable education sufficiently to chatter freely--so long as it is the proper chatter. The man may ask the horse's name, or he may not. Any way, the boy mustn't forget it is Janissary he is leading. You have an odd fad, you must know (and the boy must know it too) in the matter of training. This ridiculous fad is to have your colt walked up and down for half an hour exactly at two o'clock every afternoon, and then given a handful of malt as he comes in. The boy can talk as freely about this as he pleases, and also about the colt's chances, and anything else he likes; and he is to let the stranger come up, talk to the horse, pat him--in short, to do as he pleases. Is that plain?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. You have found out something about this red-bearded chap then?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--it's Naylor the bookmaker, as a matter of fact, with a false beard.\"\n\n\"What! Naylor?\"\n\n\"Yes. You see the idea, of course. Once Naylor thinks he has nobbled the favourite he will lay it to any extent, and the odds will get longer. Then you can make him pay for his little games.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, of course. Though I wouldn't put too much with Naylor in any case. He's not a big man, and he might break and lose me the lot. But I can get it out of the others.\"\n\n\"Just so. You'd better see about schooling your boy now, I think. I'll tell you more presently.\"\n\nA minute or two before two o'clock Dorrington and Telfer, mounted on a pair of steps, were gazing through the ventilation grating of Hamid's stall, while the colt, clothed completely, was led round. Then Dorrington described his operations of the previous evening.\n\n\"No matter what he may think of my tale,\" he said, \"Naylor will be pretty sure to come. He has tried to bribe your stablemen, and has been baffled. Every attempt to get hold of the boy in charge of Janissary has failed, and he will be glad to clutch at any shadow of a chance to save his money now. Once he is here, and the favourite apparently at his mercy, the thing is done. By the way, I expect your nephew's little present to the man you sacked was a fairly innocent one. No doubt he merely asked the man whether Janissary was keeping well, and was thought good enough to win, for I find he is backing it pretty heavily. Naylor came afterwards, with much less innocent intentions, but fortunately you were down on him in time. Several considerations induced me to go to Naylor's room. In the first place, I have heard rather shady tales of his doings on one or two occasions, and he did not seem a sufficiently big man to stand to lose a great deal over your horse. Then, when I saw him, I observed that his figure bore a considerable resemblance to that of the man you had described, except as regards the red beard and the spectacles--articles easily enough assumed, and, indeed, often enough used by the scum of the ring whose trade is welshing. And, apart from these considerations, here, at any rate, was one man who had an interest in keeping your colt from winning, and here was his room waiting for me to explore. So I explored it, and the card turned up trumps.\"\n\nAs he was speaking, the stable-boy, a stolid-looking youngster, was leading Hamid back and forth on the turf before their eyes.\n\n\"There's somebody,\" said Dorrington suddenly, \"over in that clump of trees. Yes--our man, sure enough. I felt pretty sure of him after you had told me that he hadn't thought it worth while to turn up this morning. Here he comes.\"",
    "Dorrington waited no longer, but slipped a pair of thick sock-feet over his shoes, and, after a quick look along the two streets, to make sure nobody was near, he descended the area steps. There was no light in the breakfast-parlour. With his knife he opened the window-catch, raised the sash quietly and stepped over the sill, and stood in the dark room within.\n\nAll was quiet, except for the talking in the room above. He had done but what many thieves--\"parlour-jumpers\"--do every day; but there was more ahead. He made his way silently to the basement passage, and passed into the kitchen. The room was lighted, and cookery utensils were scattered about, but nobody was there. He waited till he heard a request in Naylor's gruff voice for \"another slice\" of something, and noiselessly mounted the stairs. He noticed that the dining-room door was ajar, but passed quickly on to the second flight, and rested on the landing above. Mrs. Naylor would probably have to go downstairs once or twice again, but he did not expect anybody in the upper part of the house just yet. There was a small flight of stairs above the landing whereon he stood, leading to the servant's bedroom and the bathroom. He took a glance at the bathroom with its feeble lamp, its steps, and its open ceiling-trap, and returned again to the bedroom landing. There he stood, waiting watchfully.\n\nTwice the thin woman emerged from the dining-room, went downstairs and came up again, each time with food and plates. Then she went down once more, and was longer gone. Meantime Naylor and Telfer were talking and joking loudly at the table.\n\nWhen once again Dorrington saw the crown of the thin woman's head rising over the bottom stair, he perceived that she bore a tray set with cups already filled with coffee. These she carried into the dining-room, whence presently came the sound of striking matches. After this the conversation seemed to flag, and Telfer's part in it grew less and less, till it ceased altogether, and the house was silent, except for a sound of heavy breathing. Soon this became almost a snore, and then there was a sudden noisy tumble, as of a drunken man; but still the snoring went on, and the Naylors were talking in whispers.\n\nThere was a shuffling and heaving sound, and a chair was knocked over. Then at the dining-room door appeared Naylor, walking backward, and carrying the inert form of Telfer by the shoulders, while the thin woman followed, supporting the feet. Dorrington retreated up the small stair-flight, cocking a pocket revolver as he went.\n\nUp the stairs they came, Naylor puffing and grunting with the exertion, and Telfer still snoring soundly on, till at last, having mounted the top flight, they came in at the bathroom door, where Dorrington stood to receive them, smiling and bowing pleasantly, with his hat in one hand and his revolver in the other.\n\nThe woman, from her position, saw him first, and dropped Telfer's legs with a scream. Naylor turned his head and then also dropped his end. The drugged man fell in a heap, snoring still.\n\nNaylor, astounded and choking, made as if to rush at the interloper, but Dorrington thrust the revolver into his face, and exclaimed, still smiling courteously, \"Mind, mind! It's a dangerous thing, is a revolver, and apt to go off if you run against it!\"\n\nHe stood thus for a second, and then stepped forward and took the woman--who seemed like to swoon--by the arm, and pulled her into the room. \"Come, Mrs. Naylor,\" he said, \"you're not one of the fainting sort, and I think I'd better keep two such clever people as you under my eye, or one of you may get into mischief. Come now, Naylor, we'll talk business.\"\n\nNaylor, now white as a ghost, sat on the edge of the bath, and stared at Dorrington as though in a fascination of terror. His hands rested on the bath at each side, and an odd sound of gurgling came from his thick throat.\n\n\"We will talk business,\" Dorrington resumed. \"Come, you've met me before now, you know--at Redbury. You can't have forgotten Janissary, and the walking exercise and the handful of malt. I'm afraid you're a clumsy sort of rascal, Naylor, though you do your best. I'm a rascal myself (though I don't often confess it), and I assure you that your conceptions are crude as yet. Still, that isn't a bad notion in its way, that of drugging a man and drowning him in your cistern up there in the roof, when you prefer not to pay him his winnings. It has the very considerable merit that, after the body has been fished out of any river you may choose to fling it into, the stupid coroner's jury will never suspect that it was drowned in any other water but that. Just as happened in the Lawrence case, for instance. You remember that, eh? So do I, very well, and it was because I remembered that that I paid you this visit to-night. But you do the thing much too clumsily, really. When I saw a light up here in broad daylight I knew at once it must be left for some purpose to be executed later in the evening; and when I saw the steps carefully placed at the same time, after the servant had been sent out, why the thing was plain, remembering, as I did, the curious coincidence that Mr. Lawrence was drowned the very evening he had been here to take away his winnings. The steps _must_ be intended to give access to the roof, where there was probably a tank to feed the bath, and what more secret place to drown a man than there? And what easier place, so long as the man was well drugged, and there was a strong lid to the tank? As I say, Naylor, your notion was meritorious, but your execution was wretched--perhaps because you had no notion that I was watching you.\"\n\nHe paused, and then went on. \"Come,\" he said, \"collect your scattered faculties, both of you. I shan't hand you over to the police for this little invention of yours; it's too useful an invention to give away to the police. I shan't hand you over, that is to say, as long as you do as I tell you. If you get mutinous, you shall hang, both of you, for the Lawrence business. I may as well tell you that I'm a bit of a scoundrel myself, by way of profession. I don't boast about it, but it's well to be frank in making arrangements of this sort. I'm going to take you into my service. I employ a few agents, and you and your tank may come in very handy from time to time. But we must set it up, with a few improvements, in another house--a house which hasn't quite such an awkward window. And we mustn't execute our little suppressions so regularly on settling-day; it looks suspicious. So as soon as you can get your faculties together we'll talk over this thing.\"",
    "For some days before Dorrington's attention was in any way given to this matter, a poorly-dressed and not altogether prepossessing Frenchman had been haunting the staircase and tapping at the office door, unsuccessfully attempting an interview with Dorrington, who happened to be out, or busy, whenever he called. The man never asked for Hicks, Dorrington's partner; but this was very natural. In the first place, it was always Dorrington who met all strangers and conducted all negotiations, and in the second, Dorrington had just lately, in a case regarding a secret society in Soho, made his name much known and respected, not to say feared, in the foreign colony of that quarter; wherefore it was likely that a man who bore evidence of residence in that neighbourhood should come with the name of Dorrington on his tongue.\n\nThe weather was cold, but the man's clothes were thin and threadbare, and he had no overcoat. His face was of a broad, low type, coarse in feature and small in forehead, and he wore the baggy black linen peaked cap familiar on the heads of men of his class in parts of Paris. He had called unsuccessfully, as I have said, sometimes once, sometimes more frequently, on each of three or four days before he succeeded in seeing Dorrington. At last, however, he intercepted him on the stairs, as Dorrington arrived at about eleven in the morning.\n\n\"Pardon, m'sieu,\" he said, laying his finger on Dorrington's arm, \"it is M. Dorrington--not?\"\n\n\"Well--suppose it is, what then?\" Dorrington never admitted his identity to a stranger without first seeing good cause.\n\n\"I 'ave beesness--very great beesness; beesness of a large profit for you if you please to take it. Where shall I tell it?\"\n\n\"Come in here,\" Dorrington replied, leading the way to his private room. The man did not look like a wealthy client, but that signified nothing. Dorrington had made profitable strokes after introductions even less promising.\n\nThe man followed Dorrington, pulled off his cap, and sat in the chair Dorrington pointed at.\n\n\"In the first place,\" said Dorrington, \"what's your name?\"\n\n\"Ah, yas--but before--all that I tell is for ourselves alone, is it not? It is all in confidence, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" Dorrington answered, with virtuous impatience. \"Whatever is said in this room is regarded as strictly confidential. What's your name?\"\n\n\"Jacques Bouvier.\"\n\n\"Living at----?\"\n\n\"Little Norham Street, Soho.\"\n\n\"And now the business you speak of.\"\n\n\"The beesness is this. My cousin, L\u00e9on Bouvier--he is _coquin_--a rrrascal!\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"He has a great jewel--it is, I have no doubt, a diamond--of a great value. It is not his! There is no right of him to it! It should be mine. If you get it for me one-quarter of it in money shall be yours! And it is of a great value.\"\n\n\"Where does your cousin live? What is he?\"\n\n\"Beck Street, Soho. He has a shop--a caf\u00e9--Caf\u00e9 des Bons Camarades. And he give me not a crrrust--if I starve!\"\n\nIt scarcely seemed likely that the keeper of a little foreign caf\u00e9 in a back street of Soho would be possessed of a jewel a quarter of whose value would be prize enough to tempt Dorrington to take a new case up. But Dorrington bore with the man a little longer. \"What is this jewel you talk of?\" he asked. \"And if you don't know enough about it to be quite sure whether it is a diamond or not, what _do_ you know?\"\n\n\"Listen! The stone I have never seen; but that it is a diamond makes probable. What else so much value? And it is much value that gives my cousin so great care and trouble--_cochon!_ Listen! I relate to you. My father--he was charcoal-burner at Bonneuil, department of Seine. My uncle--the father of my cousin--also was charcoal-burner. The grandfather--charcoal-burner also; and his father and his grandfather before him--all burners of charcoal, at Bonneuil. Now perceive. The father of my grandfather was of the great Revolution--a young man, great among those who stormed the Bastille, the Tuileries, the H\u00f4tel de Ville, brave, and a leader. Now, when palaces were burnt and heads were falling there was naturally much confusion. Things were lost--things of large value. What more natural? While so many were losing the head from the shoulders, it was not strange that some should lose jewels from the neck. And when these things were lost, who might have a greater right to keep them than the young men of the Revolution, the brave, and the leaders, they who did the work?\"\n\n\"If you mean that your respectable great-grandfather stole something, you needn't explain it any more,\" Dorrington said. \"I quite understand.\"\n\n\"I do not say stole; when there is a great revolution a thing is anybody's. But it would not be convenient to tell of it at the time, for the new Government might believe everything to be its own. These things I do not know, you will understand--I suggest an explanation, that is all. After the great Revolution, my great-grandfather lives alone and quiet, and burns the charcoal as before. Why? The jewel is too great to sell so soon. So he gives it to his son and dies. He also, my grandfather, still burns the charcoal. Again, why? Because, as I believe, he is too poor, too common a man to go about openly to sell so great a stone. More, he loves the stone, for with that he is always rich; and so he burns his charcoal and lives contented as his father had done, and he is rich, and nobody knows it. What then? He has two sons. When he dies, which son does he leave the stone to? Each one says it is for himself--that is natural. I say it was for my father. But however that may make itself, my father dies suddenly. He falls in a pit--by accident, says his brother; not by accident, says my mother; and soon after, she dies too. By accident too, perhaps you ask? Oh yes, by accident too, no doubt.\" The man laughed disagreeably. \"So I am left alone, a little boy, to burn charcoal. When I am a bigger boy there comes the great war, and the Prussians besiege Paris. My uncle, he, burning charcoal no more, goes at night, and takes things from the dead Prussians. Perhaps they are not always quite dead when he finds them--perhaps he makes them so. Be that as it will, the Prussians take him one dark night; and they stand him against a garden wall, and pif! paf! they shoot him. That is all of my uncle; but he dies a rich man, and nobody knows. What does his wife do? She has the jewel, and she has a little money that has been got from the dead Prussians. So when the war is over, she comes to London with my cousin, the bad L\u00e9on, and she has the caf\u00e9--Caf\u00e9 des Bons Camarades. And L\u00e9on grows up, and his mother dies, and he has the caf\u00e9, and with the jewel is a rich man--nobody knowing; nobody but me. But, figure to yourself; shall I burn charcoal and starve at Bonneuil with a rich cousin in London--rich with a diamond that should be mine? Not so. I come over, and L\u00e9on, at first he lets me wait at the caf\u00e9. But I do not want that--there is the stone, and I can never see it, never find it. So one day L\u00e9on finds me looking in a box, and--chut! out I go. I tell L\u00e9on that I will share the jewel with him or I will tell the police. He laughs at me--there is no jewel, he says--I am mad. I do not tell the police, for that is to lose it altogether. But I come here and I offer you one quarter of the diamond if you shall get it.\"",
    "At ten precisely next morning, as usual, Mr. Ludwig Hamer mounted the stairs of the house in Hatton Garden, wherein he rented half a room as office. He was a tall, fair man, wearing thick convex _pince-nez_. He spoke English like a native, and, indeed, he called himself an Englishman, though there were those who doubted the Briticism of his name. Scarce had he entered his office when Dorrington followed him.\n\nThe room had never been a very large one, and now a partition divided it in two, leaving a passage at one side only, by the window. On each side of this partition stood a small pedestal table, a couple of chairs, a copying-press, and the other articles usual in a meagrely furnished office. Dorrington strode past Bouvier's half of the room and came upon Hamer as he was hanging his coat on a peg. The letter of introduction had been burnt, since Dorrington had only asked for it in order to get Hamer's name and the Hatton Garden address without betraying to Bouvier the fact that he did not already know all about it.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Hamer,\" said Dorrington, loudly. \"Sorry to see you're not well\"--he pointed familiarly with his stick at a range of medicine bottles on the mantelpiece--\"but it's very trying weather, of course. You've been suffering from toothache, I believe?\"\n\nHamer seemed at first disposed to resent the loudness and familiarity of this speech, but at the reference to toothache he started suddenly and set his lips.\n\n\"Chloroform's a capital thing for toothache, Mr. Hamer, and for--for other things. I'm not in your line of business myself, but I believe it has even been used in the diamond trade.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Hamer, flushing angrily.\n\n\"Mean? Why, bless me--nothing more than I said. By the way, I'm afraid you dropped one of your medicine bottles last night. I've brought it back, though I'm afraid it's past repair. It's a good job you didn't quite clear the label off before you took it out with you, else I might have had a difficulty.\" Dorrington placed the fragments on the table. \"You see you've just left the first letter of 'E.C.' in the druggist's address, and the last 'N' of Hatton Garden, just before it. There doesn't happen to be any other Garden in E.C. district that I know of, nor does the name of any other thoroughfare end in N--they are mostly streets, or lanes, or courts, you see. And there seems to be only one druggist in Hatton Garden--capital fellow, no doubt--the one whose name and address I observe on those bottles on the mantelpiece.\"\n\nDorrington stood with his foot on a chair, and tapped his knee carelessly with his stick. Hamer dropped into the other chair and regarded him with a frown, though his face was pale. Presently he said, in a strained voice, \"Well?\"\n\n\"Yes; there _is_ something else, Mr. Hamer, as you appear to suggest. I see you're wearing a new pair of glasses this morning; pity you broke the others last night, but I've brought the piece you left behind.\" He gathered up the broken bottle, and held up the piece of concave lens. \"I think, after all, it's really best to use a cord with _pince-nez_. It's awkward, and it catches in things, I know, but it saves a breakage, and you're liable to get the glasses knocked off, you know--in certain circumstances.\"\n\nHamer sprang to his feet with a snarl, slammed the door, locked it, and turned on Dorrington. But now Dorrington had a revolver in his hand, though his manner was as genial as ever.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said; \"best to shut the door, of course. People listen, don't they? But sit down again. I'm not anxious to hurt you, and, as you will perceive, you're quite unable to hurt me. What I chiefly came to say is this: last evening my client, M. L\u00e9on Bouvier, of this office and the Caf\u00e9 des Bons Camarades, was attacked in the passage adjoining his house by a man who was waiting for him, with a woman--was it really Mrs. Hamer? but there, I won't ask--keeping watch. He was robbed of a small old wooden box, containing charcoal and--a diamond. My name is Dorrington--firm of Dorrington & Hicks, which you may have heard of. That's my card. I've come to take away that diamond.\"\n\nHamer was pale and angry, but, in his way, was almost as calm as Dorrington. He put down the card without looking at it. \"I don't understand you,\" he said. \"How do you know I've got it?\"\n\n\"Come, come, Mr. Hamer,\" Dorrington replied, rubbing the barrel of his revolver on his knee, \"that's hardly worthy of you. You're a man of business, with a head on your shoulders--the sort of man I like doing business with, in fact. Men like ourselves needn't trifle. I've shown you most of the cards I hold, though not all, I assure you. I'll tell you, if you like, all about your little tour round among the druggists with the convenient toothache, all about the evenings on which you watched Bouvier home, and so on. But, really, need we, as men of the world, descend to such peddling detail?\"\n\n\"Well, suppose I have got it, and suppose I refuse to give it you. What then?\"\n\n\"What then? But why should we talk of unpleasant things? You won't refuse, you know.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you'd get it out of me by help of that pistol?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dorrington, deliberately, \"the pistol is noisy, and it makes a mess, and all that, but it's a useful thing, and I _might_ do it with that, you know, in certain circumstances. But I wasn't thinking of it--there's a much less troublesome way.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"You're a slower man than I took you for, Mr. Hamer--or perhaps you haven't quite appreciated _me_ yet. If I were to go to that window and call the police, what with the little bits of evidence in my pocket, and the other little bits that the druggists who sold the chloroform would give, and the other bits in reserve, that I prefer not to talk about just now--there would be rather an awkwardly complete case of robbery with violence, wouldn't there? And you'd have to lose the diamond after all, to say nothing of a little rest in gaol and general ruination.\"",
    "The track was clear, and dusk was approaching when at last the great Gillett made his appearance on the track. He answered a friendly question or two put to him by Mallows and Stedman, and then, giving his coat to his trainer, swung off along the track on his bicycle, led in front by a tandem and closely attended by a triplet. In fifty yards his pace quickened, and he settled down into a swift even pace, regular as clockwork. Sometimes the tandem and sometimes the triplet went to the front, but Gillett neither checked nor heeded as, nursed by his pacers, who were directed by the trainer from the centre, he swept along mile after mile, each mile in but a few seconds over the two minutes.\n\n\"Look at the action!\" exclaimed Stedman with enthusiasm. \"Just watch him. Not an ounce of power wasted there! Did you ever see more regular ankle work? And did anybody ever sit a machine quite so well as that? Show me a movement anywhere above the hips!\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mr. Mallows, \"Gillett has a wonderful style--a wonderful style, really!\"\n\nThe men in the enclosure wandered about here and there on the grass, watching Gillett's riding as one watches the performance of a great piece of art--which, indeed, was what Gillett's riding was. There were, besides Mallows, Stedman, Dorrington and the trainer, two officials of the Cyclists' Union, an amateur racing man named Sparks, the track superintendent and another man. The sky grew darker, and gloom fell about the track. The machines became invisible, and little could be seen of the riders across the ground but the row of rhythmically working legs and the white cap that Gillett wore. The trainer had just told Stedman that there would be three fast laps and then his man would come off the track.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Stedman,\" said Mr. Mallows, \"I think we shall be all right for Saturday.\"\n\n\"Rather!\" answered Stedman confidently. \"Gillett's going great guns, and steady as a watch!\"\n\nThe pace now suddenly increased. The tandem shot once more to the front, the triplet hung on the rider's flank, and the group of swishing wheels flew round the track at a \"one-fifty\" gait. The spectators turned about, following the riders round the track with their eyes. And then, swinging into the straight from the top bend, the tandem checked suddenly and gave a little jump. Gillett crashed into it from behind, and the triplet, failing to clear, wavered and swung, and crashed over and along the track too. All three machines and six men were involved in one complicated smash.\n\n\nEverybody rushed across the grass, the trainer first. Then the cause of the disaster was seen. Lying on its side on the track, with men and bicycles piled over and against it, was one of the green painted light iron garden-chairs that had been standing in the enclosure. The triplet men were struggling to their feet, and though much cut and shaken, seemed the least hurt of the lot. One of the men of the tandem was insensible, and Gillett, who from his position had got all the worst of it, lay senseless too, badly cut and bruised, and his left arm was broken.\n\n\nThe trainer was cursing and tearing his hair. \"If I knew who'd done this,\" Stedman cried, \"I'd _pulp_ him with that chair!\"\n\n\"Oh, that betting, that betting!\" wailed Mr. Mallows, hopping about distractedly; \"see what it leads people into doing! It can't have been an accident, can it?\"\n\n\"Accident? Skittles! A man doesn't put a chair on a track in the dark and leave it there by accident. Is anybody getting away there from the outside of the track?\"\n\n\"No, there's nobody. He wouldn't wait till this; he's clear off a minute ago and more. Here, Fielders! Shut the outer gate, and we'll see who's about.\"\n\nBut there seemed to be no suspicious character. Indeed, except for the ground-man, his boy, Gillett's trainer, and a racing man, who had just finished dressing in the pavilion, there seemed to be nobody about beyond those whom everybody had seen standing in the enclosure. But there had been ample time for anybody, standing unnoticed at the outer rails, to get across the track in the dark, just after the riders had passed, place the obstruction, and escape before the completion of the lap.\n\n\nThe damaged men were helped or carried into the pavilion, and the damaged machines were dragged after them. \"I will give fifty pounds gladly--more, a hundred,\" said Mr. Mallows, excitedly, \"to anybody who will find out who put that chair on the track. It might have ended in murder. Some wretched bookmaker, I suppose, who has taken too many bets on Gillett. As I've said a thousand times, betting is the curse of all sport nowadays.\"\n\n\"The governor excites himself a great deal about betting and bookmakers,\" Stedman said to Dorrington, as they walked toward the pavilion, \"but, between you and me, I believe some of the 'Avalanche' people are in this. The betting bee is always in Mallows's bonnet, but as a matter of fact there's very little betting at all on cycle races, and what there is is little more than a matter of half-crowns or at most half-sovereigns on the day of the race. No bookmaker ever makes a heavy book first. Still there _may_ be something in it this time, of course. But look at the 'Avalanche' people. With Gillett away their man can certainly win on Saturday, and if only the weather keeps fair he can almost as certainly beat the record; just at present the fifty miles is fairly easy, and it's bound to go soon. Indeed, our intention was that Gillett should pull it down on Saturday. He was a safe winner, bar accidents, and it was good odds on his altering the record, if the weather were any good at all. With Gillett out of it Lant is just about as certain a winner as our man would be if all were well. And there would be a boom for the 'Avalanche' company, on the very eve of the share subscription! Lant, you must know, was very second-rate till this season, but he has improved wonderfully in the last month or two, since he has been with the 'Avalanche' people. Let him win, and they can point to the machine as responsible for it all. 'Here,' they will say in effect, 'is a man who could rarely get in front, even in second-class company, till he rode an 'Avalanche.' Now he beats the world's record for fifty miles on it, and makes rings round the topmost professionals!' Why, it will be worth thousands of capital to them. Of course the subscription of capital won't hurt us, but the loss of the record may, and to have Gillett knocked out like this in the middle of the season is serious.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose with you it is more than a matter of this one race.\"\n\n\"Of course. And so it will be with the 'Avalanche' company. Don't you see, with Gillett probably useless for the rest of the season, Lant will have it all his own way at anything over ten miles. That'll help to boom up the shares and there'll be big profit made on trading in them. Oh, I tell you this thing seems pretty suspicious to me.\"",
    "As the door was pushed open Dorrington advanced and bowed politely. Mallows started guiltily, but, remembering his disguise, steadied himself, and asked gruffly, \"Well, sir, and who are you?\"\n\n\"I,\" answered Dorrington with perfect composure, \"I am Mr. Paul Mallows--you may have heard of me in connection with the 'Indestructible Bicycle Company.'\"\n\nMallows was altogether taken aback. But then it struck him that perhaps the detective, anxious to win the reward he had offered in the matter of the Gillett outrage, was here making inquiries in the assumed character of the man who stood, impenetrably disguised, before him. So after a pause he asked again, a little less gruffly, \"And what may be your business?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dorrington, \"I did think of taking shares in this company. I suppose there would be no objection to the managing director of another company taking shares in this?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Mallows, wondering what all this was to lead to.\n\n\"Of course not; I'm sure _you_ don't think so, eh?\" Dorrington, as he spoke, looked in the other's face with a sly leer, and Mallows began to feel altogether uncomfortable. \"But there's one other thing,\" Dorrington pursued, taking out his pocket-book, though still maintaining his leer in Mallows's face--\"one other thing. And by the way, _will_ you have another piece of court plaster now I've got it out? Don't say no. It's a pleasure to oblige you, really.\" And Dorrington, his leer growing positively fiendish, tapped the side of his nose with the case of court plaster.\n\nMallows paled under the paint, gasped, and felt for support. Dorrington laughed pleasantly. \"Come, come,\" he said, \"don't be frightened. I admire your cleverness, Mr. Mallows, and I shall arrange everything pleasantly, as you will see. And as to the court plaster, if you'd rather not have it you needn't. You have another piece on now, I see. Why didn't you get them to paint it over at Clarkson's? They really did the face very well, though! And there again you were quite right. Such a man as yourself was likely to be recognised in such a place as Birmingham, and that would have been unfortunate for both of us--_both_ of us, I assure you.... Man alive, don't look as though I was going to cut your throat! I'm not, I assure you. You're a smart man of business, and I happen to have spotted a little operation of yours, that's all. I shall arrange easy terms for you.... Pull yourself together and talk business before the men come back. Here, sit on this bench.\"\n\nMallows, staring amazedly in Dorrington's face, suffered himself to be led to a bench, and sat on it.\n\n\"Now,\" said Dorrington, \"the first thing is a little matter of a hundred pounds. That was the reward you promised if I should discover who broke Gillett's arm last night. Well, I _have_. Do you happen to have any notes with you? If not, make it a cheque.\"\n\n\"But--but--how--I mean who--who----\"\n\n\"Tut, tut! Don't waste time, Mr. Mallows. _Who?_ Why, yourself, of course. I knew all about it before I left you last night, though it wasn't quite convenient to claim the reward then, for reasons you'll understand presently. Come, that little hundred!\"\n\n\"But what--what proof have you? I'm not to be bounced like this, you know.\" Mr. Mallows was gathering his faculties again.\n\n\"Proof? Why, man alive, be reasonable! Suppose I have none--none at all? What difference does that make? Am I to walk out and tell your fellow directors where I have met you--here--or am I to have that hundred? More, am I to publish abroad that Mr. Paul Mallows is the moving spirit in the rotten 'Avalanche Bicycle Company'?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Mallows answered reluctantly, \"if you put it like that----\"\n\n\"But I only put it like that to make you see things reasonably. As a matter of fact your connection with this new company is enough to bring your little performance with the iron chair pretty near proof. But I got at it from the other side. See here--you're much too clumsy with your fingers, Mr. Mallows. First you go and tear the tip of your middle finger opening your brougham door, and have to get court plaster from me. Then you let that court plaster get frayed at the edge, and you still keep it on. After that you execute your very successful chair operation. When the eyes of the others are following the bicycles you take the chair in the hand with the plaster on it, catching hold of it at the place where a rough, loose, square nut protrudes, and you pitch it on to the track so clumsily and nervously that the nut carries away the frayed thread of the court plaster with it. Here it is, you see, still in my pocket-book, where I put it last night by the light of the lantern; just a sticky black silk thread, that's all. I've only brought it to show you I'm playing a fair game with you. Of course I might easily have got a witness before I took the thread off the nut, if I had thought you were likely to fight the matter. But I knew you were not. You can't fight, you know, with this bogus company business known to me. So that I am only showing you this thread as an act of grace, to prove that I have stumped you with perfect fairness. And now the hundred. Here's a fountain pen, if you want one.\"\n\n\n\"Well,\" said Mallows glumly, \"I suppose I must, then.\" He took the pen and wrote the cheque. Dorrington blotted it on the pad of his pocket-book and folded it away.\n\n\"So much for that!\" he said. \"That's just a little preliminary, you understand. We've done these little things just as a guarantee of good faith--not necessarily for publication, though you must remember that as yet there's nothing to prevent it. I've done you a turn by finding out who upset those bicycles, as you so ardently wished me to do last night, and you've loyally fulfilled your part of the contract by paying the promised reward--though I must say that you haven't paid with all the delight and pleasure you spoke of at the time. But I'll forgive you that, and now that the little _hors d'oeuvre_ is disposed of, we'll proceed to serious business.\"\n\n\nMallows looked uncomfortably glum.\n\n\n\"But you mustn't look so ashamed of yourself, you know,\" Dorrington said, purposely misinterpreting his glumness. \"It's all business. You were disposed for a little side flutter, so to speak--a little speculation outside your regular business. Well, you mustn't be ashamed of that.\"",
    "He led the way to the room where the body had been found, and paused before the four-armed idol. \"Here's our old friend Hachiman,\" he said, \"whom you half fancied might have had something to do with the tragedy. Well, you were right. Hachiman had a good deal to do with it, and with the various disasters at Copleston's too. I will show you how.\"\n\nThe figure, which was larger than life-size, had been set up temporarily on a large packing-case, hidden by a red cloth covering. Hachiman was represented in the familiar Japanese kneeling-sitting position, and the carving of the whole thing was of an intricate and close description. The god was represented as clad in ancient armour, with a large and loose cloak depending from his shoulders and falling behind in a wilderness of marvellously and deeply carved folds.\n\n\"See here,\" Dorrington said, placing his fingers under a projecting part of the base of the figure, and motioning to Mr. Colson to do the same. \"Lift. Pretty heavy, eh?\"\n\nThe idol was, indeed, enormously heavy, and it must have required the exertions of several strong men to place it where it was. \"It seems pretty solid, doesn't it?\" Dorrington continued. \"But look here.\" He stepped to the back of the image, and, taking a prominent fold of the cloak in one hand, with a quick pull and a simultaneous rap of the other fist two feet above, a great piece of the carved drapery lifted on a hinge near the shoulders, displaying a hollow interior. In a dark corner within a small bottle and a fragment of rag were just visible.\n\n\"See there,\" said Dorrington, \"there wouldn't be enough room in there for you or me, but a small man--a Japanese priest of the old time, say--could squat pretty comfortably. And see!\"--he pointed to a small metal bolt at the bottom of the swing drapery--\"he could bolt himself safely in when he got there. Whether the priest went there to play the oracle, or to blow fire out of Hachiman's mouth and nose I don't know, though no doubt it might be an interesting subject for inquiry; perhaps he did both. You observe the chamber is lined with metal, which does something towards giving the thing its weight, and there are cunning little openings among the armour-joints in front which would transmit air and sound--even permit of a peep out. Now Mr. Deacon might or might not have found out this back door after the figure had been a while in his possession, but it is certain he knew nothing of it when he bought it. Copleston knew nothing of it, though the thing has stood in his place for months. You see it's not a thing one would notice at once--I never should have done so if I hadn't been looking for it.\" He shut the part, and the joints, of irregular outline, fell into the depths of the folds, and vanished as if by magic.\n\n\"Now,\" Dorrington went on, \"as I told you, Copleston knew nothing of this, but one of his men found it out. Do you happen to have heard of one Samuel Castro, nicknamed 'Slackjaw,' a hunchback whom Copleston employed on odd jobs?\"\n\n\"I have seen him here. He called, sometimes with messages, sometimes with parcels. I should probably have forgotten all about him were it not that he was rather an extraordinary creature, even among Copleston's men, who are all remarkable. But did he----\"\n\n\"He murdered Mr. Deacon, I think,\" Dorrington replied, \"as I fancy I can explain to you. But he won't hang for it, for he was drowned this afternoon before my eyes, in an attempt to escape from the police. He was an extraordinary creature, as you have said. He wasn't English--a half-caste of some sort I think--though his command of language, of the riverside and dock description, was very free; it got him his nickname of Slackjaw among the longshoremen. He was desperately excitable, and he had most of the vices, though I don't think he premeditated murder in this case--nothing but robbery. He was immensely strong, although such a little fellow, and sharp in his wits, and he might have had regular work at Copleston's if he had liked, but that wasn't his game--he was too lazy. He would work long enough to earn a shilling or so, and then he would go off to drink the money. So he was a sort of odd on-and-off man at Copleston's--just to run a message or carry something or what not when the regular men were busy. Well, he seems to have been smart enough--or perhaps it was no more than an accident--to find out about Hachiman's back, and he used his knowledge for his own purposes. Copleston couldn't account for missing things in the night--because he never guessed that Castro, by shutting himself up in Hachiman about closing time, had the run of the place when everybody had gone, and could pick up any trifle that looked suitable for the pawnshop in the morning. He could sleep comfortably on sacks or among straw, and thus save the rent of lodgings, and he could accept Hachiman's shelter again just before Copleston turned up to start the next day's business. Getting out, too, after the place was opened, was quite easy, for nobody came to the large store-rooms till something was wanted, and in a large place with many doors and gates, like Copleston's, unperceived going and coming was easy to one who knew the ropes. So that Slackjaw would creep quietly out, and in again by the front door to ask for a job. Copleston noticed how regular he had been every morning for the past few months, and thought he was getting steadier! As to the things that got smashed, I expect Slackjaw knocked them over, getting out in the dark. One china vase, in particular, had been shifted at the last moment, probably after he was in his hiding-place, and stood behind the image. That was smashed, of course. And these things, coming after the bad voyage of the ship in which he came over, very naturally gave poor Hachiman an unlucky reputation.\n\n\"Probably Slackjaw was sorry at first when he heard that Hachiman was bought. But then an idea struck him. He had been to Mr. Deacon's rooms on errands, and must have seen that fine old plate in the sitting-room. He had picked up unconsidered trifles at Copleston's by aid of Hachiman--why not acquire something handsome at Deacon's in the same way? The figure was to be carried to Bedford Mansions as soon as work began on Wednesday morning. Very well. All he had to do was to manage his customary sojourn at Copleston's over Tuesday night, and keep to his hiding-place in the morning. He did it. Perhaps the men swore a bit at the weight of Hachiman, but as the idol weighed several hundredweights by itself, and had not been shifted since it first arrived, they most likely perceived no difference. Hachiman, with Slackjaw comfortably bolted inside him (though even _he_ must have found the quarters narrow) jolted away in the waggon, and in course of time was deposited where it now stands.\"\n\n\n\"Of course all I have told you, and all I am about to tell you, is no more than conjecture--but I think you will say I have reasons. From within the idol Slackjaw could hear Mr. Deacon's movements, and no doubt when he heard him take his hat and stick and shut the outer door behind him, Hachiman's tenant was glad to get out. He had never had so long and trying a sojourn in the idol before, though he _had_ provided himself this time with something to keep his spirits up--in that little flat bottle he left behind. Probably, however, he waited some little time before emerging, for...\"",
    "\"For safety's sake. I judge this because I found no signs of his having started work, except a single small knife-mark on the plate case. He must have no more than begun when Mr. Deacon came back for his letters. First, however, he went and shut the bedroom window, lest his movements might be heard in some adjacent rooms; the man who was painting said he heard that, you remember. Well, hearing Mr. Deacon's key in the lock, of course he made a rush for his hiding-place--but there was no time to get in and close up before Mr. Deacon could hear the noise. Mr. Deacon, as he entered, heard the footsteps in the next room, and went to see. The result you know. Castro, perhaps, crouched behind the idol, and hearing Mr. Deacon approaching, and knowing discovery inevitable, in his mad fear and excitement, snatched the nearest weapon and struck wildly at his pursuer. See! here are half a dozen heavy, short Japanese swords at hand, any one of which might have been used. The thing done, Castro had to think of escape. The door was impossible--the hall-porter was already knocking there. But the man had no key--he could be heard moving about and calling for one. There was yet a little time. He wiped the blade of the weapon, put it back in its place, took the keys from the dead man's pocket, and regained his concealment in the idol. Whether or not he took the keys with the idea of again attempting theft when the room was left empty I don't know--most likely he thought they would aid him in escape. Anyway, he didn't attempt theft, but lay in his concealment--and a pretty bad time he must have had of it--till night. Probably his nerve was not good enough for anything more than simple flight. When all was quiet, he left the rooms and shut the door behind him. Then he lurked about corridors and basements till morning, and when the doors were opened, slipped out unobserved. That's all. It's pretty obvious, once you know about Hachiman's interior.\"\n\n\n\"And how did you find out?\"\n\n\n\"When you left me here I considered the thing. I put aside all suspicions of motive, the Japanese and his sword and the rest of it, and addressed myself to the bare facts. Somebody _had_ been in these rooms when Mr. Deacon came back, and that somebody had murdered him. The first thing was to find how this person came, and where he came from. At first, of course, one thought of the bedroom window, as the police had done. But reflection proved this unlikely. Mr. Deacon had entered his front door, was inside a few seconds, and then was murdered close by the figure of Hachiman. Now if anybody had entered by the window for purposes of robbery, his impulse on hearing the key in the outer door (and such a thing could be heard all over the rooms, as I tested for myself)--his impulse, I say, would be to retreat by the way he had come, that is by the window. If, then, Mr. Deacon had overtaken him before he could escape, the murder might have taken place just as it had done, but it would have been _in the bedroom_, not in a room in the opposite direction. And any thief's attention would naturally be directed at first to the gold plate--indeed, I detected a fresh knife-mark in the door of the case, which I will show you presently. Now, as you see by the arrangement of the rooms, the retreat from the plate case to the bedroom window would be a short one, whereas the murderer must in fact have taken a longer journey in the opposite direction. Why? Because he had _arrived_ from that direction, and his natural impulse was to retreat by the way he had come. This might have been by the door to the back stairs, but a careful examination of this door and its lock and key convinced me that it had not been opened. The key was dirty, and to have turned it from the opposite side would have necessitated the forcible use of a pair of thin hollow pliers (a familiar tool to burglars), and these must have left their mark on the dirty key. So I turned back to the idol. _This_ was the spot the intruder had made for in his retreat, and the figure had been brought into the place the very morning of the murder. Also, things had disappeared from its vicinity at Copleston's. More--it was a large thing. What if it were hollow? One has heard of such things having been invented by priests anxious for certain effects. Could not a thief smuggle himself in that way?\"\n\n\n\"The suggestion was a little startling, for if it were the right one the man might be hiding there at that moment. I gave the thing half an hour's examination, and in the end found what I have shown you. It was not the sort of thing one would have found out without looking for it. Look at it even now. Although you have seen it open, you couldn't point to the joints.\"\n\n\nDorrington opened it again. \"Once open,\" he went on, \"the thing was pretty plain. Here is the rag--perhaps it was Castro's pocket-handkerchief--used to wipe the weapon. It is stained all over, and cut, as you will observe, by the sharp edge. Also, you may see a crumb or two--Slackjaw had brought food with him, in case of a long imprisonment. But chiefly observe the bottle. It is a flat, high-shouldered, 'quartern' bottle, such as publicans sell or lend to their customers in poor districts, and as usual it bears the publican's name--J. Mills. It's a most extraordinary thing, but it seems the fate of almost every murderer, no matter how cunning, to leave some such damning piece of evidence about, foolish as it may seem afterward. I've known it in a dozen cases. Probably Castro, in the dark and in his excitement, forgot it when he quitted his hiding-place. At any rate it helped me and made my course plain. Clearly this man, whoever he was, had come from Copleston's. Moreover, he was a small man, for the space he had occupied would be too little even for a man of middle height. Also he bought drink of J. Mills, a publican; if J. Mills carried on business near Copleston's so much the easier my task would seem. Before I left, however, I went to the basement and inspected the ladder, the removal of which had caused the police so much exercise. Then it was plain why Dowden had cleared out. All his prevarication and uneasiness were explained at once, as the police might have seen if they had looked _behind_ the ladder as well as at it. For it had been lying lengthwise against the wooden partition which formed the back of the compartments put up to serve the tenants as wine-cellars. Dowden had taken three planks out of this partition, and so arranged that they could be slipped in their places and out again without attracting attention. What he had been taking through the holes he thus made I won't undertake to say, but I will make a small bet that some of the tenants find their wine short presently! And so Dowden, never an industrious person, and never at one job long, thought it best to go away when he found the police asking why the ladder had been moved.\"",
    "Before long, finding that the old miser could not leave his bed--indeed he could scarcely turn in it--Greer took courage, in Sinclair's absence, to poke about the place in search of concealed sovereigns. He had no great time for this, because Jerry Cater seemed to have taken a great desire for his company, whether for the sake of his attendance or to keep him out of mischief was not clear. At any rate Greer found no concealed sovereigns, nor anything better than might be sold for a few pence at the ragshop. Until one day, when old Cater was taking alternate fits of restlessness and sleep, Greer ventured to take down a dusty old pickle-jar from the top shelf in the cupboard of his master's bedroom. Cater was dozing at the moment, and Greer, tilting the jar toward the light, saw within a few doubled papers, very dusty. He snatched the papers out, stuffed them into his pocket, replaced the jar, and closed the cupboard door hastily. The door made some little noise, and old Cater turned and woke, and presently he made a shift to sit up in bed, while Greer scratched his head as innocently as he could, and directed his divergent eyes to parts of the room as distant from the cupboard as possible.\n\n\n\"Sam'l Greer,\" said old Cater in a feeble voice, while his lower jaw waggled and twitched, \"Sam'l Greer, I think I'll 'ave some beef-tea.\" He groped tremulously under his pillow, turning his back to Greer, who tip-toed and glared variously over his master's shoulders. He saw nothing, however, though he heard the chink of money. Old Cater turned, with a shilling in his shaking hand. \"Git 'alf a pound o' shin o' beef,\" he said, \"an' go to Green's for it at the other end o' Grange Road, d'ye hear? It's--it's a penny a pound cheaper there than it is anywhere nearer, and--and I ain't in so much of a 'urry for it, so the distance don't matter. Go 'long.\" And old Jerry Cater subsided in a fit of coughing.\n\n\nGreer needed no second bidding. He was anxious to take a peep at the papers he had secreted. Sinclair was out collecting, or trying to collect, but Greer did not stop to examine his prize before he had banged the street door behind him, lest Cater, listening above, should wonder what detained him. But in a convenient courtyard a hundred yards away he drew out the papers and inspected them eagerly. First, there was the policy of insurance of the house and premises. Then there was a bundle of receipts for the yearly insurance premiums. And then--there was old Jerry Cater's will.\n\n\nThere were two foolscap sheets, written all in Jerry Cater's own straggling handwriting. Greer hastily scanned the sheets, and his dirty face grew longer and his squint intensified as he turned over the second sheet, found nothing behind it, and stuffed the papers back in his pocket. For it was plain that not a penny of old Jerry Cater's money was for his faithful servant, Samuel Greer. \"Ungrateful ole waga-bone!\" mused the faithful servant as he went his way. \"Not a blessed 'a'peny; not a 'a'peny! An' them as don't want it gets it, o' course. That's always the way--it's like a-greasing' of a fat pig. I shall 'ave to get what I can while I can, that's all.\" And so ruminating he pursued his way to the butcher's in Grange Road.\n\n\nOnce more on his way there, and twice on his way back, Samuel Greer stepped into retired places to look at those papers again, and at each inspection he grew more thoughtful. There might be money in it yet. Come, he must think it over.\n\n\nThe front door being shut, and Sinclair probably not yet returned, he entered the house by a way familiar to the inmates--a latched door giving on to the wharf. The clock told him that he had been gone nearly an hour, but Sinclair was still absent. When he entered old Cater's room upstairs he found a great change. The old man lay in a state of collapse, choking with a cough that exhausted him; and for this there seemed little wonder, for the window was open, and the room was full of the cold air from the river.\n\n\n\"Wot jer bin openin' the winder for?\" asked Greer in astonishment. \"It's enough to give ye yer death.\" He shut it and returned to the bedside. But though he offered his master the change from the shilling the old man seemed not to see it nor to hear his voice.\n\n\n\"Well, if you won't--don't,\" observed Greer with some alacrity, pocketing the coppers. \"But I'll bet he'll remember right enough presently.\" \"D'y'ear,\" he added, bending over the bed, \"I've got the beef. Shall I bile it now?\"\n\n\nBut old Jerry Cater's eyes still saw nothing and he heard not, though his shrunken chest and shoulders heaved with the last shudders of the cough that had exhausted him. So Greer stepped lightly to the cupboard and restored the fire policy and the receipts to the pickle-jar. He kept the will.\n\n\nGreer made preparations for cooking the beef, and as he did so he encountered another phenomenon. \"Well, he have bin a goin' of it!\" said Greer. \"Blow me if he ain't bin readin' the Bible now!\"\n\n\nA large, ancient, worn old Bible, in a rough calf-skin cover, lay on a chair by old Cater's hand. It had probably been the family Bible of the Caters for generations back, for certainly old Jerry Cater would never have bought such a thing. For many years it had accumulated dust on a distant shelf among certain out-of-date account-books, but Greer had never heard of its being noticed before. \"Feels he goin', that's about it,\" Greer mused as he pitched the Bible back on the shelf to make room for his utensils. \"But I shouldn't ha' thought 'e'd take it sentimental like that--readin' the Bible an' lettin' in the free air of 'eaven to make 'im cough 'isself blind.\"\n\n\nThe beef-tea was set simmering, and still old Cater lay impotent. The fit of prostration was longer than any that had preceded it, and presently Greer thought it might be well to call the doctor. Call him he did accordingly (the surgery was hard by), and the doctor came. Jerry Cater revived a little, sufficiently to recognise the doctor, but it was his last effort. He lived another hour and a half. Greer kept the change and had the beef-tea as well. The doctor gave his opinion that the old man had risen in delirium and had expended his last strength in moving about the room and opening the window.",
    "On the assurance that he had business of extreme importance, Cater took Dorrington into the room in which the old man had died. Cater was using this room as an office in which to examine and balance his uncle's books, and the corpse had been carried to a room below to await the funeral. Dorrington's clothes at this time, as I have hinted, were not distinguished by the excellence of cut and condition that was afterwards noticeable; in point of fact, he was seedy. But his assurance and his presence of mind were fully developed, and it was this very transaction that was to put the elegant appearance within his reach.\n\n\n\"Mr. Cater,\" he said, \"I believe you are sole executor of the will of your uncle, Mr. Jeremiah Cater, who lived in this house.\" Cater assented.\n\n\n\"That will is one extremely favourable to yourself. In fact, by it you become not only sole executor, but practically sole legatee.\"\n\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\n\"I am here as a man of business and as a man of the world to give you certain information. There is a codicil to that will.\"\n\n\nCater started. Then he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as though he knew better.\n\n\n\"There is a codicil,\" Dorrington went on, imperturbably, \"executed in strict form, all in the handwriting of the testator, and dated nine months later than the will. That codicil benefits your cousin, Mr. Jarvis Flint, to the extent of ten thousand pounds. To put it in another way, it deprives _you_ of ten thousand pounds.\"\n\n\nCater felt uneasy, but he did his best to maintain a contemptuous appearance. \"You're rushing ahead pretty fast,\" he said, \"talking about the terms of this codicil, as you call it. What I want to know is, where is it?\"\n\n\n\"That,\" replied Dorrington, smilingly, \"is a question very easily answered. The codicil is in my pocket.\" He tapped his coat as he spoke.\n\n\nPaul Cater started again, and now he was plainly discomposed. \"Very well,\" he said, with some bravado, \"if you've got it you can show it to me, I suppose.\"\n\n\n\"Nothing easier,\" Dorrington responded affably. He stepped to the fireplace and took the poker. \"You won't mind my holding the poker while you inspect the paper, will you?\" he asked politely. \"The fact is, the codicil is of such a nature that I fear a man of your sharp business instincts might be tempted to destroy it, there being no other witness present, unless you had the assurance (which I now give you) that if you as much as touch it I shall stun you with the poker. There is the codicil, which you may read with your hands behind you.\" He spread the paper out on the table, and Cater bent eagerly and read it, growing paler as his eye travelled down the sheet.\n\n\nBefore raising his eyes, however, he collected himself, and as he stood up he said, with affected contempt, \"I don't care a brass farthing for this thing! It's a forgery on the face of it.\"\n\n\n\"Dear me!\" answered Dorrington placidly, recovering the paper and folding it up; \"that's very disappointing to hear. I must take it round to Mr. Flint and see if that is his opinion.\"\n\n\n\"No, you mustn't!\" exclaimed Cater, desperately. \"You say that's a genuine document. Very well. I'm still executor, and you are bound to give it to me.\"\n\n\n\"Precisely,\" Dorrington replied sweetly. \"But in the strict interests of justice I think Mr. Flint, as the person interested, ought to have a look at it first, _in case_ any accident should happen to it in your hands. Don't you?\"\n\n\nCater knew he was in a corner, and his face betrayed it.\n\n\n\"Come,\" said Dorrington in a more business-like tone. \"Here is the case in a nutshell. It is my business, just as it is yours, to get as much as I can for nothing. In pursuance of that business I quietly got hold of this codicil. Nobody but yourself knows I have it, and as to _how_ I got it you needn't ask, for I sha'n't tell you. Here is the document, and it is worth ten thousand pounds to either of two people, yourself and Mr. Flint, your worthy cousin. I am prepared to sell it at a very great sacrifice--to sell it dirt cheap, in fact, and I give you the privilege of first refusal, for which you ought to be grateful. One thousand pounds is the price, and that gives you a profit of nine thousand pounds when you have destroyed the codicil--a noble profit of nine hundred per cent. at a stroke! Come, is it a bargain?\"\n\n\n\"What?\" ejaculated Cater, astounded. \"A thousand pounds?\"\n\n\n\"One thousand pounds exactly,\" replied Dorrington complacently, \"and a penny for the receipt stamp--if you want a receipt.\"\n\n\n\"Oh,\" said Cater, \"you're mad. A thousand pounds! Why, it's absurd!\"\n\n\n\"Think so?\" remarked Dorrington, reaching for his hat. \"Then I must see if Mr. Flint agrees with you, that's all. He's a man of business, and I never heard of his refusing a certain nine hundred per cent. profit yet. Good-day!\"\n\n\n\"No, stop!\" yelled the desperate Cater. \"Don't go. Don't be unreasonable now--say five hundred and I'll write you a cheque.\"\n\n\n\"Won't do,\" answered Dorrington, shaking his head. \"A thousand is the price, and not a penny less. And not by cheque, mind. I understand all moves of that sort. Notes or gold. I wonder at a smart man like yourself expecting me to be so green.\"\n\n\n\"But I haven't the money here.\"\n\n\n\"Very likely not. Where's your bank? We'll go there and get it.\"\n\n\nCater, between his avarice and his fears, was at his wits' end. \"Don't be so hard on me, Mr. Dorrington,\" he whined. \"I'm not a rich man, I assure you. You'll ruin me!\"\n\n\n\"Ruin you? What _do_ you mean? I give you ten thousand pounds for one thousand and you say I ruin you! Really, it seems too ridiculously cheap. If you don't settle quickly, Mr. Cater, I shall raise my terms, I warn you!\"\n\n\nSo it came about that Dorrington and Cater took cab together for a branch bank in Pimlico, whence Dorrington emerged with one thousand pounds in notes and gold, stowed carefully about his person, and Cater with the codicil to his uncle's will, which half an hour later he had safely burnt."

  "Edgar Wallace -- The Keepers of the King's Peace": [
    "To Isongo, which stands upon the tributary of that name, came a woman of the Isisi who had lost her husband through a providential tree falling upon him. I say \"providential,\" for it was notorious that he was an evil man, a drinker of beer and a favourite of many bad persons. Also he made magic in the forest, and was reputedly the familiar of Bashunbi the devil brother of M'shimba-M'shamba. He beat his wives, and once had set fire to his house from sheer wickedness. So that when he was borne back to the village on a grass bier and the women of his house decked themselves with green leaves and arm in arm staggered and stamped through the village street in their death dance, there was a suspicion of hilarity in their song, and a more cheery step in their dance than the occasion called for.\n\nAn old man named D'wiri, who knew every step of every dance, saw this and said in his stern way that it was shameless. But he was old and was, moreover, in fear for the decorum of his own obsequies if these outrageous departures from custom were approved or allowed to pass without reprimand.\n\nWhen M'lama, the wife of G'mami, had seen her lord depart in the canoe for burial in the middle island and had wailed her conventional grief, she washed the dust from her body at the river's edge and went back to her hut. And all that was grief for the dead man was washed away with the dust of mourning.\n\nMany moons came out of the sky, were wasted and died before the woman M'lama showed signs of her gifts. It is said that they appeared one night after a great storm wherein lightning played such strange tricks upon the river that even the old man D'wiri could not remember parallel instances.\n\nIn the night the wife of a hunter named E'sani-Osoni brought a dying child into the hut of the widow. He had been choked by a fish-bone and was *in extremis* when M'lama put her hand upon his head and straightway the bone flew from his mouth, \"and there was a cry terrible to hear--such a cry as a leopard makes when he is pursued by ghosts.\"\n\nA week later a baby girl fell into a terrible fit and M'lama had laid her hand upon it and behold! it slept from that moment.\n\nAhmet, chief of the Government spies, heard of these happenings and came a three days' journey by river to Isongo.\n\n\"What are these stories of miracles?\" he asked.\n\n\"*Capita*,\" said the chief, using the term of regard which is employed in the Belgian Congo, \"this woman M'lama is a true witch and has great gifts, for she raises the dead by the touch of her hand. This I have seen. Also it is said that when U'gomi, the woodcutter, made a fault, cutting his foot in two, this woman healed him marvellously.\"\n\n\"I will see this M'lama,\" said Ahmet importantly.\n\nHe found her in her hut tossing four bones idly. These were the shanks of goats, and each time they fell differently.\n\n\"O Ahmet,\" she said, when he entered, \"you have a wife who is sick, also a first-born boy who does not speak though he is more than six seasons old.\"\n\nAhmet squatted down by her side.\n\n\"Woman,\" said he, \"tell me something that is not the talk of river and I will believe your magic.\"\n\n\"To-morrow your master, the lord Sandi, will send you a book which will give you happiness,\" she said.\n\n\"Every day my lord sends me a book,\" retorted the sceptical Ahmet, \"and each brings me happiness. Also it is common talk that at this time there come messengers carrying bags of silver and salt to pay men according to their services.\"\n\nUndismayed she tried her last shot.\n\n\"You have a crooked finger which none can straighten--behold!\"\n\nShe took his hand in hers and pressed the injured phlange. A sharp pain shot up his arm and he winced, pulling back his hand--but the year-old dislocation which had defied the effort of the coast doctor was straightened out, and though the movement was exquisitely painful he could bend it.\n\n\"I see you are a true witch,\" he said, greatly impressed, for a native has a horror of deformity of any kind, and he sent back word of the phenomenon to Sanders.\n\nSanders at the same time was in receipt of other news which alternately pleased him and filled him with panic. The mail had come in by fast launch and had brought Captain Hamilton of the Houssas a very bulky letter written in a feminine hand. He had broken the glad news to Commissioner Sanders, but that gentleman was not certain in his mind whether the startling intelligence conveyed by the letter was good or bad.\n\n\"I'm sure the country will suit her,\" he said, \"this part of the country at any rate--but what will Bones say?\"\n\n\"Bones!\" repeated Captain Hamilton scornfully. \"What the dickens does it matter what Bones says?\"\n\nNevertheless, he went to the sea-end of the verandah, and his roar rivalled the thunder of the surf.\n\n\"Bones!\"\n\nThere was no answer and for an excellent reason.\n\nSanders came out of the bungalow, his helmet on the back of his head, a cheroot tilted dizzily.\n\n\"Where is he?\" he asked.\n\nHamilton turned.\n\n\"I asked him to--at least I didn't ask him, he volunteered--to peg out a trench line.\"\n\n\"Expect an invasion?\" asked Sanders.\n\nHamilton grinned.\n\n\"Bones does,\" he said. \"He's full of the idea, and offered to give me tips on the way a trench should be dug--he's feeling rotten about things ... you know what I mean. His regiment was at Mons.\"\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said quietly. \"And you ... you're a jolly good soldier, Hamilton--how do you feel about it all?\"\n\nHamilton shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"They would have taken me for the Cameroons, but somebody had to stay,\" he said quietly. \"After all, it is one's business to ... to do one's job in the station of life to which it has pleased God to call him. This is my work ... here.\"\n\nSanders laid his hand on the other's shoulder.\n\n\"That's the game as it should be played,\" he said, and his blue eyes were as soft and as tender as a woman's. \"There is no war here--we are the keepers of the King's peace, Hamilton.\"",
    "Bones, to whom it was put, leapt at the suggestion, brushing aside all objections. They were answered before they were framed.\n\nAs for the girl, she was beside herself with joy.\n\n\"Will there be any fighting?\" she asked breathlessly. \"Shall we be attacked?\"\n\nSanders shook his head smilingly.\n\n\"All you have to do,\" said Bones confidently, \"is to stick to me. Put your faith in old Bones. When you see the battle swayin' an' it isn't certain which way it's goin', look for my jolly old banner wavin' above the stricken field.\"\n\n\"And be sure it _is_ his banner,\" interrupted Hamilton, \"and not his large feet. Now the last time we had a fight....\"\n\nAnd he proceeded to publish and utter a scandalous libel, Bones protesting incoherently the while.\n\nThe expedition was on the point of starting when Hamilton took his junior aside.\n\n\"Bones,\" he said, not unkindly, \"I know you're a whale of a navigator, and all that sort of thing, and my sister, who has an awfully keen sense of humour, would dearly love to see you at the helm of the _Wiggle_, but as the Commissioner wants to make a holiday, I think it would be best if you left the steering to one of the boys.\"\n\nBones drew himself up stiffly.\n\n\"Dear old officer,\" he said aggrieved, \"I cannot think that you wish to speak disparagingly of my intelligence----\"\n\n\"Get that silly idea out of your head,\" said Hamilton. \"That is just what I'm trying to do.\"\n\n\"I'm under your jolly old orders, sir,\" Bones said with the air of an early Christian martyr, \"and according to Paragraph 156 of King's Regulations----\"\n\n\"Don't let us go into that,\" said Hamilton. \"I'm not giving you any commands, I'm merely making a sensible suggestion. Of course, if you want to make an ass of yourself----\"\n\n\"I have never had the slightest inclination that way, cheery old sir,\" said Bones, \"and I'm not likely at my time of life to be influenced by my surroundings.\"\n\nHe saluted again and made his way to the barracks. Bones had a difficulty in packing his stores. In truth they had all been packed before he reached the _Wiggle_, and to an unprofessional eye they were packed very well indeed, but Bones had them turned out and packed *his* way. When that was done, and it was obvious to the meanest intelligence that the _Wiggle_ was in terrible danger of capsizing before she started, the stores were unshipped and rearranged under the directions of the fuming Hamilton.\n\nWhen the third packing was completed, the general effect bore a striking resemblance to the position of the stores as Bones had found them when he came to the boat. When everybody was ready to start, Bones remembered that he had forgotten his log-book, and there was another wait.\n\n\"Have you got everything now?\" asked Sanders wearily, leaning over the rail.\n\n\"Everything, sir,\" said Bones, with a salute to his superior, and a smile to the girl.\n\n\"Have you got your hot-water bottle and your hair-curlers?\" demanded Hamilton offensively.\n\nBones favoured him with a dignified stare, made a signal to the engineer, and the _Wiggle_ started forward, as was her wont, with a jerk which put upon Bones the alternative of making a most undignified sprawl or clutching a very hot smoke-stack. He chose the latter, recovered his balance with an easy grace, punctiliously saluted the tiny flag of the _Zaire_ as he whizzed past her, and under the very eyes of Hamilton, with all the calmness in the world, took the wheel from the steersman's hand and ran the _Wiggle_ ashore.\n\nAll this he did in the brief space of three minutes.\n\n\"And,\" said Hamilton, exasperated to a degree, \"if you'd only broken your infernal head, the accident would have been worth it.\"\n\nIt took half an hour for the _Wiggle_ to get afloat again. She had run up the beach, and it was necessary to unload the stores, carry them back to the quay and reload her again.\n\n\"_Now_ are you ready?\" said Sanders.\n\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" said Bones, abased but nautical.",
    "Bones did not take this in for a moment, for he was gazing open-mouthed at Bucongo. On his head was an indubitable mitre, but around the mitre was bound a strip of skin from which was suspended a circle of dangling monkey tails. For cope he wore a leopard's robe. His face was streaked red with camwood, and around his eyes he had painted two white circles.\n\nHe was in the midst of a frenzied address when the two white visitors came upon the scene, and his hand was outstretched to take the red branding-iron when the girl at Bones's side, with a little gasp of horror, broke into the circle, and wrenching the rough iron from the attendant's hand, flung it towards the circle of spectators, which widened in consequence.\n\n\"How dare you--how dare you!\" she demanded breathlessly, \"you horrible-looking man!\"\n\nBucongo glared at her but said nothing; then he turned to meet Bones.\n\nIn that second of time Bucongo had to make a great decision, and to overcome the habits of a lifetime. Training and education to the dominion of the white man half raised his hand to the salute; something that boiled and bubbled madly and set his shallow brain afire, something that was of his ancestry, wild, unreasoning, brutish, urged other action. Bones had his revolver half drawn when the knobbly end of the chief's killing-spear struck him between the eyes, and he went down on his knees.\n\nThus it came about, that he found himself sitting before Bucongo, his feet and hands tied with native grass, with the girl at his side in no better case.\n\nShe was very frightened, but this she did not show. She had the disadvantage of being unable to understand the light flow of offensive badinage which passed between her captor and Bones.\n\n\"O Tibbetti,\" said Bucongo, \"you see me as a god--I have finished with all white men.\"\n\n\"Soon we shall finish with you, Bucongo,\" said Bones.\n\n\"I cannot die, Tibbetti,\" said the other with easy confidence, \"that is the wonderful thing.\"\n\n\"Other men have said that,\" said Bones in the vernacular, \"and their widows are wives again and have forgotten their widowhood.\"\n\n\"This is a new ju-ju, Tibbetti,\" said Bucongo, a strange light in his eyes. \"I am the greatest of all cross-God men, and it is revealed to me that many shall follow me. Now you and the woman shall be the first of all white people to bear the mark of Bucongo the Blessed. And in the days to be you shall bare your breasts and say, 'Bucongo the Wonderful did this with his beautiful hands.'\"\n\nBones was in a cold sweat and his mouth was dry. He scarcely dare look at the girl by his side.\n\n\"What does he say?\" she asked in a low voice. Bones hesitated, and then haltingly he stammered the translation of the threat.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"O Bucongo,\" said Bones, with a sudden inspiration, \"though you do evil, I will endure. But this you shall do and serve me. Brand me alone upon the chest, and upon the back. For if we be branded separately we are bound to one another, and you see how ugly this woman is with her thin nose and her pale eyes; also she has long hair like the grass which the weaver birds use for their nests.\"\n\nHe spoke loudly, eagerly, and it seemed convincingly, for Bucongo was in doubt. Truly the woman by all standards was very ugly. Her face was white and her lips thin. She was a narrow woman too, he thought, like one underfed.\n\n\"This you shall do for me, Bucongo,\" urged Bones; \"for gods do not do evil things, and it would be bad to marry me to this ugly woman who has no hips and has an evil tongue.\"\n\nBucongo was undecided.\n\n\"A god may do no evil,\" he said; \"but I do not know the ways of white men. If it be true, then I will mark you twice, Tibbetti, and you shall be my man for ever; and the woman I will not touch.\"\n\n\"Cheer oh!\" said Bones.\n\n\"What are you saying--will he let us go?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"I was sayin' what a jolly row there'll be,\" lied Bones; \"and he was sayin' that he couldn't think of hurtin' a charmin' lady like you. Shut your eyes, dear old Miss Hamilton.\"\n\nShe shut them quickly, half fainting with terror, for Bucongo was coming towards them, a blazing iron in his hand, a smile of simple benevolence upon his not unintelligent face.\n\n\"This shall come as a blessing to you, Tibbetti,\" he said almost jovially.\n\nBones shut his teeth and waited.\n\nThe hot iron was scorching his silk shirt when a voice hailed the high-priest of the newest of cults.\n\n\"O Bucongo,\" it said.\n\nBucongo turned with a grimace of fear and cringed backward before the levelled Colt of Mr. Commissioner Sanders.\n\n\"Tell me now,\" said Sanders in his even tone, \"can such a man as you die? Think, Bucongo.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bucongo huskily, \"I think I can die.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Sanders.",
    "He returned to headquarters empty-handed and sat the centre of a chilling group--if we except Patricia Hamilton--and endeavoured, as so many successful advocates have done, to hide his short-comings behind a screen of rhetoric. He came to the part of his narrative where Bosambo was taken ill without creating any notable sensation, save that Sanders's grey eyes narrowed a little and he paid greater heed to the rest of the story.\n\n\"There was poor old Bosambo knocked out, sir--ab-so-lutely done for--fortunately I did not lose my nerve. You know what I am, dear old officer, in moments of crisis?\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Hamilton grimly, \"something between a Welsh revivalist and a dancing dervish.\"\n\n\"Please go on, Bones,\" begged the girl, not the least interested of the audience.\n\n\"I dashed straight back to the _Wiggle_,\" said Bones breathlessly, \"searched for my medicine chest--it wasn't there! Not so much as a mustard plaster--what was I to do, dear old Miss Hamilton?\" he appealed dramatically.\n\n\"Don't tell him, Pat,\" begged Hamilton, \"he's sure to guess it.\"\n\n\"What was I to do? I seized a bottle of brandy,\" said Bones with relish, \"I dashed back to where Bosambo was lyin'. I dashed into the village, into his hut and got a glass----\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" said Sanders impatiently, \"what happened after all this dashing?\"\n\nBones spread out his hands.\n\n\"Bosambo is alive to-day,\" he said simply, \"praisin'--if I may be allowed to boast--the name of Bones the Medicine Man. Look here, sir.\"\n\nHe dragged towards him along the floor of the hut a package covered with a piece of native sacking. This he whisked away and revealed the hideous handiwork of an artist who had carved and painted as true to nature as a man may who is not quite certain whether the human eye is half-way down the nose or merely an appendage to his ear.\n\n\"That, sir,\" said Bones impressively, \"is one of the most interestin' specimens of native work I have ever seen: a gift! From Bosambo to the jolly old doctor man who dragged him, if I might so express it, from the very maws of death.\"\n\nHe made his dramatic pause.\n\nSanders bent down, took a penknife from his pocket and scraped the paint from a flat oblong space on the top.\n\nThere for all men to see--save Bones who was now engaged in a relation of his further adventure to his one sympathizer--was a brass plate, and when the paint had been scraped away, an inscription--\n\n     Department du M\u00e9dicins, Etat CONGO BELGE.\n\nSanders and Hamilton gazed, fascinated and paralysed to silence.\n\n\"I've always had a feelin' I'd like to be a medicine man.\" Bones prattled on. \"You see----\"\n\n\"One moment, Bones,\" interrupted Sanders quietly. \"Did you open this box by any chance?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Bones.\n\n\"And did you see any of its contents?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Bones confidentially, \"that's the most interestin' thing about the box. It contains magic--which, of course, honoured sir and Excellency, is all rubbish.\"\n\nSanders took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and after a few trials opened the case and scrutinized the contents, noting the comforting fact that all the tubes were sealed. He heaved a deep sigh of thankfulness.\n\n\"You didn't by chance discover anything about the missing cultures, Bones?\" he asked mildly.\n\nBones shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and looked disconsolately at his chief.\n\n\"You think I've been feeble, but I haven't lost hope, sir,\" he said, with fine resolution. \"I've got a feelin' that if I were allowed to go into the forest, disguised, sir, as a sort of half-witted native chap, sir----\"\n\n\"Disguised!\" said Hamilton. \"Good Lord, what do you want a disguise for?\"\n\n\nAll night long, between the visits which Bones had been making from the moored _Wiggle_ to the village (feeling the patient's pulse with a profound and professional air and prescribing brandy and milk), Bosambo had been busy.\n\n\"Stand you at the door, Secundi,\" he said to his headman, \"and let one of your men go to the shore to warn me of my lord Tibbetti's coming, for I have work to do. It seems this Maker of Storms were better with Sandi than with me.\"\n\n\"Tibbetti is a fool, I think,\" suggested Secundi.\n\nBosambo, kneeling on a rush mat, busy with a native chisel and a pot of clay paint, looked up.\n\n\"I have beaten older men than you with a stick until they have wept,\" he said, \"and all for less than you say. For this is the truth, Secundi, that a child cannot be a fool, though an old man may be a shame. This is the word of the blessed prophet. As for Tibbetti, he has a clean and loving heart.\"\n\nThere was a rustle at the door and a whispered voice.\n\nThe box and the tools were thrust under a skin rug and Bosambo again became the interesting invalid.\n\nIn the morning Bosambo had said farewell, and a blushing Bones listened with unconcealed pleasure to the extravagant praise of his patient.\n\n\"And this I tell you, Tibbetti,\" said Bosambo, standing thigh-deep in the river by the launch's side, \"that knowing you are wise man who gathers wisdom, I have sent to the end of my country for some rare and beautiful thing that you may carry it with you.\"\n\nHe signalled to a man on the bank, and his servant brought him a curious object.\n\nIt was, Bones noted, a square box apparently of native make, for it was fantastically carved and painted. There were crude heads and hideous forms which never were on land or sea. The paint was brilliant; red, yellow and green indiscriminately splashed.\n\n\"This is very ancient and was brought to my country by certain forest people. It is a Maker of Storms, and is a powerful ju-ju for good and evil.\"\n\nBones, already a collector of native work, was delighted. His delight soothed him for his failure in other respects.",
    "At five o'clock the next morning, when the world was all big hot stars and shadows, and there was no sound but the whisper of the running river and the \"ha-a-a-a--ha-a-a-a\" of breakers, Bones came from his hut, crossed the parade-ground, and, making his way by the light of a lantern along the concrete quay--it was the width of an average table--dropped on to the deck and kicked the custodian of the _Wiggle_ to wakefulness.\n\nBones's satellite was one Ali Abid, who was variously described as Moor, Egyptian, Tripolitan, and Bedouin, but was by all ethnological indications a half-breed Kano, who had spent the greater part of his life in the service of a professor of bacteriology. This professor was something of a purist, and the association with Ali Abid, plus a grounding in the elementary subjects which are taught at St. Joseph's Mission School, Cape Coast Castle, had given Ali a gravity of demeanour and a splendour of vocabulary which many better favoured than he might have envied.\n\n\"Arise,\" quoth Bones, in the cracked bass which he employed whenever he felt called upon to deliver his inaccurate versions of Oriental poets--\n\n     \"Arise, for morning in the bowl of night\n     Has chucked a stone to put the stars to flight.\n     And lo! and lo!... Get up, Ali; the caravan is moving.\n     Oh, make haste!\"\n\n(\"Omar will never be dead so long as Bones quotes him,\" Hamilton once said; \"he simply couldn't afford to be dead and leave it to Bones!\")\n\nAli rose, blinking and shivering, for the early morning was very cold, and he had been sleeping under an old padded dressing-gown which Bones had donated.\n\n\"Muster all the hands,\" said Bones, setting his lantern on the deck.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali slowly, \"the subjects are not at our disposition. Your preliminary instructions presupposed that you had made necessary arrangements _re personnel_.\"\n\nBones scratched his head.\n\n\"Dash my whiskers,\" he said, in his annoyance, \"didn't I tell you that I was taking the honourable lady for a trip? Didn't I tell you, you jolly old slacker, to have everything ready by daybreak? Didn't I issue explicit an' particular instructions about grub?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, \"you didn't.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Bones wrathfully, \"why the dickens do I think I have?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, \"some subjects, when enjoying refreshing coma, possess delirium, hallucinations, highly imaginative, which dissipate when the subject recovers consciousness, but retain in brain cavity illusory reminiscences.\"\n\nBones thrust his face into the other's.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me I dreamt it?\" he hissed.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Ali, \"self-preservation compels complete acquiescence in your diagnosis.\"\n\n\"You're childish,\" said Bones.\n\nHe gave a few vague instructions in the best Bones manner, and stole up to the dark Residency. He had solemnly promised Sanders that he would rouse the girl without waking up the rest of the house.\n\nThey were to go up stream to the Village Island, where the ironworkers of the Akasava had many curious implements to show her. Breakfast was to be taken on the boat, and they were to return for tiffin.\n\nOvernight she had shown Bones the window of her room, and Hamilton had offered to make a chalk mark on the sash, so there could be no mistaking the situation of the room.\n\n\"If you wake me before sunrise, I shall do something I shall be sorry for,\" he warned Bones. \"If you return without straightening the accounts, I shall do something which _you_ will be sorry for.\"\n\nBones remembered this as he crept stealthily along the wooden verandah. To make doubly sure, he took off his boots and dropped them with a crash.\n\n\"Sh!\" said Bones loudly. \"Sh, Bones! Not so much noise, you silly old ass!\"\n\nHe crept softly along the wooden wall and reconnoitred. The middle window was Hamilton's room, the left was Sanders's, the right was Patricia's. He went carefully to the right window and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Still no reply. He knocked loudly.\n\n\"Is that you, Bones?\" growled Sanders's voice.\n\nBones gasped.\n\n\"Awfully sorry, sir,\" he whispered agitatedly--\"my mistake entirely.\"\n\nHe tiptoed to the left window and rapped smartly. Then he whistled, then he rapped again.\n\nHe heard a bed creak, and turned his head modestly away.\n\n\"It's Bones, dear old sister,\" he said, in his loudest whisper. \"Arise, for mornin' in the bowl of light has----\"\n\nHamilton's voice raged at him.\n\n\"I knew it was you, you blithering----\"\n\n\"Dear old officer,\" began Bones, \"awfully sorry! Go to sleep again. Night-night!\"\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" said a muffled voice.\n\nBones, however, went to the middle window; here he could make no mistake. He knocked authoritatively.\n\n\"Hurry up, ma'am,\" he said; \"time is on the wing----\"\n\nThe sash was flung up, and again Bones confronted the furious Hamilton.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the exasperated Bones, \"how the dooce did you get here?\"\n\n\"Don't you know this room has two windows? I told you last night, you goop! Pat sleeps at the other end of the building. I told you that, too, but you've got a brain like wool!\"\n\n\"I am obliged to you, sir,\" said Bones, on his dignity, \"for the information. I will not detain you.\"\n\nHamilton groped on his dressing-table for a hair-brush.\n\n\"Go back to bed, sir,\" said Bones, \"an' don't forget to say your prayers.\"\n\nHe was searching for the window in the other wing of the Residency, when the girl, who had been up and dressed for a quarter of an hour, came softly behind him and tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\"Wow!\" screeched Bones. \"Oh, Lord, dear old sister, you gave me the dickens of a fright! Well, let's get along. Thank heavens, we haven't disturbed anybody.\"\n\nHe was followed to the boat with the imprecations of two pyjamaed figures that stood on the stoep and watched his lank body melt in the darkness.\n\n\"Send us a wireless when you're coming back!\" roared Hamilton.\n\n\"Cad!\" said Bones, between his teeth.",
    "Beyond the far hills, which no man of the Ochori passed, was a range of blue mountains, and behind this again was the L'Mandi country. This adventurous hunting men of the Ochori had seen, standing in a safe place on the edge of the Great King's country. Also N'gombi people, who are notoriously disrespectful of all ghosts save their own, had, upon a time, penetrated the northern forest to a high knoll which Nature had shaped to the resemblance of a hayrick.\n\nA huntsman climbing this after his lawful quarry might gain a nearer view of the blue mountains, all streaked with silver at certain periods of the year, when a hundred streams came leaping with feathery feet from crag to crag to strengthen the forces of the upper river, or, as some said, to create through underground channels the big lakes M'soobo and T'sambi at the back of the N'gombi country.\n\nAnd on summer nights, when the big yellow moon came up and showed all things in her own chaste way, you might see from the knoll of the hayrick these silver ribbons all a-glitter, though the bulk of the mountain was lost to sight.\n\nThe river folk saw little of the L'Mandi, because L'Mandi territory lies behind the country of the Great King, who looked with a jealous eye upon comings and goings in his land, and severely restricted the movement and the communications of his own people.\n\nThe Great King followed his uncle in the government of the pleasant O'Mongo lands, and he had certain advantages and privileges, the significance of which he very imperfectly interpreted.\n\nHis uncle had died suddenly at the hands of Mr. Commissioner Sanders, C.M.G., and the land itself might have passed to the protection of the Crown, for there was gold in the country in large and payable quantities.\n\nThat such a movement was arrested was due largely to the L'Mandi and the influence they were able to exercise upon the European Powers by virtue of their military qualities. Downing Street was all for a permanent occupation of the chief city and the institution of a conventional _r\u00e9gime_; but the L'Mandi snarled, clicked their heels, and made jingling noises with their great swords, and there was at that moment a Government in office in England which was rather impressed by heel-clicking and sword-jingling, and so the territory of the Great King was left intact, and was marked on all maps as Omongoland, and coloured red, as being within the sphere of British influence. On the other hand, the L'Mandi people had it tinted yellow, and described it as an integral portion of the German Colonial Empire.\n\nThere was little communication between L'Mandi and Sanders's territory, but that little was more than enough for the Commissioner, since it took the shape of evangelical incursions carried out by missionaries who were in the happy position of not being obliged to say as much as \"By your leave,\" since they had secured from a Government which was, as I say, impressed by heel-clicking and sword-jingling, an impressive document, charging \"all commissioners, sub-commissioners, magistrates, and officers commanding our native forces,\" to give facilities to these good Christian gentlemen.\n\nThere were missionaries in the Territories who looked askance at their brethren, and Ferguson, of the River Mission, made a journey to headquarters to lay his views upon the subject before the Commissioner.\n\n\"These fellows aren't missionaries at all, Mr. Sanders; they are just political agents utilizing sacred symbols to further a political propaganda.\"\n\n\"That is a Government palaver,\" smiled Sanders, and that was all the satisfaction Ferguson received. Nevertheless, Sanders was watchful, for there were times when the L'Mandi missioners and their friends strayed outside their sphere.\n\nOnce the L'Mandi folk had landed in a village in the middle Ochori, had flogged the headman, and made themselves free of the commodities which the people of the village had put aside for the payment of their taxation.\n\nIn his wrath, Bosambo, the chief, had taken ten war canoes; but Sanders, who had been in the Akasava on a shooting trip, was there before him, and had meted out swift justice to the evil-doers.\n\n\"And let me tell you, Bosambo,\" said Sanders severely, \"that you shall not bring spears except at my word.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo, frankness itself, \"if I disobeyed you, it was because I was too hot to think.\"\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"That I know,\" he said. \"Now I tell you this, Bosambo, and this is the way of very wise men--that when they go to do evil things with a hot heart, they first sleep, and in their sleep their spirits go free and talk with the wise and the dead, and when they wake, their hearts are cool, and they see all the folly of the night, and their eyes are bright for their own faults.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said Bosambo, \"you are my father and my mother, and all the people of the river you carry in your arms. Now I say to you that when I go to do an evil thing I will first sleep, and I will make all my people sleep also.\"\n\nThere are strange stories in circulation as to the manner in which Bosambo carried out this novel reform. There is the story of an Ochori wife-beater who, adjured by his chief, retired to slumber on his grievance, and came to his master the following morning with the information that he had not closed his eyes. Whereupon Bosambo clubbed him insensible, in order that Sanders's plan might have a fair chance.\n\nAt least, this is the story which Hamilton retailed at breakfast one morning. Sanders, appealed to for confirmation, admitted cautiously that he had heard the legend, but did not trouble to make an investigation.\n\n\"The art of governing a native country,\" he said, \"is the art of not asking questions.\"\n\n\"But suppose you want to know something?\" demanded Patricia.\n\n\"Then,\" said Sanders, with a twinkle in his eyes, \"you must pretend that you know.\"",
    "Soon after this Bones came blithely up from the beach and across the parade-ground, his large pipe in his mouth, his cane awhirl. Hamilton watched him from the verandah of the Residency, and called over his shoulder to Patricia. It had been an anxious morning for Bones, and even Hamilton was compelled to confess to himself that he had felt the strain, though he had not mentioned the fact to his sister. Outside in the roadstead the intermediate Elder Dempster boat was waiting the return of the doctor. Bones had been to see him off. An important day, indeed, for Henry Hamilton Bones had been vaccinated.\n\n\"I think it 'took,'\" said Bones gravely, answering the other's question. \"I must say Henry behaved like a gentleman.\"\n\n\"What did Fitz say?\"\n\n(Fitzgerald, the doctor, had come in accordance with his promise to perform the operation.)\n\n\"Fitz?\" said Bones, and his voice trembled. \"Fitz is a cad!\"\n\nHamilton grinned.\n\n\"He said that babies didn't feel pain, and there was Henry howling his young head off. It was horrible!\"\n\nBones wiped his streaming brow with a large and violent bandana, and looked round cautiously.\n\n\"Not a word, Ham, to her!\" he said, in a loud whisper.\n\n\"Sorry!\" said Hamilton, picking up his pipe. \"Her knows.\"\n\n\"Good gad!\" said Bones, in despair, and turned to meet the girl.\n\n\"Oh, Bones!\" she said reproachfully, \"you never told me!\"\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders, opened his mouth, dropped his pipe, blinked, spread out his hands in deprecation, and picked up his pipe. From which it may be gathered that he was agitated.\n\n\"Dear old Miss Hamilton,\" he said tremulously, \"I should be a horrid bounder if I denied Henry Hamilton Bones--poor little chap. If I never mentioned him, dear old sister, it is because----Ah, well, you will never understand.\"\n\nHe hunched his shoulders dejectedly.\n\n\"Don't be an ass, Bones. Why the dickens are you making a mystery of the thing?\" asked Hamilton. \"I'll certify you're a jolly good father to the brat.\"\n\n\"Not 'brat,' dear old sir,\" begged Bones. \"Henry is a human being with a human heart. That boy\"--he wagged his finger solemnly--\"knows me the moment I go into the hut. To see him sit up an' say 'Da!' dear old sister Hamilton,\" he went on incoherently, \"to see him open his mouth with a smile, one tooth through, an' one you can feel with your little finger--why, it's--it's wonderful, jolly old Miss Hamilton! Damn it, it's wonderful!\"\n\n\"Bones!\" cried the shocked girl.\n\n\"I can't help it, madame,\" said Bones miserably. \"Fitz cut his poor little, fat little arm. Oh, Fitz is a low cad! Cut it, my dear old Patricia, mercilessly--yes, mercilessly, brutally, an' the precious little blighter didn't so much as call for the police. Good gad, it was terrible!\"\n\nHis eyes were moist, and he blew his nose with great vigour.\n\n\"I'm sure it was awful,\" she soothed him. \"May I come and see him?\"\n\nBones raised a warning hand, and, though the habitat of the wonderful child could not have been less than half a mile away, lowered his voice.\n\n\"He's asleep--fitfully, but asleep. I've told them to call me if he has a turn for the worse, an' I'm goin' down with a gramophone after dinner, in case the old fellow wants buckin' up. But now he's asleep, thankin' you for your great kindness an' sympathy, dear old miss, in the moment of singular trial.\"\n\nHe took her hand and shook it heartily, tried to say something, and swallowed hard, then, turning, walked from the verandah in the direction of his hut.\n\nThe girl was smiling, but there were tears in her eyes.\n\n\"What a boy!\" she said, half to herself.\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"Bones is very nice,\" he said, and she looked at him curiously.\n\n\"That is almost eloquent,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"I thought it was rather bald,\" he replied. \"You see, few people really understand Bones. I thought, the first time I saw him, that he was a fool. I was wrong. Then I thought he was effeminate. I was wrong again, for he has played the man whenever he was called upon to do so. Bones is one of those rare creatures--a man with all the moral equipment of a good woman.\"\n\nHer eyes were fixed on his, and for a moment they held. Then hers dropped quickly, and she flushed ever so slightly.\n\n\"I think you have defined the perfect man,\" she said, turning the leaves of her book.\n\nThe next morning she was admitted to an audience with that paragon of paragons, Henry Hamilton Bones. He lived in the largest of the Houssa huts at the far end of the lines, and had for attendants two native women, for whom Bones had framed the most stringent and regimental of orders.\n\nThe girl paused in the porch of the hut to read the typewritten regulations which were fastened by drawing-pins to a green baize board. They were bi-lingual, being in English and in coast Arabic, in which dialect Bones was something of a master. The girl wondered why they should be in English.\n\n\"Absolutely necessary, dear old lady friend,\" explained Bones firmly. \"You've no idea what a lot of anxiety I have had. Your dear old brother--God bless him!--is a topping old sport, but with children you can't be too careful, and Ham is awfully thoughtless. There, I've said it!\"\n\nThe English part of the regulations was brief, and she read it through.\n\n*HENRY HAMILTON BONES (Care of).*\n\n1. Visitors are requested to make as little noise as possible. How would you like to be awakened from refreshing sleep! Be unselfish, and put yourself in his place.\n\n2. It is absolutely forbidden to feed the child except with articles a list of which may be obtained on application. Nuts and chocolates are strictly forbidden.\n\n3. The undersigned will not be responsible for articles broken by the child, such as watches. If watches are used to amuse child, they should be held by child's ear, when an interested expression will be observed on child's face.

In lifting child, grasp above waist under arms and raise slowly, taking care that head does not fall back. Bring child close to holder's body, passing left arm under child and right arm over.

Any further information can be obtained at Hut 7.\n\n*(Signed)*\n\n*AUGUSTUS TIBBETTS, Lieutenant.*\n\n\"All based upon my personal observation and experience,\" said Bones triumphantly--\"not a single tip from anybody.\"\n\n\"I think you are really marvellous, Bones,\" said the girl, and meant it.\n\nHenry Hamilton Bones sat upright in a wooden cot. A fat-faced atom of brown humanity, bald-headed and big-eyed, he sucked his thumb and stared at the visitor, and from the visitor to Bones. Bones he regarded with an intelligent interest which dissolved into a fat chuckle of sheer delight.\n\n\"Isn't it--isn't it simply extraordinary?\" demanded Bones ecstatically. \"In all your long an' painful experience, dear old friend an' co-worker, have you ever seen anything like it? When you remember that babies don't open their eyes until three weeks after they're born----\"\n\n\"Da!\" said Henry Hamilton Bones.\n\n\"Da yourself, Henry!\" squawked his foster-father.\n\n\"Do da!\" said Henry.",
    "The palaver was a long and weary one. There were twelve good claimants for the vacant stool of office, and behind the twelve there were kinsmen and spears. From sunset to nigh on sunrise they debated the matter, and Sanders sat patiently through it all, awake and alert. Whether this might be said of Bones is questionable. Bones swears that he did not sleep, and spent the night, chin in hand, turning over the problem in his mind. It is certain he was awake when Sanders gave his summing up.\n\n\"People of this land,\" said Sanders, \"four fires have been burnt since we met, and I have listened to all your words. Now, you know how good it is that there should be one you call chief. Yet, if I take you, M'loomo\"--he turned to one sullen claimant--\"there will be war. And if I take B'songi, there will be killing. And I have come to this mind--that I will appoint a king over you who shall not dwell with you nor overlook you.\"\n\nTwo hundred pairs of eyes watched the Commissioner's face. He saw the gleam of satisfaction which came at this concession to the traditional characteristic of the tribe, and went on, almost completely sure of his ground.\n\n\"He shall dwell far away, and you, the twelve kinsmen of Gulabala, shall reign in his place--one at every noon shall sit in the chief's chair and keep the land for your king, who shall dwell with me.\"\n\nOne of the prospective regents rose.\n\n\"Lord, that is good talk, for so did Sakalaba, the great king of our race, live apart from us at S'furi-S'foosi, and were we not prosperous in those days? Now tell us what man you will set over us.\"\n\nFor one moment Sanders was nonplussed. He was rapidly reviewing the qualifications of all the little chiefs, the headmen, and the fisher leaders who sat under him, and none fulfilled his requirements.\n\nIn that moment of silence an agitated voice whispered in his ear, and Bones's lean hand clutched his sleeve.\n\n\"Sir an' Excellency,\" breathed Bones, all of a twitter, \"don't think I'm takin' advantage of my position, but it's the chance I've been lookin' for, sir. You'd do me an awful favour--you see, sir, I've got his career to consider----\"\n\n\"What on earth----\" began Sanders.\n\n\"Henry Hamilton Bones, sir,\" said Bones tremulously. \"You'd set him up for life, sir. I must think of the child, hang it all! I know I'm a jolly old rotter to put my spoke in----\"\n\nSanders gently released the frenzied grip of his lieutenant, and faced the wondering palaver.\n\n\"Know all people that this day I give to you as king one whom you shall call M'songuri, which means in your tongue 'The Young and the Wise,' and who is called in my tongue N'risu M'ilitani Tibbetti, and this one is a child and well beloved by my lord Tibbetti, being to him as a son, and by M'ilitani and by me, Sandi.\"\n\nHe raised his hand in challenge.\n\n\"Wa! Whose men are you?\" he cried.\n\n\"M'songuri!\"\n\nThe answer came in a deep-throated growl, and the assembly leapt to its feet.\n\n\"Wa! Who rules this land?\"\n\n\"M'songuri!\"\n\nThey locked arms and stamped first with the right foot and then with the left, in token of their acceptance.\n\n\"Take your king,\" said Sanders, \"and build him a beautiful hut, and his spirit shall dwell with you. This palaver is finished.\"\n\nBones was speechless all the way down river. At irregular intervals he would grip Sanders's hand, but he was too full for speech.\n\nHamilton and his sister met the law-givers on the quay.\n\n\"You're back sooner than I expected you, sir,\" said Hamilton. \"Did Bones behave?\"\n\n\"Like a little gentleman,\" said Sanders.\n\n\"Oh, Bones,\" Patricia broke in eagerly, \"Henry has cut another tooth.\"\n\nBones's nod was grave and even distant.\n\n\"I will go and see His Majesty,\" he said. \"I presume he is in the palace?\"\n\nHamilton stared after him.\n\n\"Surely,\" he asked irritably, \"Bones isn't sickening for measles again?\"",
    "\"So I can go to-night, can I?\" said Mr. Corklan. \"That's all right. Now, what about conveyance, hey?\"\n\nBones had now reached the stage where he had ceased to be annoyed, and when he found some interest in the situation. \"What sort of conveyance would you like, sir?\" he asked curiously.\n\n(If you can imagine him pausing half a bar before every \"sir,\" you may value its emphasis.)\n\n\"Isn't there a steamer I can have?\" demanded the man. \"Hasn't Sanders got a Government steamer?\"\n\n\"Pardon my swooning,\" said Bones, sinking into a chair.\n\n\"Well, how am I going to get up?\" asked the man.\n\n\"Are you a good swimmer?\" demanded Bones innocently.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Mr. Corklan, \"you aren't a bad fellow. I rather like you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Bones simply.\n\n\"I rather like you,\" repeated Mr. Corklan. \"You might give me a little help.\"\n\n\"It is very unlikely that I shall,\" said Bones. \"But produce your proposition, dear old adventurer.\"\n\n\"That is just what I am,\" said the other. He bit off the end of another cigar and lit it with the glowing butt of the old one. \"I have knocked about all over the world, and I have done everything. I've now a chance of making a fortune. There is a tribe here called the N'gombi. They live in a wonderful rubber country, and I am told that they have got all the ivory in the world, and stacks of rubber hidden away.\"\n\nNow, it is a fact--and Bones was surprised to hear it related by the stranger--that the N'gombi are great misers and hoarders of elephant tusks. For hundreds of years they have traded ivory and rubber, and every village has its secret storehouse. The Government had tried for years to wheedle the N'gombi into depositing their wealth in some State store, for riches mean war sooner or later. They lived in great forests--the word N'gombi means \"interior\"--in lands full of elephants and rich in rubber trees.\n\n\"You are a regular information bureau,\" said Bones admiringly. \"But what has this to do with your inquiry into the origin of the candy tree?\"\n\nThe man smoked in silence for awhile, then he pulled from his pocket a big map. Again Bones was surprised, because the map he produced was the official map of the Territories. He traced the river with his fat forefinger.\n\n\"Here is the N'gombi country from the east bank of the Isisi, and this is all forest, and a rubber tree to every ten square yards.\"\n\n\"I haven't counted them,\" said Bones, \"but I'll take your word.\"\n\n\"Now, what does this mean?\" Mr. Corklan indicated a twisting line of dots and dashes which began at the junction of the Isisi River and the Great River, and wound tortuously over five hundred miles of country until it struck the Sigi River, which runs through Spanish territory. \"What is that?\" he asked.\n\n\"That, or those,\" said Bones, \"are the footprints of the mighty swoozlum bird that barks with its eyes an' lives on buttered toast an' hardware.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what I know it is,\" said the man, looking up and looking Bones straight in the eye--\"it is one of those secret rivers you are always finding in these 'wet' countries. The natives tell you about 'em, but you never find 'em. They are rivers that only exist about once in a blue moon, when the river is very high and the rains are very heavy. Now, down in the Spanish territory\"--he touched Bones's knee with great emphasis--\"they tell me that their end of the secret river is in flood.\"\n\n\"They will tell you anything in the Spanish territory,\" said Bones pleasantly. \"They'd tell you your jolly old fortune if you'd cross their palms with silver.\"\n\n\"What about your end?\" asked the man, ignoring the scepticism of his host.\n\n\"Our end?\" said Bones. \"Well, you will find out for yourself. I'd hate to disappoint you.\"\n\n\"Now, how am I going up?\" asked the man after a pause.\n\n\"You can hire a canoe, and live on the land, unless you have brought stores.\"\n\nThe man chuckled. \"I've brought no stores. Here, I will show you something,\" he said. \"You are a very good fellow.\" He opened his bag and took out a tight packet which looked like thin skins. There must have been two or three hundred of them. \"That's my speciality,\" he said. He nipped the string that tied them together, stripped one off, and, putting his lips to one end, blew. The skin swelled up like a toy balloon. \"Do you know what that is?\"\n\n\"No, I cannot say I do,\" said Bones.\n\n\"You have heard of Soemmering's process?\"\n\nBones shook his head.\n\n\"Do you know what decimal 1986 signifies?\"\n\n\"You've got me guessing, my lad,\" said Bones admiringly.\n\nThe other chuckled, threw the skins into his bag, and closed it with a snap. \"That's my little joke,\" he said. \"All my friends tell me it will be the death of me one of these days. I like to puzzle people\"--he smiled amiably and triumphantly in Bones's face--\"I like to tell them the truth in such a way they don't understand it. If they understood it--Heavens, there'd be the devil to pay!\"\n\n\"You are an ingenious fellow,\" said Bones, \"but I don't like your face. You will forgive my frankness, dear old friend.\"\n\n\"Faces aren't fortunes,\" said the other complacently, \"and I am going out of this country with money sticking to me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for you,\" said Bones, shaking his head; \"I hate to see fellows with illusions.\""

  "Jules Verne -- Five Weeks in a Balloon": [
    "There was a large audience assembled on the 14th of January, 1862, at the session of the Royal Geographical Society, No. 3 Waterloo Place, London. The president, Sir Francis M\u2014\u2014, made an important communication to his colleagues, in an address that was frequently interrupted by applause.\n\nThis rare specimen of eloquence terminated with the following sonorous phrases bubbling over with patriotism:\n\n\u201cEngland has always marched at the head of nations\u201d (for, the reader will observe, the nations always march at the head of each other), \u201cby the intrepidity of her explorers in the line of geographical discovery.\u201d (General assent). \u201cDr. Samuel Ferguson, one of her most glorious sons, will not reflect discredit on his origin.\u201d (\u201cNo, indeed!\u201d from all parts of the hall.) \u201cThis attempt, should it succeed\u201d (\u201cIt will succeed!\u201d), \u201cwill complete and link together the notions, as yet disjointed, which the world entertains of African cartology\u201d (vehement applause); \u201cand, should it fail, it will, at least, remain on record as one of the most daring conceptions of human genius!\u201d (Tremendous cheering.)\n\n\u201cHuzza! huzza!\u201d shouted the immense audience, completely electrified by these inspiring words.\n\n\u201cHuzza for the intrepid Ferguson!\u201d cried one of the most excitable of the enthusiastic crowd.\n\nThe wildest cheering resounded on all sides; the name of Ferguson was in every mouth, and we may safely believe that it lost nothing in passing through English throats. Indeed, the hall fairly shook with it.\n\nAnd there were present, also, those fearless travellers and explorers whose energetic temperaments had borne them through every quarter of the globe, many of them grown old and worn out in the service of science. All had, in some degree, physically or morally, undergone the sorest trials. They had escaped shipwreck; conflagration; Indian tomahawks and war-clubs; the fagot and the stake; nay, even the cannibal maws of the South Sea Islanders. But still their hearts beat high during Sir Francis M\u2014\u2014\u2019s address, which certainly was the finest oratorical success that the Royal Geographical Society of London had yet achieved.\n\nBut, in England, enthusiasm does not stop short with mere words. It strikes off money faster than the dies of the Royal Mint itself. So a subscription to encourage Dr. Ferguson was voted there and then, and it at once attained the handsome amount of two thousand five hundred pounds. The sum was made commensurate with the importance of the enterprise.\n\nA member of the Society then inquired of the president whether Dr. Ferguson was not to be officially introduced.\n\n\u201cThe doctor is at the disposition of the meeting,\u201d replied Sir Francis.\n\n\u201cLet him come in, then! Bring him in!\u201d shouted the audience. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see a man of such extraordinary daring, face to face!\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps this incredible proposition of his is only intended to mystify us,\u201d growled an apoplectic old admiral.\n\n\u201cSuppose that there should turn out to be no such person as Dr. Ferguson?\u201d exclaimed another voice, with a malicious twang.\n\n\u201cWhy, then, we\u2019d have to invent one!\u201d replied a facetious member of this grave Society.\n\n\u201cAsk Dr. Ferguson to come in,\u201d was the quiet remark of Sir Francis M\u2014\u2014.\n\nAnd come in the doctor did, and stood there, quite unmoved by the thunders of applause that greeted his appearance.\n\nHe was a man of about forty years of age, of medium height and physique. His sanguine temperament was disclosed in the deep color of his cheeks. His countenance was coldly expressive, with regular features, and a large nose\u2014one of those noses that resemble the prow of a ship, and stamp the faces of men predestined to accomplish great discoveries. His eyes, which were gentle and intelligent, rather than bold, lent a peculiar charm to his physiognomy. His arms were long, and his feet were planted with that solidity which indicates a great pedestrian.\n\nA calm gravity seemed to surround the doctor\u2019s entire person, and no one would dream that he could become the agent of any mystification, however harmless.\n\nHence, the applause that greeted him at the outset continued until he, with a friendly gesture, claimed silence on his own behalf. He stepped toward the seat that had been prepared for him on his presentation, and then, standing erect and motionless, he, with a determined glance, pointed his right forefinger upward, and pronounced aloud the single word\u2014\n\n\u201cExcelsior!\u201d\n\nNever had one of Bright\u2019s or Cobden\u2019s sudden onslaughts, never had one of Palmerston\u2019s abrupt demands for funds to plate the rocks of the English coast with iron, made such a sensation. Sir Francis M\u2014\u2014\u2018s address was completely overshadowed. The doctor had shown himself moderate, sublime, and self-contained, in one; he had uttered the word of the situation\u2014\n\n\u201cExcelsior!\u201d\n\nThe gouty old admiral who had been finding fault, was completely won over by the singular man before him, and immediately moved the insertion of Dr. Ferguson\u2019s speech in \u201cThe Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London.\u201d",
    "Dr. Ferguson had long been engaged upon the details of his expedition. It is easy to comprehend that the balloon\u2014that marvellous vehicle which was to convey him through the air\u2014was the constant object of his solicitude.\n\nAt the outset, in order not to give the balloon too ponderous dimensions, he had decided to fill it with hydrogen gas, which is fourteen and a half times lighter than common air. The production of this gas is easy, and it has given the greatest satisfaction hitherto in aerostatic experiments.\n\nThe doctor, according to very accurate calculations, found that, including the articles indispensable to his journey and his apparatus, he should have to carry a weight of 4,000 pounds; therefore he had to find out what would be the ascensional force of a balloon capable of raising such a weight, and, consequently, what would be its capacity.\n\nA weight of four thousand pounds is represented by a displacement of the air amounting to forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet; or, in other words, forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet of air weigh about four thousand pounds.\n\nBy giving the balloon these cubic dimensions, and filling it with hydrogen gas, instead of common air\u2014the former being fourteen and a half times lighter and weighing therefore only two hundred and seventy-six pounds\u2014a difference of three thousand seven hundred and twenty-four pounds in equilibrium is produced; and it is this difference between the weight of the gas contained in the balloon and the weight of the surrounding atmosphere that constitutes the ascensional force of the former.\n\nHowever, were the forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet of gas of which we speak, all introduced into the balloon, it would be entirely filled; but that would not do, because, as the balloon continued to mount into the more rarefied layers of the atmosphere, the gas within would dilate, and soon burst the cover containing it. Balloons, then, are usually only two-thirds filled.\n\nBut the doctor, in carrying out a project known only to himself, resolved to fill his balloon only one-half; and, since he had to carry forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet of gas, to give his balloon nearly double capacity he arranged it in that elongated, oval shape which has come to be preferred. The horizontal diameter was fifty feet, and the vertical diameter seventy-five feet. He thus obtained a spheroid, the capacity of which amounted, in round numbers, to ninety thousand cubic feet.\n\nCould Dr. Ferguson have used two balloons, his chances of success would have been increased; for, should one burst in the air, he could, by throwing out ballast, keep himself up with the other. But the management of two balloons would, necessarily, be very difficult, in view of the problem how to keep them both at an equal ascensional force.\n\nAfter having pondered the matter carefully, Dr. Ferguson, by an ingenious arrangement, combined the advantages of two balloons, without incurring their inconveniences. He constructed two of different sizes, and inclosed the smaller in the larger one. His external balloon, which had the dimensions given above, contained a less one of the same shape, which was only forty-five feet in horizontal, and sixty-eight feet in vertical diameter. The capacity of this interior balloon was only sixty-seven thousand cubic feet: it was to float in the fluid surrounding it. A valve opened from one balloon into the other, and thus enabled the a\u00ebronaut to communicate with both.\n\nThis arrangement offered the advantage, that if gas had to be let off, so as to descend, that which was in the outer balloon would go first; and, were it completely emptied, the smaller one would still remain intact. The outer envelope might then be cast off as a useless encumbrance; and the second balloon, left free to itself, would not offer the same hold to the currents of air as a half-inflated one must needs present.\n\nMoreover, in case of an accident happening to the outside balloon, such as getting torn, for instance, the other would remain intact.\n\nThe balloons were made of a strong but light Lyons silk, coated with gutta percha. This gummy, resinous substance is absolutely water-proof, and also resists acids and gas perfectly. The silk was doubled, at the upper extremity of the oval, where most of the strain would come.\n\nSuch an envelope as this could retain the inflating fluid for any length of time. It weighed half a pound per nine square feet. Hence the surface of the outside balloon being about eleven thousand six hundred square feet, its envelope weighed six hundred and fifty pounds. The envelope of the second or inner balloon, having nine thousand two hundred square feet of surface, weighed only about five hundred and ten pounds, or say eleven hundred and sixty pounds for both.\n\nThe network that supported the car was made of very strong hempen cord, and the two valves were the object of the most minute and careful attention, as the rudder of a ship would be.\n\nThe car, which was of a circular form and fifteen feet in diameter, was made of wicker-work, strengthened with a slight covering of iron, and protected below by a system of elastic springs, to deaden the shock of collision. Its weight, along with that of the network, did not exceed two hundred and fifty pounds.\n\nIn addition to the above, the doctor caused to be constructed two sheet-iron chests two lines in thickness. These were connected by means of pipes furnished with stopcocks. He joined to these a spiral, two inches in diameter, which terminated in two branch pieces of unequal length, the longer of which, however, was twenty-five feet in height and the shorter only fifteen feet.\n\nThese sheet-iron chests were embedded in the car in such a way as to take up the least possible amount of space. The spiral, which was not to be adjusted until some future moment, was packed up, separately, along with a very strong Buntzen electric battery. This apparatus had been so ingeniously combined that it did not weigh more than seven hundred pounds, even including twenty-five gallons of water in another receptacle.",
    "About six o\u2019clock in the evening, the captain assembled the travellers and the officers of the ship at a farewell repast in his cabin. Kennedy, whom nobody ventured to question now, sat with his eyes riveted on Dr. Ferguson, murmuring indistinguishable words. In other respects, the dinner was a gloomy one. The approach of the final moment filled everybody with the most serious reflections. What had fate in store for these daring adventurers? Should they ever again find themselves in the midst of their friends, or seated at the domestic hearth? Were their travelling apparatus to fail, what would become of them, among those ferocious savage tribes, in regions that had never been explored, and in the midst of boundless deserts?\n\nSuch thoughts as these, which had been dim and vague until then, or but slightly regarded when they came up, returned upon their excited fancies with intense force at this parting moment. Dr. Ferguson, still cold and impassible, talked of this, that, and the other; but he strove in vain to overcome this infectious gloominess. He utterly failed.\n\nAs some demonstration against the personal safety of the doctor and his companions was feared, all three slept that night on board the _Resolute_. At six o\u2019clock in the morning they left their cabin, and landed on the island of Koumbeni.\n\nThe balloon was swaying gently to and fro in the morning breeze; the sand-bags that had held it down were now replaced by some twenty strong-armed sailors, and Captain Bennet and his officers were present to witness the solemn departure of their friends.\n\nAt this moment Kennedy went right up to the doctor, grasped his hand, and said:\n\n\u201cSamuel, have you absolutely determined to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cSolemnly determined, my dear Dick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done every thing that I could to prevent this expedition, have I not?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery thing!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, my conscience is clear on that score, and I will go with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was sure you would!\u201d said the doctor, betraying in his features swift traces of emotion.\n\nAt last the moment of final leave-taking arrived. The captain and his officers embraced their dauntless friends with great feeling, not excepting even Joe, who, worthy fellow, was as proud and happy as a prince. Every one in the party insisted upon having a final shake of the doctor\u2019s hand.\n\nAt nine o\u2019clock the three travellers got into their car. The doctor lit the combustible in his cylinder and turned the flame so as to produce a rapid heat, and the balloon, which had rested on the ground in perfect equipoise, began to rise in a few minutes, so that the seamen had to slacken the ropes they held it by. The car then rose about twenty feet above their heads.\n\n\u201cMy friends!\u201d exclaimed the doctor, standing up between his two companions, and taking off his hat, \u201clet us give our a\u00ebrial ship a name that will bring her good luck! let us christen her _Victoria!_\u201d\n\nThis speech was answered with stentorian cheers of \u201cHuzza for the Queen! Huzza for Old England!\u201d\n\nAt this moment the ascensional force of the balloon increased prodigiously, and Ferguson, Kennedy, and Joe, waved a last good-by to their friends.\n\n\u201cLet go all!\u201d shouted the doctor, and at the word the _Victoria_ shot rapidly up into the sky, while the four carronades on board the _Resolute_ thundered forth a parting salute in her honor.",
    "The balloon made little progress, and the wind seemed as though unwilling to jostle its precious burden. Toward evening, Joe discovered a great light in the west. Under more elevated latitudes, it might have been mistaken for an immense aurora borealis, for the sky appeared on fire. The doctor very attentively examined the phenomenon. \u201cIt is, perhaps, only a volcano in full activity,\u201d said he. \u201cBut the wind is carrying us directly over it,\u201d replied Kennedy. \u201cVery well, we shall cross it then at a safe height!\u201d said the doctor.\n\nThree hours later, the _Victoria_ was right among the mountains. Her exact position was twenty-four degrees fifteen minutes east longitude, and four degrees forty-two minutes north latitude, and four degrees forty-two minutes north latitude. In front of her a volcanic crater was pouring forth torrents of melted lava, and hurling masses of rock to an enormous height. There were jets, too, of liquid fire that fell back in dazzling cascades\u2014a superb but dangerous spectacle, for the wind with unswerving certainty was carrying the balloon directly toward this blazing atmosphere. This obstacle, which could not be turned, had to be crossed, so the cylinder was put to its utmost power, and the balloon rose to the height of six thousand feet, leaving between it and the volcano a space of more than three hundred fathoms.\n\nFrom his bed of suffering, the dying missionary could contemplate that fiery crater from which a thousand jets of dazzling flame were that moment escaping. \u201cHow grand it is!\u201d said he, \u201cand how infinite is the power of God even in its most terrible manifestations!\u201d This overflow of blazing lava wrapped the sides of the mountain with a veritable drapery of flame; the lower half of the balloon glowed redly in the upper night; a torrid heat ascended to the car, and Dr. Ferguson made all possible haste to escape from this perilous situation. By ten o\u2019clock the volcano could be seen only as a red point on the horizon, and the balloon tranquilly pursued her course in a less elevated zone of the atmosphere.\n\n\nA magnificent night overspread the earth, and the missionary lay quietly asleep in utter exhaustion. \u201cHe\u2019ll not get over it!\u201d sighed Joe. \u201cPoor young fellow\u2014scarcely thirty years of age!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll die in our arms. His breathing, which was so feeble before, is growing weaker still, and I can do nothing to save him,\u201d said the doctor, despairingly. \u201cThe infamous scoundrels!\u201d exclaimed Joe, grinding his teeth, in one of those fits of rage that came over him at long intervals; \u201cand to think that, in spite of all, this good man could find words only to pity them, to excuse, to pardon them!\u201d \u201cHeaven has given him a lovely night, Joe\u2014his last on earth, perhaps! He will suffer but little more after this, and his dying will be only a peaceful falling asleep.\u201d\n\nThe dying man uttered some broken words, and the doctor at once went to him. His breathing became difficult, and he asked for air. The curtains were drawn entirely back, and he inhaled with rapture the light breezes of that clear, beautiful night. The stars sent him their trembling rays, and the moon wrapped him in the white winding-sheet of its effulgence. \u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, in an enfeebled voice, \u201cI am going. May God requite you, and bring you to your safe harbor! May he pay for me the debt of gratitude that I owe to you!\u201d \u201cYou must still hope,\u201d replied Kennedy. \u201cThis is but a passing fit of weakness. You will not die. How could any one die on this beautiful summer night?\u201d \u201cDeath is at hand,\u201d replied the missionary, \u201cI know it! Let me look it in the face! Death, the commencement of things eternal, is but the end of earthly cares. Place me upon my knees, my brethren, I beseech you!\u201d\n\nKennedy lifted him up, and it was distressing to see his weakened limbs bend under him. \u201cMy God! my God!\u201d exclaimed the dying apostle, \u201chave pity on me!\u201d His countenance shone. Far above that earth on which he had known no joys; in the midst of that night which sent to him its softest radiance; on the way to that heaven toward which he uplifted his spirit, as though in a miraculous assumption, he seemed already to live and breathe in the new existence. His last gesture was a supreme blessing on his new friends of only one day. Then he fell back into the arms of Kennedy, whose countenance was bathed in hot tears. \u201cDead!\u201d said the doctor, bending over him, \u201cdead!\u201d And with one common accord, the three friends knelt together in silent prayer. \u201cTo-morrow,\u201d resumed the doctor, \u201cwe shall bury him in the African soil which he has besprinkled with his blood.\u201d\n\nDuring the rest of the night the body was watched, turn by turn, by the three travellers, and not a word disturbed the solemn silence. Each of them was weeping. The next day the wind came from the south, and the balloon moved slowly over a vast plateau of mountains: there, were extinct craters; here, barren ravines; not a drop of water on those parched crests; piles of broken rocks; huge stony masses scattered hither and thither, and, interspersed with whitish marl, all indicated the most complete sterility.",
    "Toward noon, the doctor, for the purpose of burying the body, decided to descend into a ravine, in the midst of some plutonic rocks of primitive formation. The surrounding mountains would shelter him, and enable him to bring his car to the ground, for there was no tree in sight to which he could make it fast. But, as he had explained to Kennedy, it was now impossible for him to descend, except by releasing a quantity of gas proportionate to his loss of ballast at the time when he had rescued the missionary. He therefore opened the valve of the outside balloon. The hydrogen escaped, and the _Victoria_ quietly descended into the ravine.\n\nAs soon as the car touched the ground, the doctor shut the valve. Joe leaped out, holding on the while to the rim of the car with one hand, and with the other gathering up a quantity of stones equal to his own weight. He could then use both hands, and had soon heaped into the car more than five hundred pounds of stones, which enabled both the doctor and Kennedy, in their turn, to get out. Thus the _Victoria_ found herself balanced, and her ascensional force insufficient to raise her. Moreover, it was not necessary to gather many of these stones, for the blocks were extremely heavy, so much so, indeed, that the doctor\u2019s attention was attracted by the circumstance. The soil, in fact, was bestrewn with quartz and porphyritic rocks. \u201cThis is a singular discovery!\u201d said the doctor, mentally.\n\nIn the mean while, Kennedy and Joe had strolled away a few paces, looking up a proper spot for the grave. The heat was extreme in this ravine, shut in as it was like a sort of furnace. The noonday sun poured down its rays perpendicularly into it. The first thing to be done was to clear the surface of the fragments of rock that encumbered it, and then a quite deep grave had to be dug, so that the wild animals should not be able to disinter the corpse. The body of the martyred missionary was then solemnly placed in it. The earth was thrown in over his remains, and above it masses of rock were deposited, in rude resemblance to a tomb.\n\nThe doctor, however, remained motionless, and lost in his reflections. He did not even heed the call of his companions, nor did he return with them to seek a shelter from the heat of the day. \u201cWhat are you thinking about, doctor?\u201d asked Kennedy. \u201cAbout a singular freak of Nature, a curious effect of chance. Do you know, now, in what kind of soil that man of self-denial, that poor one in spirit, has just been buried?\u201d \u201cNo! what do you mean, doctor?\u201d \u201cThat priest, who took the oath of perpetual poverty, now reposes in a gold-mine!\u201d \u201cA gold-mine!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy and Joe in one breath. \u201cYes, a gold-mine,\u201d said the doctor, quietly. \u201cThose blocks which you are trampling under foot, like worthless stones, contain gold-ore of great purity.\u201d \u201cImpossible! impossible!\u201d repeated Joe. \u201cYou would not have to look long among those fissures of slaty schist without finding peptites of considerable value.\u201d\n\nJoe at once rushed like a crazy man among the scattered fragments, and Kennedy was not long in following his example. \u201cKeep cool, Joe,\u201d said his master. \u201cWhy, doctor, you speak of the thing quite at your ease.\u201d \u201cWhat! a philosopher of your mettle\u2014\u201d \u201cAh, master, no philosophy holds good in this case!\u201d \u201cCome! come! Let us reflect a little. What good would all this wealth do you? We cannot carry any of it away with us.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t take any of it with us, indeed?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s rather too heavy for our car! I even hesitated to tell you any thing about it, for fear of exciting your regret!\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said Joe, again, \u201cabandon these treasures\u2014a fortune for us!\u2014really for us\u2014our own\u2014leave it behind!\u201d \u201cTake care, my friend! Would you yield to the thirst for gold? Has not this dead man whom you have just helped to bury, taught you the vanity of human affairs?\u201d \u201cAll that is true,\u201d replied Joe, \u201cbut gold! Mr. Kennedy, won\u2019t you help to gather up a trifle of all these millions?\u201d \u201cWhat could we do with them, Joe?\u201d said the hunter, unable to repress a smile. \u201cWe did not come hither in search of fortune, and we cannot take one home with us.\u201d \u201cThe millions are rather heavy, you know,\u201d resumed the doctor, \u201cand cannot very easily be put into one\u2019s pocket.\u201d \u201cBut, at least,\u201d said Joe, driven to his last defences, \u201ccouldn\u2019t we take some of that ore for ballast, instead of sand?\u201d \u201cVery good! I consent,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cbut you must not make too many wry faces when we come to throw some thousands of crowns\u2019 worth overboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThousands of crowns!\u201d echoed Joe; \u201cis it possible that there is so much gold in them, and that all this is the same?\u201d \u201cYes, my friend, this is a reservoir in which Nature has been heaping up her wealth for centuries! There is enough here to enrich whole nations! An Australia and a California both together in the midst of the wilderness!\u201d \u201cAnd the whole of it is to remain useless!\u201d \u201cPerhaps! but at all events, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do to console you.\u201d \u201cThat would be rather difficult to do!\u201d said Joe, with a contrite air. \u201cListen! I will take the exact bearings of this spot, and give them to you, so that, upon your return to England, you can tell our countrymen about it, and let them have a share, if you think that so much gold would make them happy.\u201d \u201cAh! master, I give up; I see that you are right, and that there is nothing else to be done. Let us fill our car with the precious mineral, and what remains at the end of the trip will be so much made.\u201d\n\nAnd Joe went to work. He did so, too, with all his might, and soon had collected more than a thousand pieces of quartz, which contained gold enclosed as though in an extremely hard crystal casket. The doctor watched him with a smile; and, while Joe went on, he took the bearings, and found that the missionary\u2019s grave lay in twenty-two degrees twenty-three minutes east longitude, and four degrees fifty-five minutes north latitude. Then, casting one glance at the swelling of the soil, beneath which the body of the poor Frenchman reposed, he went back to his car. He would have erected a plain, rude cross over the tomb, left solitary thus in the midst of the African deserts, but not a tree was to be seen in the environs. \u201cGod will recognize it!\u201d said Kennedy.",
    "It was not thirst alone, but the unchanging sight of the desert, that fatigued the mind. There was not a variation in the surface of the soil, not a hillock of sand, not a pebble, to relieve the gaze. This unbroken level discouraged the beholder, and gave him that kind of malady called the \u201cdesert-sickness.\u201d The impassible monotony of the arid blue sky, and the vast yellow expanse of the desert-sand, at length produced a sensation of terror. In this inflamed atmosphere the heat appeared to vibrate as it does above a blazing hearth, while the mind grew desperate in contemplating the limitless calm, and could see no reason why the thing should ever end, since immensity is a species of eternity.\n\nThus, at last, our hapless travellers, deprived of water in this torrid heat, began to feel symptoms of mental disorder. Their eyes swelled in their sockets, and their gaze became confused. When night came on, the doctor determined to combat this alarming tendency by rapid walking. His idea was to pace the sandy plain for a few hours, not in search of any thing, but simply for exercise. \u201cCome along!\u201d he said to his companions; \u201cbelieve me, it will do you good.\u201d \u201cOut of the question!\u201d said Kennedy; \u201cI could not walk a step.\u201d \u201cAnd I,\u201d said Joe, \u201cwould rather sleep!\u201d \u201cBut sleep, or even rest, would be dangerous to you, my friends; you must react against this tendency to stupor. Come with me!\u201d\n\nBut the doctor could do nothing with them, and, therefore, set off alone, amid the starry clearness of the night. The first few steps he took were painful, for they were the steps of an enfeebled man quite out of practice in walking. However, he quickly saw that the exercise would be beneficial to him, and pushed on several miles to the westward. Once in rapid motion, he felt his spirits greatly cheered, when, suddenly, a vertigo came over him; he seemed to be poised on the edge of an abyss; his knees bent under him; the vast solitude struck terror to his heart; he found himself the minute mathematical point, the centre of an infinite circumference, that is to say\u2014a nothing! The balloon had disappeared entirely in the deepening gloom. The doctor, cool, impassible, reckless explorer that he was, felt himself at last seized with a nameless dread. He strove to retrace his steps, but in vain. He called aloud. Not even an echo replied, and his voice died out in the empty vastness of surrounding space, like a pebble cast into a bottomless gulf; then, down he sank, fainting, on the sand, alone, amid the eternal silence of the desert.\n\nAt midnight he came to, in the arms of his faithful follower, Joe. The latter, uneasy at his master\u2019s prolonged absence, had set out after him, easily tracing him by the clear imprint of his feet in the sand, and had found him lying in a swoon. \u201cWhat has been the matter, sir?\u201d was the first inquiry. \u201cNothing, Joe, nothing! Only a touch of weakness, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s over now.\u201d \u201cOh! it won\u2019t amount to any thing, sir, I\u2019m sure of that; but get up on your feet, if you can. There! lean upon me, and let us get back to the balloon.\u201d\n\nAnd the doctor, leaning on Joe\u2019s arm, returned along the track by which he had come. \u201cYou were too bold, sir; it won\u2019t do to run such risks. You might have been robbed,\u201d he added, laughing. \u201cBut, sir, come now, let us talk seriously.\u201d \u201cSpeak! I am listening to you.\u201d \u201cWe must positively make up our minds to do something. Our present situation cannot last more than a few days longer, and if we get no wind, we are lost.\u201d The doctor made no reply. \u201cWell, then, one of us must sacrifice himself for the good of all, and it is most natural that it should fall to me to do so.\u201d \u201cWhat have you to propose? What is your plan?\u201d \u201cA very simple one! It is to take provisions enough, and to walk right on until I come to some place, as I must do, sooner or later. In the mean time, if Heaven sends you a good wind, you need not wait, but can start again. For my part, if I come to a village, I\u2019ll work my way through with a few Arabic words that you can write for me on a slip of paper, and I\u2019ll bring you help or lose my hide. What do you think of my plan?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is absolute folly, Joe, but worthy of your noble heart. The thing is impossible. You will not leave us.\u201d \u201cBut, sir, we must do something, and this plan can\u2019t do you any harm, for, I say again, you need not wait; and then, after all, I may succeed.\u201d \u201cNo, Joe, no! We will not separate. That would only be adding sorrow to trouble. It was written that matters should be as they are; and it is very probably written that it shall be quite otherwise by-and-by. Let us wait, then, with resignation.\u201d \u201cSo be it, master; but take notice of one thing: I give you a day longer, and I\u2019ll not wait after that. To-day is Sunday; we might say Monday, as it is one o\u2019clock in the morning, and if we don\u2019t get off by Tuesday, I\u2019ll run the risk. I\u2019ve made up my mind to that!\u201d The doctor made no answer, and in a few minutes they got back to the car, where he took his place beside Kennedy, who lay there plunged in silence so complete that it could not be considered sleep.\n\n\nDesperate, mad, he snatched at the weapon, and turned the barrel toward his mouth. \u201cKennedy!\u201d shouted Joe, throwing himself upon his friend. \u201cLet go! hands off!\u201d moaned the Scot, in a hoarse, grating voice\u2014and then the two struggled desperately for the rifle. \u201cLet go, or I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d repeated Kennedy. But Joe clung to him only the more fiercely, and they had been contending thus without the doctor seeing them for many seconds, when, suddenly the rifle went off. At the sound of its discharge, the doctor rose up erect, like a spectre, and glared around him. But all at once his glance grew more animated; he extended his hand toward the horizon, and in a voice no longer human shrieked: \u201cThere! there\u2014off there!\u201d"

    "Meldrum Strange has \"a way\" with him. You need all your tact to get him past the quarreling point; but once that point is left behind there isn't a finer business boss in the universe.

That's all.\"\n\nMy passport being unexpired, I could make the _Mauretania_ and did. Moreover I was merciless to the expense account. An aeroplane took me from Liverpool to London, another from London to Paris.\n\nI don't care how often you arrive in Bombay, the thrill increases. You steam in at dawn by Gharipuri just as the gun announces sunrise, and the dreamy bay glimmers like a prophet's vision--temples, domes, minarets, palm-trees, roofs, towers, and masts.\n\nAlmost before the anchor had splashed into the spawn-skeined water off the Apollo Bunder a native boat drew alongside and a very well-dressed native climbed up the companion-ladder in quest of me. I had sent King a wireless, but his messenger was away in advance of even the bankers' agents, who flock on board to tout for customs business.\n\nHe handed me a letter which simply said that the bearer, Gulab Lal Singh, would look after me and my belongings. So I paid attention to the man. He was a strapping fellow, handsome as the deuce, with a Roman nose, and the eye of a gentleman unafraid.\n\nHe said that Major King was in Bombay, but detained by urgent business. However, he invited me to Major King's quarters for breakfast, so instead of waiting for the regular launch I got into the native sailboat with him. And he seemed to have some sort of talisman for charming officials, for on the quay an officer motioned us through without even examining my passport.\n\nWe drew up finally in front of a neat little bungalow in a long street of similar buildings intended for British officials. Gulab Lal Singh took me straight into the dining room and carried in breakfast with his own hands, standing behind my chair in silence while I ate.\n\nWithout much effort I could see his face in the mirror to my right, and when I thought he wasn't noticing I studied him carefully.\n\n\"Is there anything further that the _sahib_ would care for?\" he asked when the meal was finished.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, pulling out an envelope. \"Here's your contract, Major King. If you're agreeable we may as well get that signed and mailed to New York.\"\n\nI expected to see him look surprised, but he simply sat down at the table, read the contract over, and signed it.\n\nThen we went out on to a veranda that was shut off from the street by brown _kaskas tatties_.\n\n\"How long does it take you to grow a beard?\" was his first, rather surprising question.",
    "At last, at the end of a wide hall before many-hued silken curtains our two guides stopped. As they released our hands, with the always surprising strength that is part of the dancing woman's stock-in-trade, they slipped behind us suddenly and thrust us forward through the curtains.\n\nThere was not much to see in front of us. We found ourselves in a paneled corridor, whose narrow windows overlooked the river, facing a painted door sixty paces distant at the farther end. King strode down the corridor and knocked.\n\nThe answer was one word that I did not catch, although it rang like a suddenly struck chord of music, and the door yielded to the pressure of King's hand.\n\nI entered behind him and the door swung shut of its own weight with a click. We were in a high-ceilinged, very long room, having seven sides. There were windows to right and left. A deep divan piled with scented cushions occupied the whole length of one long wall, and there were several huge cushions on the floor against another wall. There was one other door besides that we had entered by.\n\nWe stood in that room alone, but I know that King felt as uneasy as I did, for there was sweat on the back of his neck. We were being watched by unseen eyes. There is no mistaking that sensation.\n\nSuddenly a voice broke silence like a golden bell whose overtones go widening in rings into infinity, and a vision of loveliness parted the curtains of that other door.\n\n\"My lord comes as is meet--spurred, and ready to give new kingdoms to his king! Oh, how my lord is welcome!\" she said in Persian.\n\nHer voice thrilled you, because of its perfect resonance, exactly in the middle of the note. She looked into King's eyes with challenging familiarity that made him smile, and then eyed me wonderingly. She glanced from me to a picture on the wall in blue of the Elephant-god--enormous, opulent, urbane, and then back again at me, and smiled very sweetly.\n\n\"So you have brought Ganesha with you? The god of good luck! How wonderful! How does one behave toward a real god?\"\n\nAnd while she said that she laid her hands on King's arms as naturally as if he were a lover whom she had not seen perhaps since yesterday. Plainly, there was absolutely nothing between him and her except his own obstinate independence. She was his if he wanted her.\n\nShe took King's hand with a laugh that had its roots in past companionship and led him to the middle, deepest window-seat, beneath which the river could be heard gurgling busily.\n\nThen, when she had drawn the silken hangings until the softened light suggested lingering, uncounted hours, and had indicated with a nod to me a cushion in the corner, she came and lay on the cushions close to King, chin on hand, where she could watch his eyes.\n\nKing sat straight and square, watching her with caution that he did not trouble to conceal. She took his hand and raised the sleeve until the broad, gold, graven bracelet showed.\n\n\"That link forged in the past must bind us two more surely than an oath,\" she said smiling.\n\n\"I used it to show to the gatekeeper.\"\n\nHe sat cooly waiting for her next remark. And with almost unnecessary candor began to remove the bracelet and offer it back to her. So she unmasked her batteries, with a delicious little rippling laugh and a lazy, cat-like movement that betokened joy in the danger that was coming, if I know anything at all of what sign-language means.\n\n\"I knew that very day that you resigned your commission in the army, and I laughed with delight at the news, knowing that the gods who are our servants had contrived it. I know why thou art here,\" she said; and the change from you to thou was not haphazard.\n\n\"It is well known, Princess, that your spies are the cleverest in India,\" King answered.\n\n\"Spies? I need no spies as long as old India lives. Friends are better.\"\n\n\"Do all princesses break their promises?\" he countered, meeting her eyes steadily.\n\n\"Never yet did I break one promise, whether it was for good or evil.\"\n\n\"Princess,\" he answered, looking sternly at her, \"in Jamrud Fort you agreed to take no part again in politics, national or international in return for a promise of personal freedom and permission to reside in India.\"\n\n\"My promise was dependent on my liberty. But is this liberty--to be forced to reside in this old palace, with the spies of the Government keeping watch on my doings, except when they chance to be outwitted? Nevertheless, I have kept my promise. Thou knowest me better than to think that I need to break promises in order to outwit a government of Englishmen!\"\n\n\"Quibbles won't help, Princess,\" he answered. \"You promised to do nothing that Government might object to.\"\n\n\"Well; will they object to my religion?\" she retorted, mocking him. \"Has the British _raj_ at last screwed up its courage to the point of trespassing behind the purdah and blundering in among religious exercises?\"\n\nNo man in his senses ever challenges a woman's argument until he knows the whole of it and has unmasked its ulterior purpose. So King sat still and said nothing, knowing that that was precisely what she did not want.\n\n\"You must make terms with me, heaven-born!\" she went on, changing her tone to one of rather more suggestive firmness. \"The _Kali-Yug_ (age of darkness) is drawing to a close, and India awakes! There is froth on the surface--a rising here, an agitation there, a deal of wild talk everywhere, and the dead old government proposes to suppress it in the dead old ways, like men with paddles seeking to beat the waves down flat! But the winds of God blow, and the boat of the men with the paddles will be upset presently. Who then shall ride the storm? Their gunners will be told to shoot the froth as it forms and rises! But if there is a wise man anywhere he will make terms with me, and will set himself to guide the underlying forces that may otherwise whelm everything. I think thou art wise, my heaven-born. Thou wert wise once on a time.\"\n\n\"Do you think you can rule India?\" King asked her; and he did not make the mistake of suggesting ridicule.\n\n\"Who else can do it?\" she retorted. \"Do you think we come into the world to let fate be our master? Why have I royal blood and royal views, wealth, understanding and ambition, while the others have blindness and vague yearnings? Can you answer?\"",
    "The Gray Mahatma led the way through the door by which we had entered, stalking along in his saffron robe without the slightest effort to seem dignified or solemn.\n\n\"Keep your wits about you,\" King whispered; and then again, presently: \"Don't be fooled into thinking that anything you see is supernatural. Remember that whatever you see is simply the result of something that they know and that we don't. Keep your hair on! We're going to see some wonderful stuff or I'm a Dutchman.\"\n\nWe passed down the long corridor outside Yasmini's room, but instead of continuing straight forward, the Gray Mahatma found an opening behind a curtain in a wall whose thickness could be only guessed. Inside the wall was a stairway six feet wide that descended to an echoing, unfurnished hall below after making two turns inside solid masonry.\n\nThe lower hall was dark, but he found his way without difficulty, picking up a lantern from a corner on his way and then opening a door that gave, underneath the outer marble stairway, on to the court where the pool and the flowering shrubs were. The lantern was not lighted when he picked it up. I did not see how he lighted it. It was an ordinary oil lantern, apparently, with a wire handle to carry it by, and after he had carried it for half a minute it seemed to burn brightly of its own accord. I called King's attention to it.\n\n\"I've seen that done before,\" he answered, but he did not say whether or not he understood the trick of it.\n\nIsmail came running to meet us the instant we showed ourselves, but stopped when he saw the Mahatma and, kneeling, laid the palms of both hands on his forehead on the stone flags. That was a strange thing for a Moslem to do--especially toward a Hindu--but the Mahatma took not the slightest notice of him and walked straight past as if he had not been there. He could hear King's footsteps and mine behind him, of course, and did not need to look back, but there was something almost comical in the way he seemed to ignore our existence and go striding along alone as if on business bent. He acted as little like a priest or a fakir or a fanatic as any man I have ever seen, and no picture-gallery curator or theater usher ever did the honors of the show with less attention to his own importance.\n\nHe led the way through the same bronze gate that we had entered by and never paused or glanced behind him until he came to the cage where the old black panther snarled behind the bars; and then a remarkable thing happened.\n\nAt first the panther began running backward and forward, as the caged brutes usually do when they think they are going to be fed; for all his age he looked as full of fight as a newly caught young one, and his long yellow fangs flashed from under the curled lip--until the Mahatma spoke to him. He only said one word that I could hear, and I could not catch what the word was; but instantly the black brute slunk away to the corner of its cage farthest from the iron door, and at that the Mahatma opened the door without using any key that I detected. The padlock may have been a trick one, but I know this;--it came away in his hands the moment he touched it.\n\nThen at last he took notice of King and me again. He stood aside, and smiled, and motioned to us with his hand to enter the cage ahead of him. I have been several sorts of rash idiot in my time, and I daresay that King has too, for most of us have been young once; but I have also hunted panthers, and so has King, and to walk unarmed or even with weapons--into a black panther's cage is something that calls, I should say, for inexperience. The more you know about panthers the less likely you are to do it. It was almost pitch-dark; you could see the brute's yellow eyes gleaming, but no other part of him now, because he matched the shadows perfectly; but, being a cat, he could see us, and the odds against a man who should walk into that cage were, as a rough guess, ten trillion to one.\n\n\"Fear is the presence of death, and death is delusion. Follow me then,\" said the Mahatma.\n\nHe walked straight in, keeping the lighted lantern on the side of him farthest from the panther, whose claws I could hear scratching on the stone flags.\n\n\"Keep that light toward him for God's sake!\" I urged, having myself had to use a lantern more than a score of times for protection at night against the big cats.\n\n\"Nay, it troubles his eyes. For God's sake I will hide it from him,\" the Mahatma answered. \"We must not wait here.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" said King, and strode in through the open door. So I went in too, because I did not care to let King see me hesitate. Curiosity had vanished. I was simply in a blue funk, and rather angry as well at the absurdity of what we were doing.\n\nThe Gray Mahatma turned and shut the gate behind me, taking no notice at all of the black brute that crouched in the other corner, grumbling and moaning rather than growling.\n\nHave you ever seen a panther spit and spring when a keeper shoved it out of the way with the cleaning rake? There is no beast in the world with whom it is more dangerous to play tricks. Yet in that dark corner, with the lantern held purposely so that it should not dazzle the panther's eyes, the Gray Mahatma stirred the beast with his toe and drove him away as carelessly and incautiously as you might shove your favorite dog aside! The panther crowded itself against the side of the cage and slunk away behind us--to the front of the cage that is to say, close by the padlocked gate--where he crouched again and moaned.\n\nThe dark, rear end of the cage was all masonry and formed part of the building behind it. In the right-hand corner, almost invisible from outside, was a narrow door of thick teak that opened very readily when the Mahatma fumbled with it although I saw no lock, hasp or keyhole on the side toward us. We followed him through into a stone vault.\n\n\"And now there is need to be careful,\" he said, his voice booming and echoing along unseen corridors. \"For though those here, who can harm you if they will, are without evil intention, nevertheless injury begets desire to injure. And do either of you know how to make acceptable explanations to a she-cobra whose young have been trodden on? Therefore walk with care, observing the lantern light and remembering that as long as you injure none, none will injure you.\"\n\nAt that he turned on his heel abruptly and walked forward, swinging the lantern so that its light swept to and fro. We were walking through the heart of masonry whose blocks were nearly black with age; there was a smell of ancient sepulchers, and in places the walls were damp enough to be green and slippery. Presently we came to the top of a flight of stone steps, each step being made of one enormous block and worn smooth by the sandalled traffic of centuries. It grew damper as we descended, and those great blocks were tricky things for a man in boots to walk on; yet the Gray Mahatma, swinging his lantern several steps below us, kept calling back:\n\n\"Have a care! Have a care! He who falls can do as much injury as he who jumps! Shall the injured inquire into reasons?\"",
    "He stepped down into the water, and at once it became evident that to all intents and purposes there were two tanks, the division between them lying about eighteen inches under water. But the division was neither straight nor exactly level. It zig-zagged this and that way like the key-track in a maze, and was more beset with slippery pitfalls than a mussel-shoal at low tide.\n\nKing followed the Mahatma in, and I came last, so I had the benefit of two pilots, as well as the important task of holding King whenever he groped his way forward with one foot. For the Mahatma went a great deal faster than we cared to follow, so that although he had shown us the way we were still doubtful of our footing. At intervals he would pause and turn and look at us, and every time he did that those long loathsome snouts would ripple toward him like spokes of a wheel, but he took no more notice of them than if they had been water-rats. They seemed more interested in him than in us.\n\nThere were seven sharp turns in that underwater causeway, and the edges of each turn were slippery slopes, up which an alligator certainly could climb, but that afforded not the least chance to a man whose foot once stepped too far and slid. And not only were there unexpected turns at different intervals, but there were gaps in the causeway of a yard or so in at least a dozen places, and the edges of those gaps were smooth and rounded, as if purposely designed to dump all wayfarers into the very jaws of the waiting reptiles. It was in just such places as that that they began to gather and wait patiently, with their awful yellow eyes just noticeable in the starlight.\n\nKing and I were standing on one such rounded guessing-place.\n\nThe Mahatma, twenty yards away, was taking his time about turning to give us directions, and one great fifteen foot brute had raised itself on the causeway behind us and was snapping its paws together like a pair of vicious castanets.\n\n\"Nero and Caligula were Christian gentlemen compared to you!\" I called out to the Mahatma.\n\n\"You are fortunate,\" he boomed back. \"You have starlight and a guide. Those who are not chosen have to find their way--or fail--alone under a cloudy sky. There is none to hold _them_ while they grope; there is none to care whether they succeed or not, save only the _mugger_ that desires a meal. Nevertheless, there are some of them who succeed, so how should you fail? Take a step to the left now--a long one, each holding the other, then another to the left--then to the right again.\"\n\n\"Curse you!\" I shouted back, staring over King's shoulder. \"There's a _mugger's_ head between us and the next stepping-stone!\"\n\n\"Nay!\" he answered. \"That _is_ the stepping-stone.\"\n\nI could have sworn that he was lying, but King set his foot on it and in a moment more we were working our way cautiously along the causeway again, making for the next sharp corner where the Mahatma had been standing to give us the direction. But he never waited for us to catch up with him. I think he suspected that in panic we might clutch him and offer violence, and he always moved on as we approached, leaving us to grope our way in agonies of apprehension.\n\nThe going did not become easier as we progressed. When the Gray Mahatma reached the steps on the far side and stood, out of the water waiting for us, all the monsters that had watched his progress came and joined our party; and now, instead of keeping to the water, two of them climbed up on the causeway, so that there was one of the creatures behind us and two in front.\n\n\"Call off your cousins and your uncles and your aunts!\" I shouted, bearing in mind the Hindu creed that consigns the souls of unrighteous men to the bodies of animals in retribution for their sins.\n\nThe Gray Mahatma picked up a short pole from the embankment, and returned into the water with it, not striking out right and left as any ordinary-minded person would have done, but shoving the brutes away gently one by one, as if they were logs or small boats. And even so, they followed us so closely that they climbed the steps abreast of us.\n\nBut I'm willing to bet that there is not an alligator living that can catch me once my feet are set on hard ground, and I can say the same for King; we danced up those steps together like a pair of fauns emerging from a forest pool.\n\nThen the Gray Mahatma came and peered into our faces, and asked an extraordinary question.\n\n\"Do you feel proud?\" he asked, looking keenly from one to the other of us. \"Because,\" he went on to explain, \"you have now crossed the Pool of Terrors, and they are not so many who accomplish that. The _muggers_ are well fed. And those who reach to this side are usually proud, believing they now have the secret key to the attainment of all Knowledge. You are going to see now what becomes of the proud ones.\"\n\nThe Mahatma led us forward toward a long, dark shadow that transformed itself into a temple wall as we drew closer, and in a moment we were once more groping our way downward amid prehistoric foundation stones, with bats flitting past us and a horrible feeling possessing me, at least, that the worst was yet to come.",
    "\"All energy is vibrations; yet that is only one fraction of the truth. All is vibration. The universe consists of nothing else. Your Western scientists are just beginning to discover that, but they are men groping in the dark, who can feel but not see and understand. Throughout what all nations have agreed to call the dark ages there have been men called alchemists, whom other men have mocked because they sought to transmute baser metals into gold. Do you think they sought what was impossible? Nothing is impossible! They dimly discerned the possibility. And it may be that their ears had caught the legend of what has been known in India for countless ages.\n\nGold is a system of vibrations, just as every other metal is, and the one can be changed into the other. But if you knew how to do it, would you dare? Can you conceive what would happen to the world if it were common knowledge, or even if it were known to a few, how the transmutation may be brought about? Now watch!\"\n\nWhat followed was convincing for the simple reason that there was nothing covered up, and no complicated apparatus that might cause you to suspect an ordinary conjuring trick. There were certainly strange looking boxes with hinged lids arranged on a ledge along one side of the chamber, but those were only brought into play when the funny little ex-fat man selected a lump of metal from them. On another ledge on the opposite side of the cell there were about a hundred rolls of very ancient-looking manuscripts, but he did not make use of them in any way.\n\nThe floor was bare, smooth rock; there was nothing on it, not even a mat. He laid a plain piece of wood on the floor and motioned us to be seated in front of it; so we squatted in a line with our backs to the door, King taking his place between the Mahatma and me. There was no hocus-pocus or flummery; the whole proceeding was as simple as playing dominoes.\n\nOur host went to one of the peculiar looking boxes and selected a lump of what looked like lead. It was a small piece, about the size of an ordinary loaf of sugar and had no particular marks on it, except that it looked as if it might have been cut from a larger piece with shears or some such instrument. He dropped in into the middle of the slab of wood, and squatted in front of it, facing us, to watch.\n\nI daresay it took twenty minutes for that lump of lead to change into what looked like gold before our eyes. It began by sizzling, and melting in little pits and spots, but never once did the whole lump melt.\n\nThe tiny portions that melted and liquefied became full of motion, although the motion was never in one place for more than about a minute at a time; and wherever the motion had been the lump lost bulk, so that gradually the whole piece shrank and shrank. At the end it was not in its original shape, but had taken the form of a miniature cow's dropping.\n\nI suppose it was hot. Our host waited several minutes before picking it off the slab.\n\nAt last he took the nugget off the slab and tossed it to King. King handed it to me. It was still warm and it looked and felt like gold. I laid it back on the slab.\n\n\"Do you understand it?\" asked the Gray Mahatma.",
    "We came to a door on our right. It was opened instantly by a lean, mean-looking ascetic, whose hooked nose suggested an infernal brand of contempt for whoever might not agree with him. Just as the others had done, he met the Gray Mahatma's eyes in silence, and admitted us by simply turning his back. But this door only opened into another passage, and we had to follow him for fifty feet and then through another door into a cavern that was bigger than any. And this time our host was not alone. We were expected by a dozen lean, bronze men, who squatted in a row on one mat with expressionless faces. They were not wearing masks, but they looked as if they might have been.\n\nThis last cavern was certainly a blow-hole. Its round roof, blackened with smoke, was like the underside of a cathedral dome. No effort seemed to have been made to trim the walls, and the floor, too, had been left as nature made it, shaped something like a hollow dish by the pressure of expanding gases millions of years ago when the rock was molten.\n\nThe very center of the vast floor was the lowest point of all, and some work had been done there, for it was shaped into a rectangular trough thirty feet long by ten wide. That trough--there was no guessing how deep it might be--was filled almost to the brim with white-hot charcoal, so that obviously there was a means of forcing a draft into it from underneath.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Mahatma, turning to King as usual and ignoring me, \"your friend may submit to the test if he wishes. He may walk on that furnace. He shall walk unscathed. I promise it.\"\n\nKing turned to me.\n\n\"What d'you say?\" he asked. \"I've seen this done before.[2] It can be done. Shall we try it together?\"\n\nI did not hesitate. There are times when even such a slow thinker as I am can make up his mind in a flash. I said \"No\" with such emphasis that King laughed. The Mahatma looked at me rather pityingly, but made no comment. He invited the two of us to sit down, so we squatted on the floor as close to the trough as we could go without being scorched. There were no screens or obstructions of any kind, and the only appliance in evidence was an iron paddle, which the man who had admitted us picked up off the floor.\n\nHe took that paddle, and without any preliminary fuss or hesitation walked straight on to the bed of white-hot charcoal, beginning at one end, and smoothed the whole glowing surface with the paddle, taking his time about it and working with as little excitement as a gardener using a rake. When he had finished the end of the paddle was better than red-hot--a good cherry-red.\n\nThe hairs on his legs were unscorched. The cotton cloth of which his kilt was made showed not the slightest trace of burning.\n\nAs soon as he had sat down the other twelve advanced toward the fire. Unlike him, they were stark naked. One by one they walked into the fire and traversed it from end to end with no more sign of nervousness than if they had been utterly unconscious of its existence. Then they turned around and walked back again.\n\n\"Is it the men or the fire?\" King demanded.\n\n\"Neither,\" the Mahatma answered. \"It is simply knowledge. Any one can do it, who knows how.\"\n\nOne of the men approached the fire again. He sat down on it, and went through the motions of bathing himself in the white-hot flame, turning his head repeatedly to grin at us. Then, lying down full-length, he rolled from end to end of the furnace, and walked away at last as casually as if he had come out of a bath. It was perfectly astonishing stuff to watch.\n\n\"If this isn't superstition, or mesmerism, or deception of some kind, why do you insist on all this mummery of soot and ashes for my friend and me?\" King demanded. \"Why do you use a temple full of Hindu idols to conceal your science, if it is a natural science and not trickery?\"\n\nThe Gray Mahatma smiled tolerantly.\n\n\"Can you suggest a better way of keeping the secret?\" he answered. \"We are protected by the superstition. Not even the Government of India would dare arouse the superstitious wrath of a people by inquiring too closely into what goes on beneath a temple. If we were to admit that what we know is science, just as wireless telegraphy is a science, we would not be safe for an hour; the military, the kings of commerce, the merely curious, and all the enemies of mankind would invent ten thousand excuses of investigating us.\"",
    "\"Hold my hand,\" I said, \"and jump your limit outward!\"\n\nThe Gray Mahatma opened one eye and divined our intention. \"Mad!\" he exclaimed. \"So then that is the end of them!\" He believed what he said, for he sat still. But Yasmini came running, screaming to her women to prevent us. King and I took off together, hand-in-hand, and I take my Bible oath that I looked up, and saw Yasmini and the Gray Mahatma leaning out of the window to watch us drown! Of course, seventy feet is nothing much--provided you are used to the take-off, and know the water, and have a boat waiting handy to pick you up. But we had none of these advantages, and in addition to that we had the grievous handicap that King could not swim a stroke.\n\nWe took the water feet-first, close together, and that very instant I knew what we were up against. As we plunged under, we were whirled against a sunken pole that whipped and swayed in the current. King was wrenched away from me. When I fought my way to the surface I was already a hundred yards beyond the palace wall, and there was no sign of King, although I could see his turban pursuing mine down-stream. We were caught in the strongest current I had ever striven with.\n\nI don't know what persuaded me to turn and try to swim against it for a moment. Instinct, I suppose. It was utterly impossible; I was swept along backward almost as fast as I had been traveling before. But what the effort did do was to bring me face-up-stream, and so I caught sight of King clinging to a pole and being bobbed under every time the weight of water caused the pole to duck. I managed to cling to a pole myself, although like King it ducked me repeatedly, and it was perfectly evident that neither of us would be alive in the next ten minutes unless a boat should come or I should produce enough brawn and brain for two of us. And there was no boat in sight.\n\nSo between ducks I yelled to King to let go and drift down toward me. He did it; and that, I believe, is the utmost test of cold courage to which I have ever seen any man subjected; for even a strong swimmer becomes panic-stricken when he learns he is no longer master of his element. King had the self-control and pluck to lie still and drift down on me like a corpse, and I let go the pole in the nick of time to seize him as his head went under.\n\nFollowed a battle royal. Fight how I might, I could not keep both of our heads out of the water more than half the time, and King very soon lost the little breath that was left in him. Thereafter, he struggled a bit, but that did not last long, and presently he became unconscious. I believed he was dead.\n\nThe choice then seemed to lie between drowning too or letting go of him. I did not dare try the shallows, for ninety per cent. of them are quicksands in that river, and more than one army has perished in the effort to force its way across. The only possible safety lay in keeping to mid-stream and sweeping along with the current until something should turn up--a boat--a log--possibly a backwater, or even the breakwater of a bridge.\n\nSo I decided to drown, and to annoy the angels of the underworld by taking as long as possible in the process. And I set to work to fight as I had never in my whole life fought before. It was like swimming in a millrace. The current swirled us this and that way, but everlastingly forward.\n\nSometimes the current rolled us over and over on each other, but for fifty per cent. of the time I managed to keep King on top of me, I swimming on my back and holding him by both arms, head nearly out of the water. I can't explain exactly why I went to all that trouble, for I was convinced he was dead.\n\nI remember wondering what the next world was going to be like, and whether King and I would meet there, or whether we would each be sent to a sphere suited to our individual requirements--and if so, what my sphere would be like, and whether either of us would ever meet Yasmini, and what she would be doing there. But it never occurred to me once that Athelstan King might be alive yet, or that he and I would be presently treading mother earth again.\n\nI remember several terrific minutes when a big tree came whirling toward us in an eddy, and my legs got tangled up in some part of it that was under water. Then, when I managed to struggle free, King's cotton loin-cloth became wrapped in a tangle of twigs and I could neither wrench nor break him free; whenever I tried it I merely sent myself under and pulled his head after me.\n\nHowever, that tree suggested the possibility of prolonging the agony a while. I seized a branch and tried to take advantage of it, using all my strength and skill to keep the tree from rolling over on King and submerging him completely. I can remember when we whirled under the steel bridge and the tree struck the breakwater of the middle pier; that checked us for a moment, and instead of sending us under, dragged King half out of the water, so that he lay after that on top of a branch.\n\nThen the stream got us going again, and swung the butt end of the tree around so that I was forced by it backward through the arch of the bridge; and after that for more than a mile we were waltzed round and round past sand-banks where the alligators lay on the look-out for half-burned corpses from the burning ghats higher up. At last we swung round a curve in the river and came on a quiet bay where they were washing elephants. The current swung the tree inshore to a point where it struck a submerged sand-bank and stuck there; and there we lay with the current racing by, and King bobbing up and down with his head out of water, and I too weak by that time to break off the twig around which his loin-cloth was wrapped.\n\nWell, there we were; but after a few minutes I raised enough steam for the whistle at all events. I yelled until my own ear-drums seemed to be bursting and my lungs ached from the pressure on the water in them, and after what seemed an eternity one of the mahouts on shore heard me. Hope surged triumphant! I could see him wave his arm, and already I saw visions of dry land again, and a disappointed Yama! But I was overlooking one important point: we were in India, where rescues are not undertaken in a hurry.\n\nHe called a conference. I saw all the mahouts gather together in one place and stare at us and talk. They swung their arms as they argued. I don't know what argument it was that finally appealed to the mahouts, but after an interminable session one of them fetched a long rope and nine or ten of them climbed on the backs of three big elephants. They worked their way a little bit upstream, and then came as close as the elephants dared. One of the big brutes felt his way cautiously to within twenty yards, and then threw up his trunk and refused to budge another inch.\n\nAt that a lean, naked, black man stood up on his rump and paid out the rope down-stream. He had to make nine or ten attempts before it finally floated within reach of my hand. Then I made it fast to the tree and, taking King in my right arm, started to work my way along it. It was just as well I did that, and got clear of the branch; for the mahouts passed the rope around the elephant's neck and set him to hauling; he rolled the tree over and over, and that would surely have been the end of King and me if we had been within reach of the overturning branches. As it was I clung to the rope and the elephant hauled the lot of us high and dry.",
    "As he did that, a man who was something of an athlete swung himself up on the off-side footboard, and a second later the proud face of the Gray Mahatma confronted me across the saddle-pad alongside King's! \"You are heavy enough to balance the two of us,\" he said, as if no other comment were necessary. \"Why did you run away from me? You can never escape!\"\n\nWell, of course anybody could say that after he had found us again. \"Was it you who checked this elephant?\" I asked him, remembering what he had done to the black panther and the snakes, but he did not answer. \"Where do you think you are going?\" I asked.\n\n\"That is what the dry leaves asked of the wind,\" he answered. \"An observant eye is better than a yearning ear, and patience outwears curiosity!\"\n\nSuddenly I recalled a remark that King had made on the beach and it dawned on me that by frightening the mahout into silence the Mahatma might undo the one gain we had made by that plunge and swim. As long as the Maharajah who owned the elephant was to hear about our adventure, all was well. News of us would reach the Government. Most of the maharajahs are pro-British, because their very existence as reigning princes depends on that attitude, and they can be relied on to report to the British authorities any irregularity whatever that comes under their notice and at the same time does not incriminate themselves.\n\nThe same thought probably occurred to King, but he was rather too recently recovered from drowning to be quick yet off the mark and besides, the Mahatma was between him and the mahout, whereas I had a free field. So I tugged at the arm of the second mahout, who was sitting behind his chief, and he scrambled down beside me.\n\nThe Mahatma tried to take immediate advantage of that, and the very thing he did made it all the easier for me to deal with the second mahout, who had made the trip with us and who stared into my face with a kind of puzzled mistrust. The Mahatma, as active as a cat, climbed up behind the chief mahout and sat astride the elephant's neck in the place where the second mahout had been, and began whispering.\n\n\"What is your Maharajah's name?\" I asked my neighbor on the plank.\n\n\"Jihanbihar,\" he answered, giving a string of titles too that had no particular bearing on the situation. They sounded like a page of the Old Testament.\n\n\"You observe that his favorite elephant is about to be stolen with the aid of the Gray Mahatma!\"\n\nThe fellow nodded, and the expression of his face was not exactly pleased; he may have been one of a crowd that got cursed by the Mahatma for asking too many impertinent questions.\n\n\"He has a reputation, that Mahatma, hasn't he?\" I suggested. \"You have heard of the miracles that he performs?\"\n\nHe nodded again.\n\n\"You see that he is talking to the chief mahout now? Take my word for it, he is casting a spell on him! Would you like to have him cast a spell on you too?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Run swiftly then, and tell the Maharajah _sahib_ to get a Brahman to cancel the spell, and you will be rewarded. Go quickly.\"\n\nHe dropped from the plank and went off at a run just as the Mahatma turned and saw him. The Mahatma had been whispering in the mahout's ear, and as his eye met mine I laughed. For a moment he watched the man running, and then, as if to demonstrate what a strange mixture of a man he was, he laughed back at me. He acknowledged defeat instantly, and did not appear in the least annoyed by it, but on the contrary appeared to accord me credit for outwitting him, as undoubtedly I had.\n\nIndia is not a democratic country. Nobody is troubled about keeping the underworld in its place, so mahout or sweeper has the ear of majesty as readily as any other man, if not even more so. And it would not make the slightest difference now what kind of cock and bull story the mahout might tell to the Maharajah. However wild it might be it would certainly include the fact that two white men had ridden to Yasmini's palace on the Maharajah's favorite elephant after having been fished out of the river by mahouts at the elephant's bathing ghat.\n\nIt was the likeliest thing in the world that representations would be made that very afternoon by telegraph to the nearest important British official, who would feel compelled to make inquiries. The British Government can not afford to have even unknown white men mysteriously made away with.\n\nThe Gray Mahatma took all that for granted and nodded comprehendingly. His smile, as we neared Yasmini's palace gate, appeared to me to include a perfect appreciation of the situation. He seemed to accept it as candidly as he had acknowledged my frequent escapes the night before.  Ismail opened the gate without demur and Akbar sauntered in, being used to palaces. He passed under the first arch into the second courtyard, coming to a halt at a gate on the far side that was too small for his enormous bulk where he proceeded to kneel without waiting for instructions.\n\n\"Do you feel proud?\" the Mahatma asked me unexpectedly as he climbed off Akbar's neck.  Suspecting some sort of verbal trap I did not answer him. \"You are like this elephant. You are able to do irreparable damage if you see fit. _She_ was as apt as usual when she dubbed you Ganesha!\"",
    "\"Tell me just what transpired between you and King from the time when you disappeared out there in the courtyard until you came in here alone!\"\n\n\"No beating in the world could make me say a word,\" he answered calmly. \"You would only feel horribly ashamed.\"\n\nI believed him, and sat still, he looking at me in a sort of way in which a connoisseur studies a picture with his eyelids a little lowered.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" he went on presently, \"I observe that I have misjudged you in some respects. You are a man of violent temper, which is cave-man foolishness; yet you have prevailing judgment, which is the beginning of civilization. There is no reason why I should not tell you what you desire to know, even though it will do you no good.\"\n\n\"I listen,\" I answered, trying to achieve that air of humility with which _chelas_ listen to their _gurus_. That was partly because I really respected the man in a way; and partly because there was small harm in flattering him a little, if that could induce him to tell me the more.\n\n\"Know then,\" he began, \"that it was my fault that the Princess Yasmini was able to play that trick on us. It was to me that she first made the proposal that we should use her audience hall for our conference. It was I who conveyed that proposal to those whom it concerned, and I who persuaded them. It was through my lack of diligence that the hiding-place was overlooked in which she and certain of her women lay concealed, so that they overheard some of our secrets. For that I should have been condemned to death at once, and it would have been better if that had been done. Yet for fifty years I have been a man of honor. And although it is one of our chief requirements that we lay aside such foolishness as sentiment, nevertheless the seeds of sentiment remained, and those men were loath to enforce the penalty on me, who had taught so many of them. So they compromised, which is inevitably fatal. For compromise bears within itself the roots of right and wrong, so that whatever good may come of it must nevertheless be ruined by inherent evil. I bade them use me for their studies, and have done with compromise, but being at fault my authority was gone, so they had their way. They imposed on me the task of making use of the Princess Yasmini, and of employing her by some means to make a beginning of the liberation of India. And she sought to make use of me to get Athelstan King into her clutches. Moreover, believing that her influence over us was now too great to be resisted, she demanded that Athelstan King and yourself should be shown sciences; and I consented, believing that thereby your friend might be convinced, and would agree to go to the United States to shape public opinion. Thereafter you know what happened. You know also that, because the seeds of compromise were inherent in the plan, my purpose failed. Instead of consenting to go to the United States Athelstan King insisted on learning our sciences. You and he escaped, by a dive from the upper window of this palace that would not have disgraced two fish-hawks, and although you never guessed it, by that dive you sentenced me to death. For I had to report your escape to those whom it most concerned. And at once it was obvious to them that you were certain to tell what you had seen. Nevertheless, there was one chance remaining that you might both be drowned; and one chance that you might be recaptured before you could tell any one what you had seen. And there was a third chance that, if you should be recaptured, you might be persuaded to promise never to reveal what little of our secrets you already know. In that case, your lives might be spared, although not mine. So it was laid upon me to discover where you were, and to bring you back if possible. And on the polished table in that cave in which you saw Benares and Bombay and London and New York, I watched you swim down the river until you were rescued by the elephants. So then I went to meet you and bring you back.\"\n\n\"What if we had refused?\"\n\n\"That elephant you rode--hah! One word from me, and the mob would have blamed you for the damage. They would have pulled you from the elephant and beaten you to death. Such processes are very simple to any one who understands mob-passions. Just a word--just a hint--and the rest is inevitable.\"\n\n\"But you say you are under sentence of death. What if you should refuse to obey them?\"\n\n\"Why refuse? What good would that do?\"\n\n\"But you were at liberty. Why not run away?\"\n\n\"Whither? Besides, should I, who have enforced the penalty of death on so many fools, disloyal ones and fanatics, reject it for myself when I myself have failed? There is nothing unpleasant about death, my friend, although the manner of it may be terrible. But even torture is soon over; and the sting is gone from torture when the victim knows that the cause of science is thereby being advanced. They will learn from my agonies.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself!\" I urged him. \"Each to his own amusement. What happened after I turned to watch the elephant at the gate?\"\n\n\"Those on whom the keeping of our secret rests considered that none would believe you, even if you were to tell what you have seen. But Athelstan King is different. For many years the Indian Government has accepted his bare word. Moreover, we knew that we can also accept his word. He is a man whose promises are as good as money, as the saying is. So after you turned aside to watch an elephant, those who were watching us opened a hidden door and Athelstan King was made prisoner from behind. They carried him bound and gagged into a cavern such as those you visited; and there he was confronted by the Nine Unknown, who asked him whether or not he will promise never to reveal what he had seen.\"\n\nThe Mahatma paused.\n\n\"Did he promise?\" I asked him.\n\n\"He refused. What was more, he dared them to make away with him, saying that the mahout who had accompanied us hither would already have informed the Maharajah Jihanbihar, who would certainly report to the Government. And I, standing beside him, confirmed his statement.\"\n\n\"You seem to have acted as prosecuting attorney against yourself!\" I said.\n\n\"No, I simply told the truth,\" he answered. \"We who calculate in terms of eternity and infinity have scant use for untruth. I told the Nine Unknown the exact truth--that this man Athelstan King might not be killed, because of the consequences; and that whatever he might say to certain officers of the Government would be believed. So they let him go again, and set midnight to-night as the hour of the beginning of my death.\"\n\n\"Did King know that his refusal to promise entailed your death?\" I asked.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell him?\"\n\n\"Because it would not have been true, my friend. I had already been sentenced to death. His promise could make no possible difference to my fate. They let him go, and ordered me to present myself at midnight; so I went with him, to preserve him from the cobras in a tunnel through which he must pass. I brought him into this palace by hidden ways, and after I had shown him the audience hall, where these princesses are to meet, he asked me to go and find you--that being easier for me than for him, because none in this palace would be likely to question me, whereas he would be detected instantly and watched, even if not prevented. And when I had found you--and you nearly killed me--some one, as you know, locked the door and shut us in here together. It is all one to me,\" he added with a shrug of the shoulders; \"I have only until midnight at any event, and it makes small difference where I spend the intervening hours. Perhaps you would like to sleep a little? Why not? Sleep, and I will keep watch.\"",
    "About a dozen women entered this time. They did not trouble to tie the Mahatma, but they bound me as the Philistines did Samson, and then threw a silken bag over my head by way of blindfold. The bag would have been perfectly effective if I had not caught it in my teeth as they drew it over my shoulders. It did not take long to bite a hole in it, nor much longer to move my head about until I had the hole in front of my right eye, after which I was able to see fairly well where they were leading me.\n\nWomen of most lands are less generous than men to any one in their power. Men would have been satisfied to let me follow them along or march in front of them, provided I went fast enough to suit them, but those vixens hardly treated me as human. Perhaps they thought that unless they beat, shoved, prodded and kicked me all the way along those corridors and up the gilded stairs I might forget who held the upper hand for the moment; but I think not. I think it was simply sex-venom--the half-involuntary vengeance that the under-dog inflicts on the other when positions are reversed. When India's women finally break purdah and enter politics openly, we shall see more cruelty and savagery, for that reason, than either the French or Russian terrors had to show.\n\nI was bruised and actually bleeding in a dozen places when they hustled me down a corridor at last, and crowded me into a narrow anteroom, where the two harridans who had handled me hardest had the worst of it. I gave them what in elephant stables is known as the \"squeeze,\" crushing them to right and left against projecting walls; whereat they screamed, and I heard the reproving voice of the Mahatma just behind me: \"Violence is the folly of beasts. Patience and strength are one!\"\n\nBut they were not sticking pins into his ribs and thighs to humiliate and discourage him. He was being led by either hand, and cooed to softly in the sort of way that members of the Dorcas Guild would treat a bishop. It was easy enough for him to feel magnanimous. I managed to tread hard on one foot, and to squeeze two more women as they shoved me through a door into a vast audience hall, and the half-suppressed screams were music in my ears. I don't see why a woman who uses pins on a prisoner should be any more immune than a man from violent retaliation.\n\nWhen they had shut the door they stripped the silk bag off over my head and holding me by the arms, four on either side, dragged me to the middle of a hall that was at least as large as Carnegie Hall in New York, and two or three thousand times as sumptuous.\n\nI stood on a strip of carpet six feet wide, facing a throne that faced the door I had entered by. The throne was under a canopy, and formed the center of a horseshoe ring of gilded chairs, on every one of which sat a heavily veiled woman. Except that they were marvelously dressed in all the colors of the rainbow and so heavily jeweled that they flashed like the morning dew, there was nothing to identify any of the women except one. She was Yasmini. And she sat on the throne in the center, unveiled, unjeweled, and content to outshine all of them without any kind of artificial aid.\n\nShe sat under a hard white light directed from behind a lattice in the wall that would have exaggerated the slightest imperfection of looks or manner; and she looked like a fairy-book queen--like the queen you used to think of in the nursery when your aunt read stories to you and the illustrated Sunday supplements had not yet disillusioned you as to how queens wear their hats.\n\nShe was Titania, with a touch of Diana the Huntress, and decidedly something of Athena, goddess of wisdom, clothed in flowing cream that showed the outlines of her figure, and with sandals on her bare feet. Not a diamond. Not a jewel of any kind. Her hair was bound up in the Grecian fashion and shone like yellow gold.\n\nSurely she seemed to have been born for the very purpose of presiding. Perhaps she was the only one who was at ease, for the others shifted restlessly behind their veils and had that vague, uncertain air that goes with inexperience--although one woman, larger looking than the rest, and veiled in embroidered black instead of colors, sat on a chair near the throne with a rather more nervy-looking outline. There were more than a hundred women in there all told.\n\nYasmini's change of countenance at sight of my predicament was instantaneous. I don't doubt it was her fault that I had been mistreated on the way up, for these women had seen me bound by her orders and mocked by her a couple of hours previously. But now she saw fit to seem indignant at the treatment I had suffered, and she made even the ranks of veiled princesses shudder as she rose and stormed at my captors, giving each word a sort of whip-lash weight.\n\n\"Shall a guest of mine suffer in my house?\"\n\nOne of the women piped up with a complaint against me. I had trodden on her foot and crushed her against a door-jamb.\n\n\"Would he had slain you!\" she retorted. \"She-dog! Take her away! I will punish her afterward! Who stuck pins into him? Speak, or I will punish all of you!\"\n\nNone owned up, but three or four of them who had not been able to come near enough to do me any damage betrayed the others, so she ordered all except four of them out of the room to await punishment at her convenience. And then she proceeded to apologize to me with such royal grace and apparent sincerity that I wondered whom she suspected of overhearing her. Wondering, my eyes wandering, I noticed the woman veiled in black. She was an elderly looking female, rather crouched up in her gorgeous shawl as if troubled with rheumatism, and neither her hands nor her feet were visible, both being hidden in the folds of the long _sari_.\n\nThe next instant Yasmini flew into a passion because the Mahatma and I were kept standing. The Mahatma was not standing, as a matter of fact; he had already squatted on the floor beside me. The women brought us stools, but the Mahatma refused his. Thinking I might be less conspicuous sitting than standing I sat down on my stool, whereat Yasmini began showering the women with abuse for not having supplied me with better garments. Considering the long swim, the dusty ride on an elephant, and two fights with women, during which they had been ripped nearly into rags, the clothes weren't half-bad!\n\nSo they brought me a silken robe that was woven all over with pictures of the Indian gods. And I sat feeling rather like a Roman, with that gorgeous toga wrapped around me; I might have been bearing Rome's ultimatum to the Amazons, supposing those bellicose ladies to have existed in Rome's day.",
    "And with an arm about each of us he started to lead the way out through the maze of corridors and halls.\n\nHe was right. She was not to be trusted. She had laughed at King, but the laugh hid desperation, and before we reached the door of the audience hall at least a score of women pounced on King and me to drag us away from the Mahatma and make us prisoners again. And at that the Mahatma showed a new phase of his extraordinary character.\n\nI was well weary by that time of being mauled by women. Suddenly the Mahatma seized my arm, and gave tongue in a resounding, strange, metallic voice such as I never heard before. It brought the whole surging assembly to rigid attention. It was a note of command, alarm, announcement, challenge, and it carried in its sharp reverberations something of the solemnity of an opening salvo of big guns. You could have heard a pin drop.\n\n\"I go. These two come with me. Shall I wait and let the mob come in to fetch me forth?\"\n\nBut Yasmini had had time now in which to recover her self-possession, and she was in no mood to be out-generaled by any man whom she had once tricked so badly as to win his secrets from him. Her ringing laugh was an answering challenge, as she stood with one hand holding an arm of the throne in the attitude of royal arrogance.\n\n\"Good! Let the mob come! I, too, can manage mobs!\"\n\nHer voice was as arresting as his, although hers lacked the clamorous quality. There was no doubting her bravery, nor her conviction that she could deal with any horde that might come surging through the gates. But she was not the only woman in the room by more than ninety-nine and certainly ninety-nine of them were not her servants, but invited guests whom she had coaxed from their purdah strongholds partly by the lure of curiosity and partly by skilful playing on their new-born aspirations.\n\nDoubtless her own women knew her resourcefulness and they might have lined up behind her to resist the mob. But not those others! They knew too well what the resulting reaction would be, if they should ever be defiled by such surging \"untouchables\" as clamored at the gate for a sight of their beloved Mahatma. To be as much as seen by those casteless folk within doors was such an outrage as never would be forgiven by husbands all too glad of an excuse for clamping tighter yet the bars of tyranny.\n\nThere was a perfect scream of fear and indignation. It was like the clamor of a thousand angry parrots, although there was worse in it than the hideous anger of any birds. Humanity afraid outscandals, outshames anything.\n\nYasmini, who would no more have feared the same number of men than if they had been trained animals, knew well enough that she had to deal now with something as ruthless as herself, with all her determination but without her understanding. It was an education to see her face change, as she stood and eyed those women, first accepting the challenge, because of her own indomitable spirit, then realizing that they could not be browbeaten into bravery, as men often can be, but that they must be yielded to if they were not to stampede from under her hand. She stood there reading them as a two-gun man might read the posse that had summoned him to surrender; and she deliberately chose surrender, with all the future chances that entailed, rather than the certain, absolute defeat that was the alternative. But she carried a high hand even while surrendering.\n\n\"You are afraid, all you women?\" she exclaimed with one of her golden laughs. \"Well--who shall blame you? This is too much to ask of you so soon. We will let the Mahatma go and take his friends with him. You may go!\" she said, nodding regally to us three.\n\nBut that was not enough for some of them. The she-bear with her cubs in Springtime is a mild creature compared to a woman whose ancient prejudices have been interfered with, and a typhoon is more reasonable. Half-a-dozen of them screamed that two of us were white men who had trespassed within the purdah, and that we should be killed.\n\n\"Come!\" urged the Mahatma, tugging at King and me. We went out of that hall at a dead run with screams of \"Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!\" shrilling behind us. And it may be that Yasmini conceded that point too, or perhaps she was unable to prevent, for we heard swift footsteps following, and I threw off that fifteen thousand dollar toga in order to be able to run more swiftly.\n\nThe Mahatma seemed to know that palace as a rat knows the runs among the tree-roots, and he took us down dark passages and stairs into the open with a speed that, if it did not baffle pursuit, at any rate made it easier for pursuers to pretend to lose us. Yasmini was no fool. She probably called the pursuit off.\n\nWe emerged into the same courtyard, where the marble stairs descended to the pool containing one great alligator. And we hurried from court to court to the same cage where the panther pressed himself against the bars, simultaneously showing fangs at King and me, and begging to have his ears rubbed. The Mahatma opened the cage-door, again using no key that I could detect, although it was a padlock that he unfastened and shoved the brute to one side, holding him by the scruff of the neck while King and I made swift tracks for the door at the back of the cage.\n\nBut this time we did not go through the tunnel full of rats and cobras. There was another passage on the same level with the courtyard that led from dark chamber to chamber until we emerged at last through an opening in the wall behind the huge image of a god into the gloom of the Tirthankers' temple--not that part of it that we had visited before, but another section fronting on the street.",
    "Ten of us, including four policemen, called on the Maharajah Jihanbihar five full days after King and I had last seen the Mahatma; and after we had wasted half a morning in pleasantries and jokes about stealing a ride on his elephant, we rode in the Maharajah's two-horse landaus to the Tirthanker temple, where a priest, who looked blankly amazed, consented at once to be our guide through the sacred caverns.\n\nBut he said they were no longer sacred. He assured us they had not been used at all for centuries. And with a final word of caution against cobras he led the way, swinging a lantern with no more suggestion of anything unusual than if he had been our servant seeing us home on a dark night.\n\nHe even offered to take us through the cobra tunnel, but an acting deputy high commissioner turned on a flashlight and showed those goose-neck heads all bobbing in the dark, and that put an end to all talk of that venture, although the priest was cross-examined as to his willingness to go down there, and said he was certainly willing, and everybody voted that \"deuced remarkable,\" but \"didn't believe the beggar\" nevertheless.\n\nHe showed us the \"Pool of Terrors,\" filled with sacred alligators that he assured us were fed on goats provided by the superstitious townsfolk. He said that they were so tame that they would not attack a man, and offered to prove it by walking in. Since that entailed no risk to the committee they permitted him to do it, and he walked alone across the causeway that had given King and me such trouble a few nights before. Far from attacking him, the alligators turned their backs and swam away.\n\nThe committee waxed scornful and made numbers of jokes about King and me of a sort that a man doesn't listen to meekly is a rule. So I urged the committee to try the same trick, and they all refused. Then a rather bright notion occurred to me, and I stepped in myself, treading gingerly along the underwater causeway. And I was hardly in the water before the brutes all turned and came hurrying back--which took a little of the steam out of that committee of investigation. They became less free with their opinions.\n\nSo we all walked around the alligator pool by a passage that the priest showed us, and one by one we entered all the caves in which King and I had seen the fakirs and the victims undergoing torture.\n\nThe caves were the same, except that they were cleaner, and the ashes had all been washed away. There was nobody in them; not one soul, nor even a sign to betray that any one had been there for a thousand years.\n\nThere were the same cells surrounding the cavern in which the old fellow had sat reading from a roll of manuscript; but the cells were absolutely empty. I suggested taking flashlight photographs and fingerprint impressions of the doors and walls. But nobody had any magnesium, and the policemen said the doors might have been scrubbed in any case, so what was the use. And the priest with the lantern sneered, and the others laughed with him, so that King and I were made to look foolish once more.\n\nThen we all went up to the temple courtyard, and descended the stairs through the hole in the floor of the cupola-covered stone platform. And there stood the lingam on its altar at the foot of the stairs, and there were the doors just as we had left them, looking as if they had been pressed into the molten stone by an enormous thumb. I thought we were going to be able to prove something of our story at last.\n\nBut not so. The priest opened the first door by kicking on it with his toe, and one by one we filed along the narrow passage in pitch darkness that was broken only by the swinging lantern carried by the man in front and the occasional flashes of an electric torch. King, one pace ahead of me, swore to himself savagely all the way, and although I did not feel as keenly as he did about it, because it meant a lot less to me what the committee might think, I surely did sympathize with him.\n\nIf we had come sooner it was beyond belief that we should not have caught those experts at their business, or at any rate in process of removing the tools of their strange trade. There must have been some mechanism connected with their golden light, for instance, but we could discover neither light nor any trace of the means of making it. Naturally the committee refused to believe that there had ever been any.\n\nThe caverns were there, just as we had seen them, only without their contents. The granite table, on which we had seen Benares, London and New York, was gone. The boxes and rolls of manuscript had vanished from the cavern in which the little ex-fat man had changed lead into gold before our eyes. The pit in the center of the cavern in which the fire-walkers had performed, still held ashes, but the ashes were cold and had either been slaked with water, or else water had been admitted into the pit from below. At any rate, the pit was flooded, and nobody wanted the job of wading into it to look for apparatus. So there may have been paraphernalia hidden under those ashes for aught that I know. It was a perfectly ridiculous investigation; its findings were not worth a moment's attention of any genuine scientist. Subsequently, newspaper editors wrote glibly of the gullibility of the human mind, with King's name and mine in full-sized letters in the middle of the article.\n\nAbout the only circumstance that the investigating committee could not make jokes about was the cleanliness of all the passages and chambers. There was no dust, no dirt anywhere. You could have eaten off the floor, and there was no way of explaining how the dust of ages had not accumulated, unless those caverns had been occupied and thoroughly cleaned within a short space of time.\n\nThe air down there was getting foul already. There was no trace of the ventilation that had been so obvious when King and I were there before. Nevertheless, no trace could be found of any ventilating shaft; and that was another puzzle--how to account for the cleanliness and lack of air combined, added to the fact that such air as there was was still too fresh to be centuries old."

    "Three men stood ankle deep in mud on the shore of a jungle river, silently watching a ribbon of smoke drift and dissolve above the somber mass of trees to the northwest. Three men of widely different types they were, yet all cradled in the same far-off northern land. The tallest, lean bodied but broad shouldered, black of hair and gray of eye, held himself in soldierly fashion and gazed unmoved. His two mates--one stocky, red faced and red headed; the other slender, bronzed and blond--betrayed their thoughts in their blue eyes. The red man squinted quizzically at the smoke feather as if it mattered little to him where he was. The blond watched it with the wistfulness of one who sees the last sign of his own world fade out.\n\nBehind them, at a respectful distance, a number of swarthy individuals of both sexes in nondescript garments smoked and stared at the trio with the interest always accorded strangers by the dwellers of the Out Places. They eyed the uncompromising back of the tall one, the easy lounge of the red one, the thoughtful attitude of the light one. The copper-faced men peered at the rifles hanging in the right hands of the newcomers, their knee boots, khaki clothing, and wide hats. The women let their eyes rove over the boxes and bundles reposing in the mud beside the three.\n\n\"_Ingles?_\" hazarded a woman, speaking through the stem of the black pipe clutched in her filed teeth.\n\n\"_Notre-Americano_,\" asserted a man, nodding toward the broad hats. \"Englishmen would wear the round helmets of pith.\"\n\n\"_Mercadores?_ Traders?\" suggested the woman, hopefully running an eye again over the bundles.\n\n\"_Exploradores_,\" the man corrected. \"Explorers of the bush. Have you no eyes? Do you not see the guns and high boots?\"\n\nThe woman subsided. The others continued what seemed to be their only occupation--smoking.\n\nThe smoke streamer in the north vanished. As if moved by the same impulse, the three strangers turned their heads and looked southwestward, upriver. The red-haired man spoke.\n\n\"So we've lit at last, as the feller said when him and his airyplane landed in a sewer. Faith, I dunno but he was better off than us, at that--he wasn't two thousand miles from nowheres like we are. The steamer's gone, and us three pore li'l' boys are left a long ways from home.\"\n\nThen, assuming the tone of a showman, he went on:\n\n\"Before ye, girls, ye see the well known Ja-va-ree River, which I never seen before and comes from gosh-knows-where and ends in the Ammyzon. Over there on t'other side the water is Peru. Yer feet are in the mud of Brazil. This other river to yer left is the Tickywahoo--\"\n\n\"Tecuahy,\" the blond man corrected, grinning.\n\n\"Yeah. And behind ye is the last town in the world and the place that God forgot. What d'ye call this here, now, city?\"\n\n\"Remate de Males. Which means 'Culmination of Evils.'\"\n\n\"Yeah. It looks it. Wonder if it's anything like Hell's Kitchen, up in li'l' old N'Yawk.\"\n\nThey turned and looked dubiously at the town--a row of perhaps seventy iron-walled and palm-roofed houses set on high palm-trunk poles, each with its ladder dropping from the doorway to the one muddy street. Then spoke the tall man.\n\n\"Before you see it again, Tim, you'll think it's quite a town. Above here is nothing but a few rubber estates, seven hundred miles of unknown river, and empty jungle.\"\n\n\"Empty, huh? Then they kidded us on the boat. From what they said it's fair crawlin' with snakes and jaggers and lizards and bloody vampires and spiders as big as yer fist. And the water is full o' man-eatin' fish and the bush full o' man-eatin' Injuns. If that's what ye call empty, Cap, don't take me no place where it's crowded.\"\n\nA slight smile twitched the set lips of the tall \"cap.\"\n\n\"They're all here, Tim, though maybe not so thick as you expect. Lots of other things too. Who's this?\"\n\nThrough the knot of pipe-puffing idlers came a portly coppery man in uniform.\n\n\"Well, I'll be--Say, he's the same chap who came onto the boat in a police uniform. Now he's in army rig,\" the light-haired member of the trio exclaimed. \"O Lordy! I've got it! He's the police force and the army! The whole blooming works! Ha!\"\n\nTim snickered and stepped forward.\n\n\"Hullo, buddy!\" he greeted. \"What's on yer mind?\"\n\n\"_Boa dia_, senhor,\" responded the official, affably. With the words he deftly slipped an arm around Tim's waist and lifted the other hand toward his shoulder. But that hand stopped short, then flew wildly out into the air.",
    "Sleepy eyed and frowzy haired, with shirt unbuttoned and breeches and boots unlaced, Tim emerged from his iron-walled cell into the cool-shadowed main room, blinked at McKay and Knowlton lounging over their morning coffee and cigarettes, stretched his hairy arms, and advanced sluggishly to the table.\n\n\"Yow-oo-hum!\" he yawned. \"Ain't they cute! All dressed and shaved like they was goin' to visit the C. O. And here's pore Timmy Ryan lookin' like a 'drunk and dirty' jest throwed into the guardhouse, and feelin' worse. Top o' the mornin' to ye, gents!\"\n\n\"Same to you, Tim,\" McKay nodded.\n\n\"Who hit you?\" asked Knowlton, squinting at bumps and scratches on Tim's forehead.\n\n\"Nobody. Couple fellers tried to, but they was out o' luck. Oh, I see what ye mean! I done that meself while I was gittin' to bed.\"\n\n\"Waves must have been running high on the ocean last night. Better drink some coffee. Thomaz, another cup--big and black.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Looey. 'Twas kind of an active night, at that.\"\n\n\"I heard you come in,\" vouchsafed McKay. \"Were you trying some high diving in your room?\"\n\n\"Faith, I done some divin' without tryin', but 'twas ragged work--I pulled a belly smacker every time. I got to tame that hammick o' mine. It throwed me four times hand-running and the only way I could hold it down was to unhook it and lay it on the floor.\"\n\n\"Sleep well then?\"\n\n\"I did not. Cap, I thought I knowed somethin' about cooties, but I take it back--I never knowed nothin' about them insecks till last night. Where they come from I dunno, but I'll tell the world they come, and if they wasn't half an inch long I'll eat 'em. They darn near dragged me off whole, and all the sleep I got ye could stick in a flea's eye. Lookit here.\"\n\nHe extended an arm dotted with swollen red spots.\n\n\"Ants!\" said McKay, after one glance. \"Ants, not cooties. They're everywhere. Especially under the floor. That's one reason why folks sleep in hammocks down here. Even then they're likely to come down the hammock cords and drive you out.\"\n\n\"Ants, hey? Never thought o' that. And I'd sooner spend another night fightin' all the man-eatin' jaggers in the jungle than them bugs. It's the little things that count, as the feller said when his wife give him his fourteenth baby.\"\n\nHe downed the thick coffee brought by Thomaz, demanded another cup, accepted cigarette and light from Knowlton, and sighed heavily.\n\n\"Who tried to hit you?\" Knowlton persisted.\n\n\"Aw, I dunno. Two-three fellers took swipes at me with bottles and things. Me and Joey went to a place where they's card games and so on--only place in town where the village sports can git action. Joey offers to buy, and does. Stuff tastes kind o' moldy to me, so I asks have they got any American beer. They have. It's bottled and warm, but it's beer and tastes like home. It goes down so slick I buy another round, and then one more, lettin' in a thirsty-lookin' stranger on the third round. That makes seven bottles altogether. Then I think mebbe I better pay up now before I lose track. Looey, guess what them seven bottles o' suds come to in American money.\"\n\n\"M-m-m! Well, say about three and a half or four dollars.\"\n\n\"That's what I figgered,\" mourned Tim. \"But them highbinders want thirty-two dollars and twenty cents, American gold.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Sad but true. Seems the stuff sells here for four bucks and sixty cents a bottle. Thinkin' I'm gittin' rooked because I'm a tenderfoot, I raise a row to oncet and start to climb the guy. Other folks mix in and things git lively right off. But after I've dropped a couple o' fellers Joey winds himself round me and begs me not to make him arrest me, and also tells me I'm all wrong--that's the regular price. So o'course that makes me out a cheap skate unless I come acrost, and I do the right thing.\"\n\n\"Lucky you had the money on you,\" said McKay, eying him a bit oddly.\n\n\"I didn't,\" chuckled Tim. \"All the dough I had was one pore lonesome ten-spot--the one I got from ye yesterday, Cap. But I don't tell 'em that. I jest wave my hand like thirty-two plunks wasn't nothin' in my young life, and start to work meself out o' the hole. After the two guys on the floor are brought back to their senses I order up drinks for all hands and git popular again. Then I git out the bones.\"",
    "Sleep enveloped the huts. Snores and gurgles rose and fell. Tim himself, for the sake of effect, snored heartily at intervals, though his eyes never closed. Through his mosquito bar he could see only vaguely, but he knew any man walking from the crew's quarters must cast a very visible shadow across that net, and to him the shadow would be as good a warning as a clear view of the substance. But the hours crept on and no shadow came.\n\nAt length, however, a small sound reached his alert ear--a sound different from the regular noises of the bush--a stealthy, creeping noise like that of a big snake or a huge lizard. It came from the ground a few feet away, and it seemed to be gradually advancing toward his own hammock. Whatever the creature was that made it, its method of progress was not human, but reptilian. Puzzled, suspicious, yet doubtful, Tim lifted the rear side of his net, on which no moonlight fell. Head out, he watched for the crawling thing to come close.\n\nIt came, and for an instant he was in doubt as to its character, for around it lay the deep shadow of some treetops which at that point blocked off the moon. It inched along on its stomach, its black head seeming round and minus a face, its body broad but flat--a thing that looked to be a man but not a man. Then, pausing, it raised its head and peered toward the hammock of Knowlton. With that movement Tim's doubts vanished. The lifting of the head showed the face--the face of Francisco, the face of murder. In its teeth was clamped a bare knife.\n\nForthwith Tim applied General Order Number Thirteen.\n\nIn one bound he was outside his net, colliding with Knowlton, who awoke instantly. In another he was beside the assassin, who, with a lightning grab at the knife in his mouth, had started to spring up. Tim wasted no time in grappling or clinching. He kicked.\n\nHis heavy boot, backed by the power of a hundred and ninety pounds of brawn, thudded into the Indian's chest. Francisco was hurled over sidewise on his back. Another kick crashed against his head above the ear. He went limp.\n\n\"Ye lousy snake!\" grated Tim. \"Crawlin' on yer belly to knife a sleepin' man, hey? Blast yer rotten heart--\"\n\n\"What's up?\" barked McKay from his hammock.\n\n\"Night attack, Cap. If ye're comin' out bring along yer gat. Hey, Looey, got yer gun on? Some o' these other guys might git gay. They're comin' now.\"\n\nTrue enough, the Peruvian gang was jumping from its hut. With another glance at the prostrate Francisco to make sure he was unconscious, Tim whirled to meet them, fist on gun.\n\n\"Halt!\" he roared. \"First guy passin' this corner post gits shot. Back up!\"\n\nThe impact of his voice, the menace of his ready gun hand, the sight of Knowlton and McKay leaping out with pistols drawn, stopped the rush at the designated post. But swift hands dropped, and when they rose again the moonlight glinted on cold steel.\n\n\"Capitan, what happens here?\" demanded Jos\u00e9, ominously quiet.\n\n\"Knife work,\" McKay replied, curtly. \"Your man Francisco attempted to creep in and murder Se\u00f1or Knowlton. If you and the rest have similar intentions, now's your time to try. If not, put away those knives.\"\n\n\"Knives! _Por Dios_, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Look behind you.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 looked. At once he snarled curses and commands. Slowly the knives slipped out of sight. The paddlers edged backward to their own shack, leaving their _puntero_ alone.\n\n\"The capitan has it wrong,\" asserted Jos\u00e9. \"We awake to find our _popero_ being kicked in the head. We want to know why. If Francisco has done what you say I will deal with him. That I may be sure, allow me to look.\"\n\n\"Very well. Look.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 advanced, stooped, studied the ground, the position of Francisco's body, the knife still clutched in the nerveless hand. Tim growlingly vouchsafed a brief explanation of the incident. When Jos\u00e9 straightened up, his mouth was a hard line and his eyes hot coals.\n\n\"_Si. Es verdad._ To-morrow we shall have a new _popero_.\"\n\nWith which he stooped again, grasped the prone man by the hair, dragged him into the moonlit space between the huts, and flung him down. \"Juan, bring water!\" he ordered.\n\nOne of the paddlers, looking queerly at him, did so. Jos\u00e9 deluged the senseless man. Francisco, reviving, sat up and scowled about him. His eyes rested on the three Americans standing grimly ready, shoulder to shoulder, before their hut; veered to his mates bunched in sinister silence beside their own quarters; shifted again to meet the baleful glare of Jos\u00e9. His hand stole to his empty sheath.",
    "Within the house the soldiers of fortune halted a moment, adjusting their vision to the sudden diminution of light. Except for the sunshine pouring in at the smoke hole above and at the tiny door behind, the only light in the big room came from small cooking fires scattered about the place, and for the moment details were withheld from the newcomers' sight. Then they found themselves in what seemed a labyrinth of poles and hammocks.\n\nThrough this confusion Yuara passed with familiar step, and in his wake the travelers went to a central fire around which was a comparatively clear space. Beyond, in a big hammock dyed with the symbolic scarlet and black and tasseled with many squirrel tails, sat a fat, small-eyed, heavy-jawed man whose elaborate feather dress and authoritative air proclaimed him chief. Beside him stood Rana and another subchief, lean and somber-faced. Behind this bulwark of tribal might huddled the women and children, staring wide-eyed. As the visitors stopped and returned the chief's unwinking regard the warriors packed themselves at their backs, blocking all chance of exit.\n\nWhen the shuffle of feet had died and no sound was audible, Yuara began to talk. In his deliberate way he told the complete narrative of his journey, which previously he had sketched only in outline. His three companions corroborated his tale from time to time by nods, and when the discovery of the slain hunter's bones was described one of those three stepped forward and laid the dead man's weapons on the ground before the chief. As Yuara went on he touched his bandaged arm and pointed to McKay and Knowlton. And as he concluded he motioned toward Louren\u00e7o.\n\nIgnorant of the Indian language, but guessing the nature of his talk from his motions, the Americans stood patiently awaiting the next move. For a time all three of the chiefs remained silent; but all of them studied McKay, standing bolt upright with arms folded and the belt-wrapped knife partly concealed in the hollow of one elbow. Though it was evident that Yuara had given the captain full credit for saving his life, the faces of the head men showed no sign of friendliness. In fact, their expressions were distinctly ominous.\n\nAt length the chief turned his eyes to Louren\u00e7o. The veteran bushman promptly stepped forward and said his say. At the end he turned, took from McKay the knife, unrolled the belt, and dangled the weapon before the eyes of the rulers. They stared at it in obvious ignorance of its character. Not until the Brazilian drew the blade from its sheath and the glint of steel struck their vision did they show recognition. Then Chief Suba grunted, his little eyes lit up, and he reached for it.\n\nFor a few minutes he sat gloating over the gift, admiring the bone handle, hefting the weight of the long blade, while the subchiefs gazed in envy. When he looked up his face was beaming. But then the sour-faced subchief at his left hand muttered something, and Suba's visage darkened. His eyes rested again on McKay, went to the bandaged arm of Yuara, dropped to his knife--the first steel knife ever owned by him or any man of the Suba tribe--and rose again to the black-bearded captain. Abruptly then he spoke out.\n\nLouren\u00e7o stared in blank astonishment. After a puzzled moment he shook his head as if unable to believe he had heard aright. Suba, scowling, repeated what he had said. Louren\u00e7o shook his head again, this time in vehement denial, and began to talk. But Suba, rising with surprising agility for a man of his weight, stopped him imperiously and spoke with finality. Slowly the Brazilian nodded and turned to his captain.\n\n\"I do not understand this, Capitao. But these are the words of the chief: 'The white man with the black beard tries a trick, but it does not deceive the free men of the forest. The thing which he thinks to be hidden in his own heart is known to Suba and his chiefs. It is known also to the chief Monitaya, and to his chiefs, and to his men also. The white man is bold. And now his own boldness shall be his death. 'Since the white man has said he goes to visit the chief Monitaya, and since by some demon's power the white man has saved the life of Yuara, who is a man of Suba, the men of Suba will allow him to go in peace from this place. But Suba will see that he and his companions go to Monitaya, who will know how to deal with his visitors. The men of Suba will take the strangers at once to the canoes and carry them to Monitaya. 'If the white man of the black beard and the black mind thought the men of the jungle blind to the foulness he would do here, he is a fool. It is useless for him or his men to lie and say they know not what Suba means. Let him look into his own heart and he will know well. 'Suba has spoken.' Something is wrong, Capitao, but I do not know what it is. It will do no good to argue. Let us go at once.\"\n\nSuba snarled commands to the warriors. They trooped toward the door. Without another word or glance at the three chiefs Louren\u00e7o stalked after the Indians, and his comrades followed with stiff dignity.",
    "For an hour or more it swung on among the forested hills before the telegraph instrument was put to use. Then it paused, and the sonorous voice of the xylophone spoke to the jungle. A period of waiting brought no reply.\n\nThe canoe moved on for a mile. Again the mallets beat the wood in the ascending scale of the call. And then, faint, mellow, far off, sounded the answer.\n\nWhile every man sat silent the bars boomed out their fateful news. Slow, brief, deep as a bell tolling a dirge, a reply rolled back. And with the solemnity of a funeral cort\u00e9ge the canoes once more moved on, unhurried, inexorable, the measured swing of the paddles beating like a pulse of doom.\n\nAt length the crew of Yuara held their paddles. Yuara himself turned toward the second canoe and talked a minute. A signal to his men, and his boat proceeded. All the others remained where they were.\n\n\"He goes to Monitaya to speak of us,\" said Louren\u00e7o. \"He will return. We have only to wait.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" grunted Tim, disgustedly. \"We'll wait till night if he takes as long to go through his rigmarole as he done yesterday. If I got to fight I want to hop to it, not set round in the shade o' the shelterin' palm while them guys are heatin' up the stewpot. This waitin' stuff gits my goat.\"\n\n\"You might sing us a song, senhor, to pass the time,\" Pedro suggested, with a tight-lipped smile.\n\n\"Say, I'll do that, jest to show these guys I don't give a rip. And while their ears are dazzled by me melody I'm goin' to git me holster unbottoned and me masheet kinder limbered up. Git set. Here it comes: 'Ol' Hindyburg thought he was swell, Pa-a-arley-voo! He made the kids in Belgium yell, Pa-a-arley-voo! But the Yanks come over with shot and shell And Hindyburg he run like hell, Rinkydinky-parley-voo!'\"\n\nUnder cover of his outbreak, which made the savages clutch their weapons and glare at him in mingled suspicion and amazement, there proceeded a furtive loosening of pistols and machetes.\n\n\"A noble sentiment, and more or less appropriate,\" grinned Knowlton. \"But don't give them another spasm for a few minutes, or they may rise up and kill us all in self-defense. They're on the ragged edge now.\"\n\n\"Aw, them guys dunno how to appreciate good singin'. But I should worry; I got me gat fixed now like I want it.\"\n\nTime dragged past. The Americans and Brazilians smoked and exchanged casual comments on subjects far removed from their present environment. The Mayorunas watched them with unceasing vigilance, as if expecting a sudden break for life and liberty. Their chief had intimated that Monitaya would kill these men; and now was their last chance to try to dodge death. But neither the black-bearded McKay nor any of his mates manifested the slightest concern. And at last the canoe of Yuara came back.\n\nIt came, however, without Yuara himself. The son of Rana had remained at the _malocas_ ahead, whence he sent the command to advance. Closely hemmed in by the men of Suba, the white men's boat surged onward at a brisk pace. Around a bend in the creek it went, and at once the domain of Monitaya leaped into view.",
    "Two big tribal houses, each considerably larger than the one of Suba, rose pompously in a wide cleared space beside the stream. Before them, ranged in a semicircle, stood hundreds of Mayorunas--men, women, children--all silently watching the canoes of the newcomers. In the center of the arc, like the hub of a human half wheel, a small knot of men waited in aloof dignity, four of them adorned with the ornate feather dresses of subchiefs, backed by a dozen tall, muscular savages, each armed with a huge war club. Before all stood a powerful, magnificently proportioned savage belted with a wide girdle of squirrel tails, decked with necklaces of jaguar teeth and ebony nuts, crowned by plumes which in loftiness and splendor surpassed all other headgear present--the great chief Monitaya.\n\nAt the shore, beside a row of empty canoes, Yuara was waiting. He mentioned for his men to bring their dugouts to the regular landing place, and when they obeyed he gave commands. Then he turned and walked toward Monitaya.\n\n\"I go,\" stated Louren\u00e7o, rising. \"You stay here until called. Yuara has told his men to leave all weapons in the canoes.\"\n\nHe walked away after the son of Rana, and if any misgiving was in his heart it did not show in his confident step. Halting before the big chief, he began talking as coolly as if there were not the least doubt of welcome for himself and those with him. Monitaya gave no sign of recognition, of friendliness, or of enmity. Proud, statuesque, he stood motionless, his deep eyes resting on those of the Brazilian.\n\n\"Sultry weather,\" remarked McKay.\n\n\"Just so, Capitao,\" agreed Pedro, narrow eyed. \"We shall soon know whether we shall have storm.\"\n\n\"Indications are for violent thunder and lightning soon,\" Knowlton contributed. \"See those husky clubmen awaiting? Looks as if a public execution were about to be pulled off.\"\n\n\"Yeah. But say, ain't that chief a reg'lar he-man, though! No pot-bellied fathead like that there, now, Suby guy. Hope I don't have to drill him. I bet I won't, neither. He looks like he had brains.\"\n\nHoping Tim was right, but dubious, all watched the progress of the parley. Louren\u00e7o evidently was stating his case in logical sequence, recalling to the chief's mind the time when he had led him to revenge against the Peccaries of Peru, then going on to tell of the arrival of the strangers and the object of their search. Yuara's sudden, quick glance at him showed that the Raposa had been mentioned for the first time. A little later his face became slightly sullen, and the watchers guessed that Louren\u00e7o was now referring in somewhat uncomplimentary terms to the treatment received in the _maloca_ of Suba. Soon after that the Brazilian ended his speech.\n\nIn a deep, quiet tone Monitaya spoke first to Louren\u00e7o, then to one of his subchiefs. The bushman beckoned to his waiting companions. At the same time the subchief stepped out and called two names. As McKay, Knowlton, Tim, and Pedro arose and stepped ashore with the weaponless men of Suba, out from the great human arc came two men. All advanced toward the chief. And though the Americans were studying the central figures as they walked, they also noticed that the pair of Mayorunas who had been summoned were lame. One walked with a stiff knee, the other as if a whole leg was paralyzed.\n\n\"Squad--halt!\" muttered McKay. A step and a half and the four stood aligned and alert, two strides from Monitaya.\n\nThe eyes of the chief dwelt long on McKay, and they were hard eyes. Without shifting his gaze he grunted a few words. The two crippled Indians stumped forward and stared into McKay's face. Through a long minute the Americans felt a sinister tension grow in the air about them. Then, slowly, the cripples turned about and faced their ruler. In the tones of men sure of themselves, they spoke one word.",
    "The whites waited in silent suspense for they knew not what. Far out in the forest a jaguar gave his coughing roar at intervals. Little by little the Red Bone men arose from their squat until they stood erect. A tense stillness held both forces. And the shadows crawled on--on--and reached the farther bank.\n\nThen a Red Bone man shoved his head forward, squinting upstream as if he had heard something move in the rank grass. He began to sneak softly in that direction. At that moment, from the water's edge a little above the camp, sounded a loud hiss.\n\n\nBefore the sound died a sudden thrum of bow cords filled the air. A whisper of five-foot shafts speeding over the water--a rapid-fire series of tiny impacts--a couple of short groans--the thumps of falling bodies--and the Red Bone outpost was no more. Shot through and through by the deadly war arrows of the Mayorunas, they were dead before they struck the ground. And from the men of Monitaya sounded one short, subdued \"Hah!\" of savage satisfaction.\n\n\nUp from the ground where that hiss had sounded rose a tall figure which waved its arms and danced about in impromptu signals. Then it ran for the canoes. Out from the gloom upstream other figures took shape, running fast for the same point. With one simultaneous movement Knowlton and McKay seized the Raposa and rushed with him to the stream.\n\n\n\"Senhores!\" sounded Pedro's voice, low but tense, across the water. \"Be ready!\"\n\n\n\"Ready and waiting!\" snapped McKay. \"Who are those people. Your women?\"\n\n\n\"_Si._ We are not discovered--\"\n\n\nAcross his words smote a long shrill yell from the town.\n\n\n\"_Por Deus._ We _are_ discovered! Get our rifles, for the love of _Deus Padre_.\"\n\n\nHe leaped into a canoe, drove it headlong across, and dived for the _tambo_. Behind him the other figures dashed panting up to the landing. Tucu's voice rasped in swift commands. The fugitives swarmed into other dugouts. The Mayoruna men, still ignorant of the identity of these people, but assured by Tucu's voice and manner that they were not enemies, lowered their weapons and rushed for the water. Up in the town the yelling swiftly grew into a roar, and running figures came pelting toward the creek.\n\n\nThe canoes struck the bank. Some were partly filled, some empty and in tow. Into Pedro's canoe the whites bundled the Raposa, while the Mayorunas got into anything within reach. Louren\u00e7o appeared from nowhere and urged the Americans to open fire. As he spoke, arrows thudded into the ground and the water.\n\n\n\"Take this man and go!\" rasped McKay. \"We're losing our equipment, but--\"\n\n\nHis rifle leaped to his shoulder. Flame spat from it. From the van of the charging Red Bones shrilled a death scream.\n\n\nAgain and again the captain's gun cracked. Knowlton's joined in. Before their rifles grew silent the blunt roar of Pedro's repeater broke out. And with the emptying of their long guns the Americans drew their short ones, and in a concerted ripping crash the forty-fives volleyed death and dismay into the oncoming cannibals.\n\n\nThe rush was checked. For a few seconds the Red Bones wavered and milled about. Into their mass poured a cloud of arrows and blowgun darts from the silent but no less deadly weapons of the Mayorunas. As the whites paused to reload, Pedro opened a new blast from Louren\u00e7o's rifle, which his comrade had passed to him on the run. Louren\u00e7o was not shooting, but working madly and alone to save the equipment. And, thanks to the renewed deadly fire of the guns, he saved it.\n\n\nBefore the wicked belch of the three rifles and the two automatics the Red Bones gave back more and more. Their arrows plunged all around the fighting men, but they fell at random, for the gunmen and the canoes were virtually invisible in the deep shadows. Downstream, Tucu's harsh voice jarred in commands as he straightened out the line of boats.\n\n\nAt the next lull in the firing Louren\u00e7o panted: \"In, comrades! We are loaded. In!\"\n\n\n\"Great guns! Are you still here?\" snapped McKay. \"I told you--\"\n\n\n\"In! Talk later. Come!\"\n\n\nThe three gun fighters swiftly obeyed. With a powerful heave Louren\u00e7o sent the canoe after the others. Americans, Brazilians, and the Raposa hunched up among the packs, all went sliding down a jungle Styx.\n\n\nA moment later the Red Bone warriors, taking heart from the cessation of firing, poured an avalanche of arrows into the spot where they had been. And as the canoe, last in the escaping line, was swallowed up in the impenetrable blackness of the forest a hair-raising screech of diabolical fury blended with a swift succession of splashes back where the cannibals were plunging headlong into the stream to reach the dead or wounded men whom they vainly hoped to find on the farther shore.\n\n\n\"I told you to take this man and go!\" McKay fumed. \"By disobeying orders you risked losing him.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, pipe down, Rod!\" remonstrated Knowlton. \"If they had, where'd we be now? This was the last canoe.\"\n\n\n\"_Si._ It is so,\" added Louren\u00e7o, his voice hard edged. \"As it is, the man and the equipment and you also are here. And let me tell you this, Capitao Makkay, whether you like it or not: Pedro and I would see this wild man and a million others like him in a hotter place than this before we would abandon fighting comrades.\"\n\n\nTo which McKay, finding no adequate answer, made none whatever.",
    "Like a fleet manned by sightless sailors the line of boats blundered on through the blackness. With no guiding light, the canoes bumped the banks and collided with one another in perilous confusion. Speed was impossible, yet speed was imperative. Knowlton and his little flashlight solved the problem.\n\n\n\"Say, fellows, let's take the lead,\" he suggested. \"This little light isn't much, but it's something, and there are some extra batteries in my haversack when this burns out. We can see a little way ahead, and pass back the word to the rest. What say?\"\n\n\n\"_Na terra dos cegos quem tem um olho e rei_--in blindman's land he who has one eye is king,\" said Pedro. \"That little white eye in your box may save us all. Louren\u00e7o, tell those ahead to let us pass.\"\n\n\nWithout question the preceding dugouts swerved, and the boat of the white men slipped by. At the head of the line they found Tucu and his crew struggling manfully to make progress without wrecking the whole fleet at the turns. Vast relief and instant acceptance of the new leadership followed Louren\u00e7o's explanation. At once the floating column began to pick up speed. And it was well that it did.\n\n\nHowls of baffled hate came faintly through the tree mass from the Red Bone town. Some time later more yells of rage sounded, much nearer--back at a place on the creek which the last boat had cleared only a few minutes previously. Some of the Umanuh men had made torches and run along one of the Red Bone trails to a bend in the stream, only to find the water bare of everything but dying ripples.\n\n\nWhether the enemy attempted to follow in canoes the escaping party never knew, for none succeeded in overtaking the rearmost boat. And after that one snarling uproar on the creek bank they heard no more of the land pursuit. The narrow margin of safety gained by the aid of the flashlight proved enough to give a commanding lead, and from that time on the only obstacles to their retreat were those of darkness and winding waters.\n\n\nHour after hour Knowlton squatted in the extreme bow, picking out the turns and snags just ahead and passing the word back to Louren\u00e7o, who, in the stern, steered in accordance with his orders and relayed the course to Tucu, just behind. Amidships, Pedro and McKay plied steady paddles and the Raposa lay all but forgotten on the baggage. There were no halts. If any boat back in the blackness got into difficulties it extricated itself as best it could, unaided by the rest, and fell into a new place in the column.\n\n\nAt last a wan light, which was scarcely a light, but rather a lessening of the density, came about the stream. The renewed racket of birds and beasts announced that up overhead the sky had paled into dawn. Slowly the nearest tree trunks began to take shape in the void, and presently the shore line became visible to all eyes. At the same time Knowlton's tiny lamp dimmed and faded out.\n\n\n\"Another battery gone,\" he announced, opening the case and dropping its contents into the creek. \"Ho-yo-ho-hum! Gee! I'm all in! Eyes feel like a couple of burnt holes. Well, gents, I move that at the first available spot we go ashore, feed our faces, look at the ladies, and perform our morning salute to Umanuh--said salute consisting of applying the right thumb to the end of the nose and snappily twiddling four fingers.\"\n\n\n\"Motion carried.\" McKay's set face relaxed. Then, his glance dropping to the Raposa, it tightened again. \"Oh, hullo, Rand! How you feeling?\"\n\n\nThe unconscious man was unconscious no longer. Moreover, his expression was not that of one just emerging from a stupor and bewildered as to his surroundings. Though he had made no movement to change his position, his eyes indicated that he had been awake for some time. They dwelt steadily on McKay, then strayed past the captain to Pedro, Louren\u00e7o, and the first Mayoruna crew following a few feet behind. His face was inscrutable, and he spoke no word.\n\n\n\"You're with friends. Understand? Friends. You're going home. These Indians are friends, too. Get that? _Friends!_\"\n\n\nThe green eyes hung on McKay's face again; but, as before, no answer came in word, movement, or expression.\n\n\n\"No good, Rod,\" said Knowlton, who could not see the rescued man's face, but watched McKay's. \"'Fraid I knocked his last brains down his throat. Dead from the neck up.\"\n\n\n\"I don't know about that. He doesn't look vacant. See here, Rand. We're going to land and eat! You hungry? Uh-huh. Thought you'd understand that. He's alive, Merry. Maybe not all here, but enough to get us.\"\n\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\nThe blond man turned his attention downstream again. Soon he suggested, \"How about landing at that little open space down there at the left, Louren\u00e7o?\"\n\n\n\"Very good, senhor. It looks dry.\"\n\n\nThe canoe swerved and floated down to a spot on the left shore where bright light poured down from an opening in the overhead wall of foliage.\n\n\n\"Now look here, Rand,\" warned the captain. \"We'll untie you. But if you try to duck into the bush, now or later, you get shot. Shot! Understand?\"\n\n\nHe tapped his pistol, and the gray eyes boring into the green ones were hard as chilled steel. For the first time Rand responded--a slow, short nod.\n\n\nMcKay cut the cord around the wild man's ankles, then stepped ashore and held out a hand. Rand arose quietly, jumped to the earth unassisted, lifted his bad foot and stared at it, then limped onward into a spot where the sun now shone bright and warm, and sat down to bask.\n\n\n\"Have to fix that foot, I expect,\" yawned Knowlton. \"But my eyes right now are one solid ache, and I'm going to rest them. Watch him, will you, Rod? Can't tell what he might do. Of course you wouldn't shoot him, but--\"\n\n\n\"Wouldn't I? Not to kill, no. But if he makes one break I'll drill a leg for him. He's going to the States!\"\n\n\n\"Sure. I'm with you all the way. Now beat it and let me repose myself.\"\n\n\nHe bathed his eyes, then lay down in the canoe with a wet handkerchief across them.",
    "The next four days, though they were days of waiting, were busy enough to satisfy the most impatient Mayoruna warrior.\n\n\nOutposts were established on every route by which the attacking force would be likely to approach the twin _malocas_, the watchmen being given the strictest commands not to fight, nor even to allow themselves to be seen, but to run at top speed with the warning.\n\n\nPoison detachments went forth to collect the ingredients for making deadly the water and the weapons. Those detailed to the work of polluting the streams gathered quantities of blue-blossomed, short-podded plants with yellow roots, the roots being pulped and thrown into the slow currents, which straightway became fatal to man or beast The wurali squad procured their favorite materials and, in a flimsy shed well away from the houses, prepared a plentiful supply of the venomed brew.\n\n\nNew traps were set at points where a man or two might be picked off, though it was realized that these would have little effect on the final result. And inside the big houses men especially skilled in the manufacture of arrows and darts toiled swiftly and steadily from dawn till far into the night.\n\n\nThese activities, however, were only the usual defensive preparations made by the warriors whenever they knew a sizable body of foes was somewhere in the vicinity. It remained for the brains of the white men to devise additional features, simple enough in themselves, but astounding to the savages, who were accustomed only to the primitive battle tactics of their ancestors. For the first time in their lives the cannibals found themselves digging in--and also digging out.\n\n\nAfter a survey of the terrain and a catechism of Louren\u00e7o and Monitaya as to the usual methods of attack and defense, the two officers broached an idea born of the exigencies of the situation. As they expected, the great chief was somewhat slow to approve it, for it involved a literal undermining of the walls of his fortresses. But despite the natural inflexibility of his mental processes he was an unusually intelligent savage, and eventually the patient reiteration of the advantages of the scheme won him first to assent and then almost to enthusiasm. Wherefore the amazed tribesmen were set to work, armed with crude wooden shovels, in digging holes under the logs which sheltered them from man, beast, and jungle demon.\n\n\nAll along the walls, at intervals marked by McKay and Knowlton, the tunnels were dug. At the same time another large gang excavated before each of the _malocas_ a deep, curving trench, the two long pits being separated by a ten-foot space of solid earth affording free passage from the houses to the creek. Meanwhile the women and the older children were weaving flimsy covers from withes and vines. As soon as a tunnel was completed it was masked outside the walls by one of these covers, on which a thin layer of earth and grass was laid. The two trenches were likewise concealed, and the loose earth was carried inside the house and packed solidly against the walls flanking the doors.\n\n\nAt sundown of the fourth day the work was ended. And so well was it done that when the great chief, his subchiefs, and his foreign allies went on a final tour of inspection they could find no sign that the houses were honeycombed with exits or that the ground in front of the little entrances was not solid at all points.\n\n\n\"Rod and I took the idea from those pit traps out on the trails,\" Knowlton explained for the dozenth time. \"Holes are covered to look exactly like the rest of the ground. Every man of us has to be inside when the enemy arrives, but we have to get out quick when the right time comes, so we go under the walls. And can't you see those brave women stealers go kerplunk down into the trenches? Oh boy!\"\n\n\nWhereat Louren\u00e7o and Jos\u00e9 smiled as if enjoying a secret joke. They were. For they knew something of which the Americans were not aware--that Monitaya had improved on the trench-trap idea of the whites by studding the bottom of those trenches with barbed araya bones smeared with wurali.\n\n\n\"Yeah, and I figger them guys 'll git some jolt when these houses, which 'ain't got nobody in 'em but women and kids, begin to spit lead out o' loopholes and spew screechin' cannibals up out o' the ground. Gosh! I wouldn't miss seein' Sworn-off's face for a keg o' beer--and that's sayin' somethin'.\"\n\n\nWherein Tim expressed the general sentiment.\n\n\nSo ended the fourth day. When the fifth broke no man showed himself outside the walls. Except the few outposts, every male of the Monitaya _malocas_ bided within, awaiting with growing tension the arrival of the enemy. It was more than likely, McKay had pointed out, that the main body of the barbarous force led by Schwandorf would be preceded by a handful of scouts, and quite possible that one or more of these would slip past the outguards and spy on the tribal houses. The sight of even one warrior would instantly apprise any such spy that the others must be near, and the word would go back at all speed to the Red Bones. Wherefore the only Monitayans to pass through the tiny doorways that morning were a few young women sent out as bait. These, naturally, took good care to stay near the entrances.\n\n\nWithin, the men waited at their appointed places. Each tunnel had its quota of warriors, the number being divided evenly to assure a speedy and simultaneous exit. The Americans had elected to fight from the _maloca_ of the great chief, while the Brazilians and Jos\u00e9 were to garrison the doorway of the other house as soon as the warning came. Rand, wordless and imperturbable as ever, now was armed with a strong bow and plenty of new arrows with unpoisoned heads; and he, of course, would remain with his own countrymen. Thus, preparations completed, all settled themselves to the interminable hours of waiting.\n\n\nUp on the heaped earth near the doorway, which made the walls practically bullet-proof to a height of six feet and thus would protect the women and children, one or more of the Americans was constantly on the lookout through some inconspicuous loophole. Hour after hour dragged past, and no unusual movement or sound came to reward their vigilance. Under the glare of the sun the roof and walls grew hot; under the silent strain of endless anticipation the impatience of the fighting men became a ferment. At length Pedro, unable to keep still, mounted to a peephole near Knowlton. Scarcely had he put his eye to the opening when both men sucked in their breath.\n\n\nAt the edge of the bush a man's head peered from behind a tree. And at the same moment a single canoe came creeping out of the bush and up to the landing place. The head behind the tree was that of a Red Bone spy. The two in the small canoe were Yuara and a companion from the Suba tribe.\n\n\n\"Louren\u00e7o!\" hoarsely whispered Pedro. \"Yuara comes. Tell girls to run to welcome him and guide him between the pits. A spy is watching. If Yuara walks on the pits he dies and our trap is revealed. _Por amor de Deus_, send girls quickly!\"\n\n\nLouren\u00e7o acted instantly. Seizing two young women, he propelled them doorward, talking swiftly the while. Yuara and his mate were already advancing innocently toward the few girls outside, none of whom had wit enough to warn him. But the two whom the Brazilian had grasped happened to be of quick intelligence, and now they darted out. Before the visiting pair could reach the death trap the girls were upon them, laughing as if delighted to see a man once more, and deftly turning them aside to the point where two unobtrusive stubs marked the bridge of safety.\n\n\nVastly astonished by such effusive welcome from two girls whom they did not know, but by no means displeased thereby, the young warriors of the Suba clan were piloted to the door and inside. As they disappeared, the head of the spy also vanished.\n\n\n\"Woof!\" muttered Knowlton, wiping sweat from his brow. \"That was close! Here's hoping we have no more visitors.\""

  "Robert Louis Stevenson -- The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Two Roses": [
    "The blind leper was now about halfway towards them, and just then the sun rose and shone full on his veiled face. He had been a tall man before he was bowed by his disgusting sickness, and even now he walked with a vigorous step. The dismal beating of his bell, the pattering of the stick, the eyeless screen before his countenance, and the knowledge that he was not only doomed to death and suffering, but shut out for ever from the touch of his fellow-men, filled the lads' bosoms with dismay; and at every step that brought him nearer, their courage and strength seemed to desert them.\n\nAs he came about level with the pit, he paused, and turned his face full upon the lads.\n\n\"Mary be my shield! He sees us!\" said Matcham, faintly.\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered Dick. \"He doth but hearken. He is blind, fool!\"\n\nThe leper looked or listened, whichever he was really doing, for some seconds. Then he began to move on again, but presently paused once more, and again turned and seemed to gaze upon the lads. Even Dick became dead-white and closed his eyes, as if by the mere sight he might become infected. But soon the bell sounded, and this time, without any farther hesitation, the leper crossed the remainder of the little heath and disappeared into the covert of the woods.\n\n\"He saw us,\" said Matcham. \"I could swear it!\"\n\n\"Tut!\" returned Dick, recovering some sparks of courage. \"He but heard us. He was in fear, poor soul! An ye were blind, and walked in a perpetual night, ye would start yourself, if ever a twig rustled or a bird cried 'Peep.'\"\n\n\"Dick, good Dick, he saw us,\" repeated Matcham. \"When a man hearkeneth, he doth not as this man; he doth otherwise, Dick. This was seeing; it was not hearing. He means foully. Hark, else, if his bell be not stopped!\"\n\nSuch was the case. The bell rang no longer.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Dick, \"I like not that. Nay,\" he cried again, \"I like that little. What may this betoken? Let us go, by the mass!\"\n\n\"He hath gone east,\" added Matcham. \"Good Dick, let us go westward straight; I shall not breathe till I have my back turned upon that leper.\"\n\n\"Jack, y' are too cowardly,\" replied Dick. \"We shall go fair for Holywood, or as fair, at least, as I can guide you, and that will be due north.\"\n\nThey were afoot at once, passed the stream upon some stepping-stones, and began to mount on the other side, which was steeper, towards the margin of the wood. The ground became very uneven, full of knolls and hollows; trees grew scattered or in clumps; it became difficult to choose a path, and the lads somewhat wandered. They were weary, besides, with yesterday's exertions and the lack of food, and they moved but heavily and dragged their feet among the sand.\n\nPresently, coming to the top of a knoll, they were aware of the leper, some hundred feet in front of them, crossing the line of their march by a hollow. His bell was silent, his staff no longer tapped the ground, and he went before him with the swift and assured footsteps of a man who sees. Next moment he had disappeared into a little thicket.\n\nThe lads, at the first glimpse, had crouched behind a tuft of gorse; there they lay, horror-struck.\n\n\"Certain, he pursueth us,\" said Dick--\"certain! He held the clapper of his bell in one hand, saw ye? that it should not sound. Now may the saints aid and guide us, for I have no strength to combat pestilence!\"\n\n\"What maketh he?\" cried Matcham. \"What doth he want? Who ever heard the like, that a leper, out of mere malice, should pursue unfortunates? Hath he not his bell to that very end, that people may avoid him? Dick, there is below this something deeper.\"\n\n\"Nay, I care not,\" moaned Dick; \"the strength is gone out of me; my legs are like water. The saints be mine assistance!\"\n\n\"Would ye lie there idle?\" cried Matcham. \"Let us back into the open. We have the better chance; he cannot steal upon us unawares.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said Dick. \"My time is come, and peradventure he may pass us by.\"\n\n\"Bend me, then, your bow!\" cried the other. \"What! will ye be a man?\"\n\nDick crossed himself. \"Would ye have me shoot upon a leper?\" he cried. \"The hand would fail me. Nay, now,\" he added--\"nay, now, let be! With sound men I will fight, but not with ghosts and lepers. Which this is, I wot not. One or other, Heaven be our protection!\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Matcham, \"if this be man's courage, what a poor thing is man! But sith ye will do naught, let us lie close.\"\n\nThen came a single, broken jangle on the bell.\n\n\"He hath missed his hold upon the clapper,\" whispered Matcham. \"Saints! how near he is!\"\n\nBut Dick answered never a word; his teeth were near chattering.\n\nSoon they saw a piece of the white robe between some bushes; then the leper's head was thrust forth from behind a trunk, and he seemed narrowly to scan the neighbourhood before he once again withdrew. To their stretched senses, the whole bush appeared alive with rustlings and the creak of twigs; and they heard the beating of each other's heart.\n\nSuddenly, with a cry, the leper sprang into the open close by, and ran straight upon the lads. They, shrieking aloud, separated and began to run different ways. But their horrible enemy fastened upon Matcham, ran him swiftly down, and had him almost instantly a prisoner. The lad gave one scream that echoed high and far over the forest, he had one spasm of struggling, and then all his limbs relaxed, and he fell limp into his captor's arms.\n\nDick heard the cry and turned. He saw Matcham fall; and on the instant his spirit and his strength revived; With a cry of pity and anger, he unslung and bent his arblast. But ere he had time to shoot, the leper held up his hand.\n\n\"Hold your shot, Dickon!\" cried a familiar voice. \"Hold your shot, mad wag! Know ye not a friend?\"\n\nAnd then laying down Matcham on the turf, he undid the hood from off his face, and disclosed the features of Sir Daniel Brackley.\n\n\"Sir Daniel!\" cried Dick.\n\n\"Ay, by the mass, Sir Daniel!\" returned the knight. \"Would ye shoot upon your guardian, rogue? But here is this\"--And there he broke off, and pointing to Matcham, asked: \"How call ye him, Dick?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Dick, \"I call him Master Matcham. Know ye him not? He said ye knew him!\"\n\n\"Ay,\" replied Sir Daniel, \"I know the lad;\" and he chuckled. \"But he has fainted; and, by my sooth, he might have had less to faint for! Hey, Dick? Did I put the fear of death upon you?\"\n\n\"Indeed, Sir Daniel, ye did that,\" said Dick, and sighed again at the mere recollection. \"Nay, sir, saving your respect, I had as lief 'a' met the devil in person; and to speak truth, I am yet all a-quake. But what made ye, sir, in such a guise?\"\n\nSir Daniel's brow grew suddenly black with anger.\n\n\"What made I?\" he said. \"Ye do well to mind me of it! What? I skulked for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall, Dick. We were ill sped at the battle; we but got there to be swept among the rout. Where be all my good men-at-arms? Dick, by the mass, I know not! We were swept down; the shot fell thick among us; I have not seen one man in my own colours since I saw three fall. For myself, I came sound to Shoreby, and being mindful of the Black Arrow, got me this gown and bell, and came softly by the path for the Moat House. There is no disguise to be compared with it; the jingle of this bell would scare me the stoutest outlaw in the forest; they would all turn pale to hear it. At length I came by you and Matcham. I could see but evilly through this same hood, and was not sure of you, being chiefly, and for many a good cause, astonished at the finding you together. Moreover, in the open, where I had to go slowly and tap with my staff, I feared to disclose myself. But see,\" he added, \"this poor shrew begins a little to revive. A little good canary will comfort me the heart of it.\"",
    "Dick remained rooted to the spot, his eyes wandering about the room, his face a changing picture of various emotions, wonder, doubt, suspicion, and amusement. Gradually, as his mind grew clearer, suspicion took the upper hand, and was succeeded by certainty of the worst. He raised his head, and, as he did so, violently started. High upon the wall there was the figure of a savage hunter woven in the tapestry. With one hand he held a horn to his mouth; in the other he brandished a stout spear. His face was dark, for he was meant to represent an African.\n\nNow, here was what had startled Richard Shelton. The sun had moved away from the hall windows, and at the same time the fire had blazed up high on the wide hearth, and shed a changeful glow upon the roof and hangings. In this light the figure of the black hunter had winked at him with a white eyelid.\n\nHe continued staring at the eye. The light shone upon it like a gem; it was liquid, it was alive. Again the white eyelid closed upon it for a fraction of a second, and the next moment it was gone.\n\nThere could be no mistake. The live eye that had been watching him through a hole in the tapestry was gone. The firelight no longer shone on a reflecting surface.\n\nAnd instantly Dick awoke to the terrors of his position. Hatch's warning, the mute signals of the priest, this eye that had observed him from the wall, ran together in his mind. He saw he had been put upon his trial, that he had once more betrayed his suspicions, and that, short of some miracle, he was lost.\n\n\"If I cannot get me forth out of this house,\" he thought, \"I am a dead man! And this poor Matcham, too--to what a cockatrice's nest have I not led him!\"\n\nHe was still so thinking, when there came one in haste, to bid him help in changing his arms, his clothing, and his two or three books, to a new chamber.\n\n\"A new chamber?\" he repeated. \"Wherefore so? What chamber?\"\n\n\"'Tis one above the chapel,\" answered the messenger.\n\n\"It hath stood long empty,\" said Dick, musing. \"What manner of room is it?\"\n\n\"Nay, a brave room,\" returned the man. \"But yet\"--lowering his voice--\"they call it haunted.\"\n\n\"Haunted?\" repeated Dick, with a chill. \"I have not heard of it. Nay, then, and by whom?\"\n\nThe messenger looked about him; and then, in a low whisper, \"By the sacrist of St. John's,\" he said. \"They had him there to sleep one night, and in the morning--whew!--he was gone. The devil had taken him, they said; the more betoken, he had drunk late the night before.\"\n\nDick followed the man with black forebodings.\n\nFrom the battlements nothing further was observed. The sun journeyed westward, and at last went down; but, to the eyes of all these eager sentinels, no living thing appeared in the neighbourhood of Tunstall House.\n\nWhen the night was at length fairly come, Throgmorton was led to a room overlooking an angle of the moat. Thence he was lowered with every precaution; the ripple of his swimming was audible for a brief period; then a black figure was observed to land by the branches of a willow and crawl away among the grass. For some half hour Sir Daniel and Hatch stood eagerly giving ear; but all remained quiet. The messenger had got away in safety.\n\nSir Daniel's brow grew clearer. He turned to Hatch.\n\n\"Bennet,\" he said, \"this John Amend-All is no more than a man, ye see. He sleepeth. We will make a good end of him, go to!\"\n\nAll the afternoon and evening, Dick had been ordered hither and thither, one command following another, till he was bewildered with the number and the hurry of commissions. All that time he had seen no more of Sir Oliver, and nothing of Matcham; and yet both the priest and the young lad ran continually in his mind. It was now his chief purpose to escape from Tunstall Moat House as speedily as might be; and yet, before he went, he desired a word with both of these.\n\nAt length, with a lamp in one hand, he mounted to his new apartment. It was large, low, and somewhat dark. The window looked upon the moat, and although it was so high up, it was heavily barred. The bed was luxurious, with one pillow of down and one of lavender, and a red coverlet worked in a pattern of roses. All about the walls were cupboards, locked and padlocked, and concealed from view by hangings of dark-coloured arras. Dick made the round, lifting the arras, sounding the panels, seeking vainly to open the cupboards. He assured himself that the door was strong and the bolt solid; then he set down his lamp upon a bracket, and once more looked all around.\n\nFor what reason had he been given this chamber? It was larger and finer than his own. Could it conceal a snare? Was there a secret entrance? Was it, indeed, haunted? His blood ran a little chilly in his veins.\n\nImmediately over him the heavy foot of a sentry trod the leads. Below him, he knew, was the arched roof of the chapel; and next to the chapel was the hall. Certainly there was a secret passage in the hall; the eye that had watched him from the arras gave him proof of that. Was it not more than probable that the passage extended to the chapel, and, if so, that it had an opening in his room?\n\nTo sleep in such a place, he felt, would be foolhardy. He made his weapons ready, and took his position in a corner of the room behind the door. If ill was intended, he would sell his life dear.\n\nThe sound of many feet, the challenge, and the password, sounded overhead along the battlements; the watch was being changed.\n\nAnd just then there came a scratching at the door of the chamber; it grew a little louder; then a whisper:\n\n\"Dick, Dick, it is I!\"\n\nDick ran to the door, drew the bolt, and admitted Matcham. He was very pale, and carried a lamp in one hand and a drawn dagger in the other.\n\n\"Shut me the door,\" he whispered. \"Swift, Dick! This house is full of spies; I hear their feet follow me in the corridors; I hear them breathe behind the arras.\"\n\n\"Well, content you,\" returned Dick, \"it is closed. We are safe for this while, if there be safety anywhere within these walls. But my heart is glad to see you. By the mass, lad, I thought ye were sped! Where hid ye?\"\n\n\"It matters not,\" returned Matcham. \"Since we be met, it matters not. But, Dick, are your eyes open? Have they told you of to-morrow's doings?\"\n\n\"Not they,\" replied Dick. \"What make they to-morrow?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, or to-night, I know not,\" said the other, \"but one time or other, Dick, they do intend upon your life. I had the proof of it; I have heard them whisper; nay, they as good as told me.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" returned Dick, \"is it so? I had thought as much.\"\n\nAnd he told him the day's occurrences at length.",
    "Dick, blowing out his lamp lest it should attract attention, led the way up-stairs and along the corridor. In the brown chamber the rope had been made fast to the frame of an exceeding heavy and ancient bed. It had not been detached, and Dick, taking the coil to the window, began to lower it slowly and cautiously into the darkness of the night. Joan stood by; but as the rope lengthened, and still Dick continued to pay it out, extreme fear began to conquer her resolution.\n\n\"Dick,\" she said, \"is it so deep? I may not essay it. I should infallibly fall, good Dick.\"\n\nIt was just at the delicate moment of the operations that she spoke. Dick started; the remainder of the coil slipped from his grasp, and the end fell with a splash into the moat. Instantly, from the battlement above, the voice of a sentinel cried, \"Who goes?\"\n\n\"A murrain!\" cried Dick. \"We are paid now! Down with you--take the rope.\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" she cried, recoiling.\n\n\"An ye cannot, no more can I,\" said Shelton. \"How can I swim the moat without you? Do you desert me, then?\"\n\n\"Dick,\" she gasped, \"I cannot. The strength is gone from me.\"\n\n\"By the mass, then, we are all shent!\" he shouted, stamping with his foot; and then, hearing steps, he ran to the room door and sought to close it.\n\nBefore he could shoot the bolt, strong arms were thrusting it back upon him from the other side. He struggled for a second; then, feeling himself overpowered, ran back to the window. The girl had fallen against the wall in the embrasure of the window; she was more than half insensible; and when he tried to raise her in his arms, her body was limp and unresponsive.\n\nAt the same moment the men who had forced the door against him laid hold upon him. The first he poinarded at a blow, and the others falling back for a second in some disorder, he profited by the chance, bestrode the window-sill, seized the cord in both hands, and let his body slip.\n\nThe cord was knotted, which made it the easier to descend; but so furious was Dick's hurry, and so small his experience of such gymnastics, that he span round and round in mid-air like a criminal upon a gibbet, and now beat his head, and now bruised his hands, against the rugged stonework of the wall. The air roared in his ears; he saw the stars overhead, and the reflected stars below him in the moat, whirling like dead leaves before the tempest. And then he lost hold, and fell, and soused head over ears into the icy water.\n\nWhen he came to the surface his hand encountered the rope, which, newly lightened of his weight, was swinging wildly to and fro. There was a red glow overhead, and looking up, he saw, by the light of several torches and a cresset full of burning coals, the battlements lined with faces. He saw the men's eyes turning hither and thither in quest of him; but he was too far below, the light reached him not, and they looked in vain.\n\nAnd now he perceived that the rope was considerably too long, and he began to struggle as well as he could towards the other side of the moat, still keeping his head above water. In this way he got much more than halfway over; indeed the bank was almost within reach, before the rope began to draw him back by its own weight. Taking his courage in both hands, he left go and made a leap for the trailing sprays of willow that had already, that same evening, helped Sir Daniel's messenger to land. He went down, rose again, sank a second time, and then his hand caught a branch, and with the speed of thought he had dragged himself into the thick of the tree and clung there, dripping and panting, and still half uncertain of his escape.\n\nBut all this had not been done without a considerable splashing, which had so far indicated his position to the men along the battlements. Arrows and quarrels fell thick around him in the darkness, thick like driving hail; and suddenly a torch was thrown down--flared through the air in its swift passage--stuck for a moment on the edge of the bank, where it burned high and lit up its whole surroundings like a bonfire--and then, in a good hour for Dick, slipped off, plumped into the moat, and was instantly extinguished.\n\nIt had served its purpose. The marksmen had had time to see the willow, and Dick ensconced among its boughs; and though the lad instantly sprang higher up the bank, and ran for his life, he was yet not quick enough to escape a shot. An arrow struck him in the shoulder, another grazed his head.\n\nThe pain of his wounds lent him wings; and he had no sooner got upon the level than he took to his heels and ran straight before him in the dark, without a thought for the direction of his flight.\n\nFor a few steps missiles followed him, but these soon ceased; and when at length he came to a halt and looked behind, he was already a good way from the Moat House, though he could still see the torches moving to and fro along its battlements.\n\nHe leaned against a tree, streaming with blood and water, bruised, wounded, alone, and unarmed. For all that, he had saved his life for that bout; and though Joanna remained behind in the power of Sir Daniel, he neither blamed himself for an accident that it had been beyond his power to prevent, nor did he augur any fatal consequences to the girl herself. Sir Daniel was cruel, but he was not likely to be cruel to a young gentlewoman who had other protectors, willing and able to bring him to account. It was more probable he would make haste to marry her to some friend of his own.\n\n\"Well,\" thought Dick, \"between then and now I will find me the means to bring that traitor under; for I think, by the mass, that I be now absolved from any gratitude or obligation; and when war is open, there is a fair chance for all.\"",
    "The skiff of the Good Hope lay among many others, from which it was easily distinguished by its extreme smallness and fragility. Indeed, when Dick and his two men had taken their places, and begun to put forth out of the creek into the open harbour, the little cockle dipped into the swell and staggered under every gust of wind, like a thing upon the point of sinking. The Good Hope, as we have said, was anchored far out, where the swell was heaviest. No other vessel lay nearer than several cables' length; those that were the nearest were themselves entirely deserted; and as the skiff approached, a thick flurry of snow and a sudden darkening of the weather further concealed the movements of the outlaws from all possible espial. In a trice they had leaped upon the heaving deck, and the skiff was dancing at the stern. The Good Hope was captured.\n\nShe was a good stout boat, decked in the bows and amidships, but open in the stern. She carried one mast, and was rigged between a felucca and a lugger. It would seem that Skipper Arblaster had made an excellent venture, for the hold was full of pieces of French wine; and in the little cabin, besides the Virgin Mary in the bulkhead which proved the captain's piety, there were many lockfast chests and cupboards, which showed him to be rich and careful.\n\nA dog, who was the sole occupant of the vessel, furiously barked and bit the heels of the boarders; but he was soon kicked into the cabin, and the door shut upon his just resentment. A lamp was lit and fixed in the shrouds to mark the vessel clearly from the shore; one of the wine pieces in the hold was broached, and a cup of excellent Gascony emptied to the adventure of the evening; and then, while one of the outlaws began to get ready his bow and arrows and prepare to hold the ship against all comers, the other hauled in the skiff and got overboard, where he held on, waiting for Dick.\n\n\"Well, Jack, keep me a good watch,\" said the young commander, preparing to follow his subordinate. \"Ye will do right well.\"\n\n\"Why,\" returned Jack, \"I shall do excellent well indeed, so long as we lie here; but once we put the nose of this poor ship outside the harbour--See, there she trembles! Nay, the poor shrew heard the words, and the heart misgave her in her oak-tree ribs. But look, Master Dick! how black the weather gathers!\"\n\nThe darkness ahead was, indeed, astonishing. Great billows heaved up out of the blackness, one after another; and one after another the Good Hope buoyantly climbed, and giddily plunged upon the further side. A thin sprinkle of snow and thin flakes of foam came flying, and powdered the deck; and the wind harped dismally among the rigging.\n\n\"In sooth, it looketh evilly,\" said Dick. \"But what cheer! 'Tis but a squall, and presently it will blow over.\" But, in spite of his words, he was depressingly affected by the bleak disorder of the sky and the wailing and fluting of the wind; and as he got over the side of the Good Hope and made once more for the landing-creek with the best speed of oars, he crossed himself devoutly, and recommended to Heaven the lives of all who should adventure on the sea.\n\nAt the landing-creek there had already gathered about a dozen of the outlaws. To these the skiff was left, and they were bidden embark without delay.\n\nA little further up the beach Dick found Lord Foxham hurrying in quest of him, his face concealed with a dark hood, and his bright armour covered by a long russet mantle of a poor appearance.\n\n\"Young Shelton,\" he said, \"are ye for sea, then, truly?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied Richard, \"they lie about the house with horsemen; it may not be reached from the land side without alarum; and Sir Daniel once advertised of our adventure, we can no more carry it to a good end than, saving your presence, we could ride upon the wind. Now, in going round by sea, we do run some peril by the elements; but, what much outweighteth all, we have a chance to make good our purpose and bear off the maid.\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned Lord Foxham, \"lead on. I will, in some sort, follow you for shame's sake; but I own I would I were in bed.\"\n\n\"Here, then,\" said Dick. \"Hither we go to fetch our pilot.\"\n\nAnd he led the way to the rude alehouse where he had given rendezvous to a portion of his men. Some of these he found lingering round the door outside; others had pushed more boldly in, and, choosing places as near as possible to where they saw their comrade, gathered close about Lawless and the two shipmen. These, to judge by the distempered countenance and cloudy eye, had long since gone beyond the boundaries of moderation; and as Richard entered, closely followed by Lord Foxham, they were all three tuning up an old, pitiful sea-ditty, to the chorus of the wailing of the gale.\n\nThe young leader cast a rapid glance about the shed. The fire had just been replenished, and gave forth volumes of black smoke, so that it was difficult to see clearly in the further corners. It was plain, however, that the outlaws very largely outnumbered the remainder of the guests. Satisfied upon this point, in case of any failure in the operation of his plan, Dick strode up to the table and resumed his place upon the bench.\n\n\"Hey?\" cried the skipper, tipsily, \"who are ye, hey?\"\n\n\"I want a word with you without, Master Arblaster,\" returned Dick; \"and here is what we shall talk of.\" And he showed him a gold noble in the glimmer of the firelight.\n\nThe shipman's eyes burned, although he still failed to recognise our hero.\n\n\"Ay, boy,\" he said, \"I am with you. Gossip, I will be back anon. Drink fair, gossip;\" and, taking Dick's arm to steady his uneven steps, he walked to the door of the alehouse.",
    "\"Madam,\" said Dick, releasing her, \"I cry you a thousand pardons; but I have no eyes behind, and, by the mass, I could not tell ye were a maid.\"\n\nThe girl continued to look at him, but, by this time, terror began to be succeeded by surprise, and surprise by suspicion. Dick, who could read these changes on her face, became alarmed for his own safety in that hostile house.\n\n\"Fair maid,\" he said, affecting easiness, \"suffer me to kiss your hand, in token ye forgive my roughness, and I will even go.\"\n\n\"Y' are a strange monk, young sir,\" returned the young lady, looking him both boldly and shrewdly in the face; \"and now that my first astonishment hath somewhat passed away, I can spy the layman in each word you utter. What do ye here? Why are ye thus sacrilegiously tricked out? Come ye in peace or war? And why spy ye after Lady Brackley like a thief?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" quoth Dick, \"of one thing I pray you to be very sure: I am no thief. And even if I come here in war, as in some degree I do, I make no war upon fair maids, and I hereby entreat them to copy me so far, and to leave me be. For, indeed, fair mistress, cry out--if such be your pleasure--cry but once, and say what ye have seen, and the poor gentleman before you is merely a dead man. I cannot think ye would be cruel,\" added Dick; and taking the girl's hand gently in both of his, he looked at her with courteous admiration.\n\n\"Are ye, then, a spy--a Yorkist?\" asked the maid.\n\n\"Madam,\" he replied, \"I am indeed a Yorkist, and, in some sort, a spy. But that which bringeth me into this house, the same which will win for me the pity and interest of your kind heart, is neither of York nor Lancaster. I will wholly put my life in your discretion. I am a lover, and my name--\"\n\nBut here the young lady clapped her hand suddenly upon Dick's mouth, looked hastily up and down and east and west, and, seeing the coast clear, began to drag the young man, with great strength and vehemence, up-stairs.\n\n\"Hush!\" she said, \"and come! Shalt talk hereafter.\"\n\nSomewhat bewildered, Dick suffered himself to be pulled up-stairs, bustled along a corridor, and thrust suddenly into a chamber, lit, like so many of the others, by a blazing log upon the hearth.\n\n\"Now,\" said the young lady, forcing him down upon a stool, \"sit ye there and attend my sovereign good pleasure. I have life and death over you, and I will not scruple to abuse my power. Look to yourself; y' 'ave cruelly mauled my arm. He knew not I was a maid, quoth he! Had he known I was a maid, he had ta'en his belt to me, forsooth!\"\n\nAnd with these words, she whipped out of the room and left Dick gaping with wonder, and not very sure if he were dreaming or awake.\n\n\"Ta'en my belt to her!\" he repeated. \"Ta'en my belt to her!\" And the recollection of that evening in the forest flowed back upon his mind, and he once more saw Matcham's wincing body and beseeching eyes.\n\nAnd then he was recalled to the dangers of the present. In the next room he heard a stir, as of a person moving; then followed a sigh, which sounded strangely near; and then the rustle of skirts and tap of feet once more began. As he stood hearkening, he saw the arras wave along the wall; there was the sound of a door being opened, the hangings divided, and, lamp in hand, Joanna Sedley entered the apartment.\n\nShe was attired in costly stuffs of deep and warm colours, such as befit the winter and the snow. Upon her head, her hair had been gathered together and became her as a crown. And she, who had seemed so little and so awkward in the attire of Matcham, was now tall like a young willow, and swam across the floor as though she scorned the drudgery of walking.\n\nWithout a start, without a tremor, she raised her lamp and looked at the young monk.\n\n\"What make ye here, good brother?\" she inquired. \"Ye are doubtless ill-directed. Whom do ye require? And she set her lamp upon the bracket.\n\n\"Joanna,\" said Dick; and then his voice failed him. \"Joanna,\" he began again, \"ye said ye loved me; and the more fool I, but I believed it!\"\n\n\"Dick!\" she cried. \"Dick!\"\n\nAnd then, to the wonder of the lad, this beautiful and tall young lady made but one step of it, and threw her arms about his neck and gave him a hundred kisses all in one.\n\n\"Oh, the fool fellow!\" she cried. \"Oh, dear Dick! Oh, if ye could see yourself! Alack!\" she added, pausing. \"I have spoilt you, Dick! I have knocked some of the paint off. But that can be mended. What cannot be mended, Dick--or I much fear it cannot!--is my marriage with Lord Shoreby.\"\n\n\"Is it decided, then?\" asked the lad.\n\n\"To-morrow, before noon, Dick, in the abbey church,\" she answered, \"John Matcham and Joanna Sedley both shall come to a right miserable end. There is no help in tears, or I could weep mine eyes out. I have not spared myself to pray, but Heaven frowns on my petition. And, dear Dick--good Dick--but that ye can get me forth of this house before the morning, we must even kiss and say good-bye.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Dick, \"not I; I will never say that word. 'Tis like despair; but while there's life, Joanna, there is hope. Yet will I hope. Ay, by the mass, and triumph! Look ye, now, when ye were but a name to me, did I not follow--did I not rouse good men--did I not stake my life upon the quarrel? And now that I have seen you for what ye are--the fairest maid and stateliest of England--think ye I would turn?--if the deep sea were there, I would straight through it; if the way were full of lions, I would scatter them like mice.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" she said, dryly, \"ye make a great ado about a sky-blue robe!\"\n\n\"Nay, Joan,\" protested Dick, \"'tis not alone the robe. But, lass, ye were disguised. Here am I disguised; and, to the proof, do I not cut a figure of fun--a right fool's figure?\"\n\n\"Ay, Dick, an' that ye do!\" she answered, smiling.\n\n\"Well, then!\" he returned, triumphant. \"So was it with you, poor Matcham, in the forest. In sooth, ye were a wench to laugh at. But now!\"\n\nSo they ran on, holding each other by both hands, exchanging smiles and lovely looks, and melting minutes into seconds; and so they might have continued all night long. But presently there was a noise behind them; and they were aware of the short young lady, with her finger on her lips.",
    "Now that they ceased talking, they were aware of a very distant and thin strain of mirthful music which steadily drew nearer, louder, and merrier. The bells in the tower began to break forth into a doubling peal, and a greater and greater concourse of people to crowd into the church, shuffling the snow from off their feet, and clapping and blowing in their hands. The western door was flung wide open, showing a glimpse of sunlit, snowy street, and admitting in a great gust the shrewd air of the morning; and in short, it became plain by every sign that Lord Shoreby desired to be married very early in the day, and that the wedding-train was drawing near.\n\nSome of Lord Shoreby's men now cleared a passage down the middle aisle, forcing the people back with lance-stocks; and just then, outside the portal, the secular musicians could be descried drawing near over the frozen snow, the fifers and trumpeters scarlet in the face with lusty blowing, the drummers and the cymbalists beating as for a wager.\n\nThese, as they drew near the door of the sacred building, filed off on either side, and, marking time to their own vigorous music, stood stamping in the snow. As they thus opened their ranks, the leaders of this noble bridal train appeared behind and between them; and such was the variety and gaiety of their attire, such the display of silks and velvet, fur and satin, embroidery and lace, that the procession showed forth upon the snow like a flower-bed in a path or a painted window in a wall.\n\nFirst came the bride, a sorry sight, as pale as winter, clinging to Sir Daniel's arm, and attended, as brides-maid, by the short young lady who had befriended Dick the night before. Close behind, in the most radiant toilet, followed the bridegroom, halting on a gouty foot; and as he passed the threshold of the sacred building and doffed his hat, his bald head was seen to be rosy with emotion.\n\nAnd now came the hour of Ellis Duckworth.\n\nDick, who sat stunned among contrary emotions, grasping the desk in front of him, beheld a movement in the crowd, people jostling backward, and eyes and arms uplifted. Following these signs, he beheld three or four men with bent bows leaning from the clerestory gallery. At the same instant they delivered their discharge, and before the clamour and cries of the astounded populace had time to swell fully upon the ear, they had flitted from their perch and disappeared.\n\nThe nave was full of swaying heads and voices screaming; the ecclesiastics thronged in terror from their places; the music ceased, and though the bells overhead continued for some seconds to clang upon the air, some wind of the disaster seemed to find its way at last even to the chamber where the ringers were leaping on their ropes, and they also desisted from their merry labours.\n\nRight in the midst of the nave the bridegroom lay stone-dead, pierced by two black arrows. The bride had fainted. Sir Daniel stood, towering above the crowd in his surprise and anger, a clothyard shaft quivering in his left forearm, and his face streaming blood from another which had grazed his brow.\n\nLong before any search could be made for them, the authors of this tragic interruption had clattered down a turnpike stair and decamped by a postern door.\n\nBut Dick and Lawless still remained in pawn; they had, indeed, arisen on the first alarm, and pushed manfully to gain the door; but what with the narrowness of the stalls and the crowding of terrified priests and choristers, the attempt had been in vain, and they had stoically resumed their places.\n\nAnd now, pale with horror, Sir Oliver rose to his feet and called upon Sir Daniel, pointing with one hand to Dick.\n\n\"Here,\" he cried, \"is Richard Shelton--alas the hour!--blood guilty! Seize him!--bid him be seized! For all our lives' sakes, take him and bind him surely! He hath sworn our fall.\"\n\nSir Daniel was blinded by anger--blinded by the hot blood that still streamed across his face.\n\n\"Where?\" he bellowed. \"Hale him forth! By the cross of Holywood, but he shall rue this hour!\"\n\nThe crowd fell back, and a party of archers invaded the choir, laid rough hands on Dick, dragged him head-foremost from the stall, and thrust him by the shoulders down the chancel steps. Lawless, on his part, sat as still as a mouse.\n\nSir Daniel, brushing the blood out of his eyes, stared blinkingly upon his captive.\n\n\"Ay,\" he said, \"treacherous and insolent, I have thee fast; and by all potent oaths, for every drop of blood that now trickles in mine eyes, I will wring a groan out of thy carcase. Away with him!\" he added. \"Here is no place! Off with him to my house. I will number every joint of thy body with a torture.\"\n\nBut Dick, putting off his captors, uplifted his voice.\n\n\"Sanctuary!\" he shouted. \"Sanctuary! Ho, there, my fathers! They would drag me from the church!\"\n\n\"From the church thou hast defiled with murder, boy,\" added a tall man, magnificently dressed.\n\n\"On what probation?\" cried Dick. \"They do accuse me, indeed, of some complicity, but have not proved one tittle. I was, in truth, a suitor for this damsel's hand; and she, I will be bold to say it, repaid my suit with favour. But what then? To love a maid is no offence, I trow--nay, nor to gain her love. In all else, I stand here free from guiltiness.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of approval among the bystanders, so boldly Dick declared his innocence; but at the same time a throng of accusers arose upon the other side, crying how he had been found last night in Sir Daniel's house, how he wore a sacrilegious disguise; and in the midst of the babel, Sir Oliver indicated Lawless, both by voice and gesture, as accomplice to the fact. He, in his turn, was dragged from his seat and set beside his leader. The feelings of the crowd rose high on either side, and while some dragged the prisoners to and fro to favour their escape, others cursed and struck them with their fists. Dick's ears rang and his brain swam dizzily, like a man struggling in the eddies of a furious river.",
    "moonlit night. The moon, which now rode in the mid-heavens, and the extreme whiteness of the snow, made the open ground about the harbour bright as day; and young Shelton leaping, with kilted robe, among the lumber, was a conspicuous figure from afar. Tom and Pirret followed him with shouts; from every drinking-shop they were joined by others whom their cries aroused; and presently a whole fleet of sailors was in full pursuit. But Jack ashore was a bad runner, even in the fifteenth century, and Dick, besides, had a start, which he rapidly improved, until, as he drew near the entrance of a narrow lane, he even paused and looked laughingly behind him.\n\nUpon the white floor of snow, all the shipmen of Shoreby came clustering in an inky mass, and tailing out rearward in isolated clumps. Every man was shouting or screaming; every man was gesticulating with both arms in air; some one was continually falling; and to complete the picture, when one fell, a dozen would fall upon the top of him.\n\nThe confused mass of sound which they rolled up as high as to the moon was partly comical and partly terrifying to the fugitive whom they were hunting. In itself, it was impotent, for he made sure no seaman in the port could run him down. But the mere volume of noise, in so far as it must awake all the sleepers in Shoreby and bring all the skulking sentries to the street, did really threaten him with danger in the front. So, spying a dark doorway at a corner, he whipped briskly into it, and let the uncouth hunt go by him, still shouting and gesticulating, and all red with hurry and white with tumbles in the snow.\n\nIt was a long while, indeed, before this great invasion of the town by the harbour came to an end, and it was long before silence was restored. For long, lost sailors were still to be heard pounding and shouting through the streets in all directions and in every quarter of the town. Quarrels followed, sometimes among themselves, sometimes with the men of the patrols; knives were drawn, blows given and received, and more than one dead body remained behind upon the snow.\n\nWhen, a full hour later, the last seaman returned grumblingly to the harbour side and his particular tavern, it may fairly be questioned if he had ever known what manner of man he was pursuing, but it was absolutely sure that he had now forgotten. By next morning there were many strange stories flying; and a little while after, the legend of the devil's nocturnal visit was an article of faith with all the lads of Shoreby.\n\nBut the return of the last seaman did not, even yet, set free young Shelton from his cold imprisonment in the doorway.\n\nFor some time after, there was a great activity of patrols; and special parties came forth to make the round of the place and report to one or other of the great lords, whose slumbers had been thus unusually broken.\n\nThe night was already well spent before Dick ventured from his hiding-place and came, safe and sound, but aching with cold and bruises, to the door of the Goat and Bagpipes. As the law required, there was neither fire nor candle in the house; but he groped his way into a corner of the icy guest-room, found an end of a blanket, which he hitched around his shoulders, and creeping close to the nearest sleeper, was soon lost in slumber.",
    "The whole distance to be crossed was not above a quarter of a mile. But they had no sooner debauched beyond the cover of the trees than they were aware of people fleeing and screaming in the snowy meadows upon either hand. Almost at the same moment a great rumour began to arise, and spread and grow continually louder in the town; and they were not yet halfway to the nearest house before the bells began to ring backward from the steeple.\n\nThe young duke ground his teeth together. By these so early signals of alarm he feared to find his enemies prepared; and if he failed to gain a footing in the town, he knew that his small party would soon be broken and exterminated in the open.\n\nIn the town, however, the Lancastrians were far from being in so good a posture. It was as Dick had said. The night-guard had already doffed their harness; the rest were still hanging--unlatched, unbraced, all unprepared for battle--about their quarters; and in the whole of Shoreby there were not, perhaps, fifty men full armed, or fifty chargers ready to be mounted.\n\nThe beating of the bells, the terrifying summons of men who ran about the streets crying and beating upon the doors, aroused in an incredibly short space at least two score out of that half hundred. These got speedily to horse, and, the alarm still flying wild and contrary, galloped in different directions.\n\nThus it befell that, when Richard of Gloucester reached the first house of Shoreby, he was met in the mouth of the street by a mere handful of lances, whom he swept before his onset as the storm chases the bark.\n\nA hundred paces into the town, Dick Shelton touched the duke's arm; the duke, in answer, gathered his reins, put the shrill trumpet to his mouth, and blowing a concerted point, turned to the right hand out of the direct advance. Swerving like a single rider, his whole command turned after him, and, still at the full gallop of the chargers, swept up the narrow bye-street. Only the last score of riders drew rein and faced about in the entrance; the footmen, whom they carried behind them, leapt at the same instant to the earth, and began, some to bend their bows, and others to break into and secure the houses upon either hand.\n\nSurprised at this sudden change of direction, and daunted by the firm front of the rear-guard, the few Lancastrians, after a momentary consultation, turned and rode farther into town to seek for reinforcements.\n\nThe quarter of the town upon which, by the advice of Dick, Richard of Gloucester had now seized, consisted of five small streets of poor and ill-inhabited houses, occupying a very gentle eminence, and lying open towards the back.\n\nThe five streets being each secured by a good guard, the reserve would thus occupy the centre, out of shot, and yet ready to carry aid wherever it was needed.\n\nSuch was the poorness of the neighbourhood that none of the Lancastrian lords, and but few of their retainers, had been lodged therein; and the inhabitants, with one accord, deserted their houses and fled, squalling, along the streets or over garden walls.\n\nIn the centre, where the five ways all met, a somewhat ill-favoured alehouse displayed the sign of the Chequers; and here the Duke of Gloucester chose his headquarters for the day.\n\nTo Dick he assigned the guard of one of the five streets.\n\n\"Go,\" he said, \"win your spurs. Win glory for me: one Richard for another. I tell you, if I rise, ye shall rise by the same ladder. Go,\" he added, shaking him by the hand.\n\nBut, as soon as Dick was gone, he turned to a little shabby archer at his elbow.\n\n\"Go, Dutton, and that right speedily,\" he added. \"Follow that lad. If ye find him faithful, ye answer for his safety, a head for a head. Woe unto you, if ye return without him! But if he be faithless--or, for one instant, ye misdoubt him--stab him from behind.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile Dick hastened to secure his post. The street he had to guard was very narrow, and closely lined with houses, which projected and overhung the roadway; but narrow and dark as it was, since it opened upon the market-place of the town, the main issue of the battle would probably fall to be decided on that spot.\n\nThe market-place was full of townspeople fleeing in disorder; but there was as yet no sign of any foeman ready to attack, and Dick judged he had some time before him to make ready his defence.\n\nThe two houses at the end stood deserted, with open doors, as the inhabitants had left them in their flight, and from these he had the furniture hastily tossed forth and piled into a barrier in the entry of the lane. A hundred men were placed at his disposal, and of these he threw the more part into the houses, where they might lie in shelter and deliver their arrows from the windows. With the rest, under his own immediate eye, he lined the barricade.",
    "\"Madam,\" said the miserable Dick, \"I do partly see mine error. I have made too much haste; I have been busy before my time. Already I stole a ship--thinking, I do swear it, to do well--and thereby brought about the death of many innocent, and the grief and ruin of a poor old man whose face this very day hath stabbed me like a dagger. And for this morning, I did but design to do myself credit, and get fame to marry with, and, behold! I have brought about the death of your dear kinsman that was good to me. And what besides, I know not. For, alas! I may have set York upon the throne, and that may be the worser cause, and may do hurt to England. O, madam, I do see my sin. I am unfit for life. I will, for penance sake and to avoid worse evil, once I have finished this adventure, get me to a cloister. I will forswear Joanna and the trade of arms. I will be a friar, and pray for your good kinsman's spirit all my days.\"\n\nIt appeared to Dick, in this extremity of his humiliation and repentance, that the young lady had laughed.\n\nRaising his countenance, he found her looking down upon him, in the fire-light, with a somewhat peculiar but not unkind expression.\n\n\"Madam,\" he cried, thinking the laughter to have been an illusion of his hearing, but still, from her changed looks, hoping to have touched her heart, \"madam, will not this content you? I give up all to undo what I have done amiss; I make heaven certain for Lord Risingham. And all this upon the very day that I have won my spurs, and thought myself the happiest young gentleman on ground.\"\n\n\"O boy,\" she said--\"good boy!\"\n\nAnd then, to the extreme surprise of Dick, she first very tenderly wiped the tears away from his cheeks, and then, as if yielding to a sudden impulse, threw both her arms about his neck, drew up his face, and kissed him. A pitiful bewilderment came over simple-minded Dick.\n\n\"But come,\" she said, with great cheerfulness, \"you that are a captain, ye must eat. Why sup ye not?\"\n\n\"Dear Mistress Risingham,\" replied Dick, \"I did but wait first upon my prisoner; but, to say truth, penitence will no longer suffer me to endure the sight of food. I were better to fast, dear lady, and to pray.\"\n\n\"Call me Alicia,\" she said; \"are we not old friends? And now, come, I will eat with you, bit for bit and sup for sup; so if ye eat not, neither will I; but if ye eat hearty, I will dine like a ploughman.\"\n\nSo there and then she fell to; and Dick, who had an excellent stomach, proceeded to bear her company, at first with great reluctance, but gradually, as he entered into the spirit, with more and more vigour and devotion: until, at last, he forgot even to watch his model, and most heartily repaired the expenses of his day of labour and excitement.\n\n\"Lion-driver,\" she said, at length, \"ye do not admire a maid in a man's jerkin?\"\n\nThe moon was now up; and they were only waiting to repose the wearied horses. By the moon's light, the still penitent but now well-fed Richard beheld her looking somewhat coquettishly down upon him.\n\n\"Madam\"--he stammered, surprised at this new turn in her manners.\n\n\"Nay,\" she interrupted, \"it skills not to deny; Joanna hath told me, but come, Sir Lion-driver, look at me--am I so homely--come!\"\n\nAnd she made bright eyes at him.\n\n\"Ye are something smallish, indeed\"--began Dick.\n\nAnd here again she interrupted him, this time with a ringing peal of laughter that completed his confusion and surprise.\n\n\"Smallish!\" she cried. \"Nay, now, be honest as ye are bold; I am a dwarf, or little better; but for all that--come, tell me!--for all that, passably fair to look upon; is't not so?\"\n\n\"Nay, madam, exceedingly fair,\" said the distressed knight, pitifully trying to seem easy.\n\n\"And a man would be right glad to wed me?\" she pursued.\n\n\"O, madam, right glad!\" agreed Dick.\n\n\"Call me Alicia,\" said she.\n\n\"Alicia,\" quoth Sir Richard.\n\n\"Well, then, lion-driver,\" she continued, \"sith that ye slew my kinsman, and left me without stay, ye owe me, in honour, every reparation; do ye not?\"\n\n\"I do, madam,\" said Dick. \"Although, upon my heart, I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight's blood.\"\n\n\"Would ye evade me?\" she cried.\n\n\"Madam, not so. I have told you; at your bidding, I will even turn me a monk,\" said Richard.\n\n\"Then, in honour, ye belong to me?\" she concluded.\n\n\"In honour, madam, I suppose\"--began the young man.\n\n\"Go to!\" she interrupted; \"ye are too full of catches. In honour do ye belong to me, till ye have paid the evil?\"\n\n\"In honour, I do,\" said Dick.\n\n\"Hear, then,\" she continued; \"Ye would make but a sad friar, methinks; and since I am to dispose of you at pleasure, I will even take you for my husband. Nay, now, no words!\" cried she. \"They will avail you nothing. For see how just it is, that you who deprived me of one home, should supply me with another. And as for Joanna, she will be the first, believe me, to commend the change; for, after all, as we be dear friends, what matters it with which of us ye wed? Not one whit!\""

  "H. Rider Haggard -- The Ancient Allan": [
    "Now I, Allan Quatermain, come to the weirdest (with one or two exceptions perhaps) of all the experiences which it has amused me to employ my idle hours in recording here in a strange land, for after all England is strange to me. I grow elderly. I have, as I suppose, passed the period of enterprise and adventure and I should be well satisfied with the lot that Fate has given to my unworthy self.\n\nTo begin with, I am still alive and in health when by all the rules I should have been dead many times over. I suppose I ought to be thankful for that but, before expressing an opinion on the point, I should have to be quite sure whether it is better to be alive or dead. The religious plump for the latter, though I have never observed that the religious are more eager to die than the rest of us poor mortals.\n\nFor instance, if they are told that their holy hearts are wrong, they spend time and much money in rushing to a place called Nauheim in Germany, to put them right by means of water-drinking, thereby shortening their hours of heavenly bliss and depriving their heirs of a certain amount of cash. The same thing applies to Buxton in my own neighbourhood and gout, especially when it threatens the stomach or the throat. Even archbishops will do these things, to say nothing of such small fry as deans, or stout and prominent lay figures of the Church.\n\nFrom common sinners like myself such conduct might be expected, but in the case of those who are obviously poised on the topmost rungs of the Jacobean\u2014I mean, the heavenly\u2014ladder, it is legitimate to inquire why they show such reluctance in jumping off. As a matter of fact the only persons that, individually, I have seen quite willing to die, except now and again to save somebody else whom they were so foolish as to care for more than they did for themselves, have been not those \u201cupon whom the light has shined\u201d to quote an earnest paper I chanced to read this morning, but, to quote again, \u201cthe sinful heathen wandering in their native blackness,\u201d by which I understand the writer to refer to their moral state and not to their sable skins wherein for the most part they are also condemned to wander, that is if they happen to have been born south of a certain degree of latitude.\n\nTo come to facts, the staff of Faith which each must shape for himself, is often hewn from unsuitable kinds of wood, yes, even by the very best among us. Willow, for instance, is pretty and easy to cut, but try to support yourself with it on the edge of a precipice and see where you are. Then of a truth you will long for ironbark, or even homely oak. I might carry my parable further, some allusions to the proper material of which to fashion the helmet of Salvation suggest themselves to me for example, but I won\u2019t.\n\nThe truth is that we fear to die because all the religions are full of uncomfortable hints as to what may happen to us afterwards as a reward for our deviations from their laws and we half believe in something, whereas often the savage, not being troubled with religion, fears less, because he half believes in nothing. For very few inhabitants of this earth can attain either to complete belief or to its absolute opposite. They can seldom lay their hands upon their hearts, and say they _know_ that they will live for ever, or sleep for ever; there remains in the case of most honest men an element of doubt in either hypothesis.\n\nThat is what makes this story of mine so interesting, at any rate to me, since it does seem to suggest that whether or no I have a future, as personally I hold to be the case and not altogether without evidence, certainly I have had a past, though, so far as I know, in this world only; a fact, if it be a fact, from which can be deduced all kinds of arguments according to the taste of the reasoner.\n\n\nAnd now for my experience, which it is only fair to add, may after all have been no more than a long and connected dream. Yet how was I to dream of lands, events and people whereof I have only the vaguest knowledge, or none at all, unless indeed, as some say, being a part of this world, we have hidden away somewhere in ourselves an acquaintance with everything that has ever happened in the world. However, it does not much matter and it is useless to discuss that which we cannot prove.\n\nHere at any rate is the story.\n\nIn a book or a record which I have written down and put away with others under the title of \u201cThe Ivory Child,\u201d I have told the tale of a certain expedition I made in company with Lord Ragnall. Its object was to search for his wife who was stolen away while travelling in Egypt in a state of mental incapacity resulting from shock caused by the loss of her child under tragic and terrible circumstances. The thieves were the priests of a certain bastard Arab tribe who, on account of a birthmark shaped like the young moon which was visible above her breast, believed her to be the priestess or oracle of their worship. This worship evidently had its origin in Ancient Egypt since, although they did not seem to know it, the priestess was nothing less than a personification of the great goddess Isis, and the Ivory Child, their fetish, was a statue of the infant Horus, the fabled son of Isis and Osiris whom the Egyptians looked upon as the overcomer of Set or the Devil, the murderer of Osiris before his resurrection and ascent to Heaven to be the god of the dead.\n\nI need not set down afresh all that happened to us on this remarkable adventure. Suffice it to say that in the end we recovered the lady and that her mind was restored to her. Before she left the Kendah country, however, the priesthood presented her with two ancient rolls of papyrus, also with a quantity of a certain herb, not unlike tobacco in appearance, which by the Kendah was called _Taduki_. Once, before we took our great homeward journey across the desert, Lady Ragnall and I had a curious conversation about this herb whereof the property is to cause the person who inhales its fumes to become clairvoyant, or to dream dreams, whichever the truth may be. It was used for this purpose in the mystical ceremonies of the Kendah religion when under its influence the priestess or oracle of the Ivory Child was wont to announce divine revelations. During her tenure of this office Lady Ragnall was frequently subjected to the spell of the _Taduki_ vapour, and said strange things, some of which I heard with my own ears. Also myself once I experienced its effects and saw a curious vision, whereof many of the particulars were afterwards translated into facts.\n\nNow the conversation which I have mentioned was shortly to the effect, that she, Lady Ragnall, believed a time would come when she or I or both of us, were destined to imbibe these _Taduki_ fumes and see wonderful pictures of some past or future existence in which we were both concerned. This knowledge, she declared, had come to her while she was officiating in an apparently mindless condition as the priestess of the Kendah god called the Ivory Child.\n\nAt the time I did not think it wise to pursue so exciting a subject with a woman whose mind had been recently unbalanced, and afterwards in the stress of new experiences, I forgot all about the matter, or at any rate only thought of it very rarely.",
    "\u201cMY DEAR MR. QUATERMAIN,\u2014Very strangely I have just seen at a meeting of the Horticultural Society, a gentleman who declares that a few days ago he sat next to you at some public dinner. Indeed I do not think there can be any doubt for he showed me your card which he had in his purse with a Yorkshire address upon it.\n\nA dispute had arisen as to whether a certain variety of Crinum lily was first found in Africa, or Southern America. This gentleman, an authority upon South American flora, made a speech saying that he had never met with it there, but that an acquaintance of his, Mr. Quatermain, to whom he had spoken on the subject, said that he had seen something of the sort in the interior of Africa.\u201d (This was quite true for I remembered the incident.) \u201cAt the tea which followed the meeting I spoke to this gentleman whose name I never caught, and to my astonishment learnt that he must have been referring to you whom I believed to be dead, for so we were told a long time ago. This seemed certain, for in addition to the evidence of the name, he described your personal appearance and told me that you had come to live in England.\n\nMy dear friend, I can assure you it is long since I heard anything which rejoiced me so much. Oh! as I write all the past comes back, flowing in upon me like a pent-up flood of water, but I trust that of this I shall soon have an opportunity of talking to you. So let it be for a while.\n\nAlas! my friend, since we parted on the shores of the Red Sea, tragedy has pursued me. As you will know, for both my husband and I wrote to you, although you did not answer the letters\u201d (I never received them), \u201cwe reached England safely and took up our old life again, though to tell you the truth, after my African experiences things could never be quite the same to me, or for the matter of that to George either. To a great extent he changed his pursuits and certain political ambitions which he once cherished, seemed no longer to appeal to him. He became a student of past history and especially of Egyptology, which under all the circumstances you may think strange, as I did. However it suited me well enough, since I also have tastes that way. So we worked together and I can now read hieroglyphics as well as most people. One year he said that he would like to go to Egypt again, if I were not afraid. I answered that it had not been a very lucky place for us, but that personally I was not in the least afraid and longed to return there. For as you know, I have, or think I have, ties with Egypt and indeed with all Africa. Well, we went and had a very happy time, although I was always expecting to see old Har\u00fbt come round the corner.\n\nAfter this it became a custom with us who, since George practically gave up shooting and attending the House of Lords, had nothing to keep us in England, to winter in Egypt. We did this for five years in succession, living in a bungalow which we built at a place in the desert, not far from the banks of the Nile, about half way between Luxor which was the ancient Thebes, and Assouan. George took a great fancy to this spot when first he saw it, and so in truth did I, for, like Memphis, it attracted me so much that I used to laugh and say I believed that once I had something to do with it.\n\nNow near to our villa that we called \u2018Ragnall\u2019 after this house, are the remains of a temple which were almost buried in the sand. This temple George obtained permission to excavate. It proved to be a long and costly business, but as he did not mind spending the money, that was no obstacle. For four winters we worked at it, employing several hundred men. As we went on we discovered that although not one of the largest, the temple, owing to its having been buried by the sand during, or shortly after the Roman epoch, remained much more perfect than we had expected, because the early Christians had never got at it with their chisels and hammers. Before long I hope to show you pictures and photographs of the various courts, etc., so I will not attempt to describe them now.\n\nIt is a temple to Isis\u2014built, or rather rebuilt over the remains of an older temple on a site that seems to have been called Amada, at any rate in the later days, and so named after a city in Nubia, apparently by one of the Amen-hetep Pharaohs who had conquered it. Its style is beautiful, being of the best period of the Egyptian Renaissance under the last native dynasties.\n\nAt the beginning of the fifth winter, at length we approached the sanctuary, a difficult business because of the retaining walls that had to be built to keep the sand from flowing down as fast as it was removed, and the great quantities of stuff that must be carried off by the tramway. In so doing we came upon a shallow grave which appeared to have been hastily filled in and roughly covered over with paving stones like the rest of the court, as though to conceal its existence. In this grave lay the skeleton of a large man, together with the rusted blade of an iron sword and some fragments of armour. Evidently he had never been mummified, for there were no wrappings, canopic jars, _ushapti_ figures or funeral offerings. The state of the bones showed us why, for the right forearm was cut through and the skull smashed in; also an iron arrow-head lay among the ribs. The man had been buried hurriedly after a battle in which he had met his death. Searching in the dust beneath the bones we found a gold ring still on one of the fingers. On its bezel was engraved the cartouche of \u2018Peroa, beloved of Ra.\u2019 Now Peroa probably means Pharaoh and perhaps he was Khabasha who revolted against the Persians and ruled for a year or two, after which he is supposed to have been defeated and killed, though of his end and place of burial there is no record. Whether these were the remnants of Khabasha himself, or of one of his high ministers or generals who wore the King\u2019s cartouche upon his ring in token of his office, of course I cannot say.\n\nWhen George had read the cartouche he handed me the ring which I slipped upon the first finger of my left hand, where I still wear it. Then leaving the grave open for further examination, we went on with the work, for we were greatly excited. At length, this was towards evening, we had cleared enough of the sanctuary, which was small, to uncover the shrine that, if not a monolith, was made of four pieces of granite so wonderfully put together that one could not see the joints. On the curved architrave as I think it is called, was carved the symbol of a winged disc, and beneath in hieroglyphics as fresh as though they had only been cut yesterday, an inscription to the effect that Peroa, Royal Son of the Sun, gave this shrine as an \u2018excellent eternal work,\u2019 together with the statues of the Holy Mother and the Holy Child to the \u2018emanations of the great Goddess Isis and the god Horus,\u2019 Amada, Royal Lady, being votaress or high-priestess.\n\nWe only read the hieroglyphics very hurriedly, being anxious to see what was within the shrine that, the cedar door having rotted away, was filled with fine, drifted sand. Basketful by basketful we got it out and then, my friend, there appeared the most beautiful life-sized statue of Isis carved in alabaster that ever I have seen. She was seated on a throne-like chair and wore the vulture cap on which traces of colour remained. Her arms were held forward as though to support a child, which perhaps she was suckling as one of the breasts was bare. But if so, the child had gone. The execution of the statue was exquisite and its tender and mystic face extraordinarily beautiful, so life-like also that I think it must have been copied from a living model. Oh! my friend, when I looked upon it, which we did by the light of the candles, for the sun was sinking and shadows gathered in that excavated hole, I felt\u2014never mind what I felt\u2014perhaps _you_ can guess who know my history.\n\nWhile we stared and stared, I longing to go upon my knees, I knew not why, suddenly I felt a faint trembling of the ground. At the same moment, the head overseer of the works, a man called Achmet, rushed up to us, shouting out\u2014\u2018Back! Back! The wall has burst. The sand runs!\u2019\n\nHe seized me by the arm and dragged me away beside of and behind the grave, George turning to follow. Next instant I saw a kind of wave of sand, on the crest of which appeared the stones of the wall, curl over and break. It struck the shrine, overturned and shattered it, which makes me think it was made of four pieces, and shattered also the alabaster statue within, for I saw its head strike George upon the back and throw him forward. He reeled and fell into the open grave which in another moment was filled and covered with the d\u00e9bris that seemed to grip me to my middle in its flow. After this I remembered nothing more until hours later I found myself lying in our house.",
    "Then came dinner and once more I marched to the great hall in her company; Dr. Jeffreys got Mrs. Smith; Papa Smith got Mrs. Jeffreys who looked like a Grecian maiden walking into dinner with the Minotaur; Scroope got one of the Miss Smiths, she who wore a pink bow, the gloomy curate got the other with a blue bow, and Archibald got Mrs. Scroope who departed making faces at us over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou look very grand and nice,\u201d I said to Lady Ragnall as we followed the others at a discreet distance.\n\n\u201cI am glad,\u201d she answered, \u201cas to the nice, I mean. As for the grand, that dreadful woman is always writing to me about the Ragnall diamonds, so I thought that she should see some of them for the first and last time. Do you know I haven\u2019t worn these things since George and I went to Court together, and I daresay shall never wear them again, for there is only one ornament I care for and I have got _that_ on under my dress.\u201d\n\nI stared and her and with a laugh said that she was very mischievous.\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I detest those people who are pompous and rude and have spoiled my party. Do you know I had half a mind to come down in the dress that I wore as Isis in Kendah Land. I have got it upstairs and you shall see me in it before you go, for old time\u2019s sake. Only it occurred to me that they might think me mad, so I didn\u2019t. Dr. Jeffreys, will you say grace, please?\u201d\n\nWell, it was a most agreeable dinner so far as I was concerned, for I sat between my hostess and Mrs. Scroope and the rest were too far off for conversation. Moreover as Archibald developed an unexpected quantity of small talk, and Scroope on the other side amused himself by filling pink-bow Miss Smith\u2019s innocent mind with preposterous stories about Africa, as had happened to me once before at this table, Lady Ragnall and I were practically left undisturbed.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange that we should find ourselves sitting here again after all these years, except that you are in my poor mother\u2019s place? Oh! when that scientific gentleman convinced me the other day that you whom I had heard were dead, were not only alive and well but actually in England, really I could have embraced him.\u201d\n\nI thought of an answer but did not make it, though as usual she read my mind for I saw her smile.\n\n\u201cThe truth is,\u201d she went on, \u201cI am an only child and really have no friends, though of course being\u2014well, you know,\u201d and she glanced at the jewels on her breast, \u201cI have plenty of acquaintances.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd suitors,\u201d I suggested.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied blushing, \u201cas many as Penelope, not one of whom cares twopence about me any more than I care for them. The truth is, Mr. Quatermain, that nobody and nothing interest me, except a spot in the churchyard yonder and another amid ruins in Egypt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have had sad bereavements,\u201d I said looking the other way.\n\n\u201cVery sad and they have left life empty. Still I should not complain for I have had my share of good. Also it isn\u2019t true to say that nothing interests me. Egypt interests me, though after what has happened I do not feel as though I could return there. All Africa interests me and,\u201d she added dropping her voice, \u201cI can say it because I know you will not misunderstand, you interest me, as you have always done since the first moment I saw you.\u201d\n\n\u201c_I!_\u201d I exclaimed, staring at my own reflection in a silver plate which made me look\u2014well, more unattractive than usual. \u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you to say so, but I can\u2019t understand why I should. You have seen very little of me, Lady Ragnall, except in that long journey across the desert when we did not talk much, since you were otherwise engaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. That\u2019s the odd part of it, for I feel as though I had seen you for years and years and knew everything about you that one human being can know of another. Of course, too, I do know a good lot of your life through George and Har\u00fbt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHar\u00fbt was a great liar,\u201d I said uneasily.\n\n\u201cWas he? I always thought him painfully truthful, though how he got at the truth I do not know. Anyhow,\u201d she added with meaning, \u201cdon\u2019t suppose I think the worse of you because others have thought so well. Women who seem to be all different, generally, I notice, have this in common. If one or two of them like a man, the rest like him also because something in him appeals to the universal feminine instinct, and the same applies to their dislike. Now men, I think, are different in that respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps because they are more catholic and charitable,\u201d I suggested, \u201cor perhaps because they like those who like them.\u201d\n\nShe laughed in her charming way, and said, \u201cHowever these remarks do not apply to you and me, for as I think I told you once before in that cedar wood in Kendah Land where you feared lest I should catch a chill, or become\u2014odd again, it is another you with whom something in me seems to be so intimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate for your sake,\u201d I muttered, still staring at and pointing to the silver plate.\n\nAgain she laughed. \u201cDo you remember the _Taduki_ herb?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have plenty of it safe upstairs, and not long ago I took a whiff of it, only a whiff because you know it had to be saved.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind. The question is what shall we _both_ see?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cNo earthly power will make me breathe that unholy drug again.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept me,\u201d she murmured with sweet decision. \u201cNo, don\u2019t think about leaving the house. You can\u2019t, there are no Sunday trains. Besides you won\u2019t if I ask you not.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018In vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird,\u2019\u201d I replied, firm as a mountain.\n\n\u201cIs it? Then why are so many caught?\u201d\n\nAt that moment the Bull of Bashan\u2014I mean Smith, began to bellow something at his hostess from the other end of the table and our conversation came to an end.",
    "Now the chariots turned and passing down a path came to an open space that was cleared of reeds. Here they halted, that of the King and my own side by side with ten paces between them, and those of the court behind. Meanwhile huntsmen with dogs entered the great brake far away to the right and left of us, also in front, so that the lions might be driven backwards and forwards across the open space.\n\nSoon we heard the hounds baying on all sides. Then Bes made a sucking noise with his great lips and pointed to the edge of the reeds in front of us some sixty paces away. Looking, I saw a yellow shape creeping along between their dark stems, and although the shot was far, forgetting all things save I was a hunter and there was my game, I drew the arrow to my ear, aimed and loosed, making allowance for its fall and for the wind.\n\nOh! that shot was good. It struck the lion in the body and pierced him through. Out he came, roaring, rolling, and tearing at the ground. But by now I had another arrow on the string, and although the King lifted his bow, I loosed first. Again it struck, this time in the throat, and that lion groaned and died.\n\nThe King looked at me angrily, and from the court behind rose a murmur of wonder mingled with wrath, wonder at my marksmanship, and wrath because I had dared to shoot before the King.\n\n\u201cThe wager looks well for us,\u201d muttered Bes, but I bade him be silent, for more lions were stirring.\n\nNow one leapt across the open space, passing in front of the King and within thirty paces of us. He shot and missed it, sending his shaft two spans above its back. Then I shot and drove the arrow through it just where the head joins the neck, cutting the spine, so that it died at once.\n\nAgain that murmur went up and the King struck the charioteer on the head with his clenched fist, crying out that he had suffered the horses to move and should be scourged for causing his hand to shake.\n\nThis charioteer, although he was a lord\u2014since in the East men of high rank waited on the King like slaves and even clipped his nails and beard\u2014craved pardon humbly, admitting his fault.\n\n\u201cIt is a lie,\u201d whispered Bes. \u201cThe horses never stirred. How could they with those grooms holding their heads? Nevertheless, Master, the pearls are as good as round your neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence,\u201d I answered. \u201cAs we have heard, in the East all men speak the truth; it is only Egyptians who lie. Also in the East men\u2019s necks are encircled with bowstrings as well as pearls, and ears are long.\u201d\n\nThe hounds continued to bay, drawing nearer to us. A lioness bounded out of the reeds, ran towards the King\u2019s chariot and as though amazed, sat down like a dog, so near that a man might have hit it with a stone. The King shot short, striking it in the fore-paw only, whereon it shook out the arrow and rushed back into the reeds, while the court behind cried, \u201cMay the King live for ever! The beast is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall see if it is dead presently,\u201d said Bes, and I nodded.\n\nAnother lion appeared to the right of the King. Again he shot and missed it, whereon he began to curse and to swear in his own royal oaths, and the charioteer trembled. Then came the end.\n\nOne of the hounds drew quite close and roused the lioness that had been pricked in the foot. She turned and killed it with a blow of her paw, then, being mad, charged straight at the King\u2019s chariot. The horses reared, lifting the grooms off their feet. The King shot wildly and fell backwards out of the chariot, as even Kings of the world must do when they have nothing left to stand on. The lioness saw that he was down and leapt at him, straight over the chariot. As she leapt I shot at her in the air and pierced her through the loins, paralysing her, so that although she fell down near the King, she could not come at him to kill him.\n\nI sprang from my chariot, but before I could reach the lioness hunters had run up with spears and stabbed her, which was easy as she could not move.\n\nThe King rose from the ground, for he was unharmed, and said in a loud voice, \u201cHad not that shaft of mine gone home, I think that the East would have bowed to another lord to-night.\u201d\n\nNow, forgetting that I was speaking to the King of the earth, forgetting the wager and all besides, I exclaimed, \u201cNay, your shaft missed; mine went home,\u201d whereon one of the courtiers cried, \u201cThis Egyptian is a liar, and calls the King one!\u201d\n\n\u201cA liar?\u201d I said astonished. \u201cLook at the arrow and see from whose quiver it came,\u201d and I drew one from my own of the Egyptian make and marked with my mark.\n\nThen a tumult broke out, all the courtiers and eunuchs talking at once, yet all bowing to the mud-stained person of the King, like ears of wheat to a tree in a storm. Not wishing to urge my claims further, for my part I returned to the chariot and the hunting being done, as I supposed, unstrung my bow which I prized above all things, and set it in its case.",
    "The guards led me to my chariot and thrust me into it, and with me Bes. I asked them if they would murder him also, to which the eunuch, Houman, answered No, since he had committed no crime, but that he must go with me to be weighed. Then soldiers took the horses by the bridles and led them, while others, having first snatched away my bow and all our other weapons, surrounded the chariot lest we should escape. So Bes and I were able to talk together in a Libyan tongue that none of them understood, even if they heard our words.\n\n\u201cYour life is spared,\u201d I said to him, \u201cthat the King may take you as a slave.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he will take an ill slave, Master, since I swear by the Grasshopper that within a moon I will find means to kill him, and afterwards come to join you in a land where men hunt fair.\u201d\n\nI smiled and Bes went on, \u201cNow I wish I had time to teach you that trick of swallowing your own tongue, since perhaps you will need it in this boat of which they talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you not say to me an hour or two ago, Bes, that we are fools to stretch out our hands to Death until he stretches out his to us? I will not die until I must\u2014now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy \u2018now,\u2019 Master, seeing that only this afternoon you bade me kill you rather than let you be thrown to the wild beasts?\u201d he asked peering at me curiously.\n\n\u201cDo you remember the old hermit, the holy Tanofir, who dwells in a cell over the sepulchre of the Apis bulls in the burial ground of the desert near to Memphis, Bes?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe magician and prophet who is the brother of your grandfather, Master, and the son of a king; he who brought you up before he became a hermit? Yes, I know him well, though I have seldom been very near to him because his eyes frighten me, as they frightened Cambyses the Persian when Tanofir cursed him and foretold his doom after he had stabbed the holy Apis, saying that by a wound from that same sword in his own body he should die himself, which thing came to pass. As they have frightened many another man also.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Bes, when yonder king told me that I must die, fear filled me who did not wish to die thus, and after the fear came a blackness in my mind. Then of a sudden in that blackness I saw a picture of Tanofir, my great uncle, seated in a sepulchre looking towards the East. Moreover I heard him speak, and to me, saying, \u2018Shabaka, my foster-son, fear nothing. You are in great danger but it will pass. Speak to the great King all that rises in your heart, for the gods of Vengeance make use of your tongue and whatever you prophesy to him shall be fulfilled.\u2019 So I spoke the words you heard and I feared nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it so, Master? Then I think that the holy Tanofir must have entered my heart also. Know that I was minded to leap upon that king and break his neck, so that all three of us might end together. But of a sudden something seemed to tell me to leave him alone and let things go as they are fated. But how can the holy Tanofir who grows blind with age, see so far?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know, Bes, save that he is not as are other men, for in him is gathered all the ancient wisdom of Egypt. Moreover he lives with the gods while still upon earth, and like the gods can send his _Ka_, as we Egyptians call the spirit, or invisible self which companions all from the cradle to the grave and afterwards, whither he will. So doubtless to-day he sent it hither to me whom he loves more than anything on earth. Also I remember that before I entered on this journey he told me that I should return safe and sound. Therefore, Bes, I say I fear nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor do I, Master. Yet if you see me do strange things, or hear me speak strange words, take no note of them, since I shall be but playing a part as I think wisest.\u201d\n\nAfter this we talked of that day\u2019s adventure with the lions, and of others that we had shared together, laughing merrily all the while, till the soldiers stared at us as though we were mad. Also the fat eunuch, Houman, who was mounted on an ass, rode up and said, \u201cWhat, Egyptian who dared to twist the beard of the Great King, you laugh, do you? Well, you will sing a different song in the boat to that which you sing in the chariot. Think of my words on the eighth day from this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will think of them, Eunuch,\u201d I answered, looking at him fiercely in the eyes, \u201cbut who knows what kind of a song you will be singing before the eighth day from this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I do is done under the authority of the ancient and holy Seal of Seals,\u201d he answered in a quavering voice, touching the little cylinder of white shell which I had noted upon the person of the King, but that now hung from a gold chain about the eunuch\u2019s neck.\n\nThen he made the sign which Easterns use to avert evil and rode off again, looking very frightened.",
    "We descended at the great gate of the palace and were led through empty halls that were no longer used now when there was no king in Egypt, to the wing of the building in which dwelt the Prince Peroa. Here we were received by a chamberlain, for the Prince of Egypt still kept some state although it was but small, and had about him men who bore the old, high-sounding titles of the \u201cOfficers of Pharaoh.\u201d\n\nThe chamberlain led me and Bes to an ante-chamber of the banqueting hall and left us, saying that he would summon the Prince who wished to see me before he ate. This, however, was not necessary since while he spoke Peroa, who as I guessed had been waiting for me, entered by another door. He was a majestic-looking man of middle age, for grey showed in his hair and beard, clad in white garments with a purple hem and wearing on his brow a golden circlet, from the front of which rose the _ur\u00e6us_ in the shape of a hooded snake that might be worn by those of royal blood alone. His face was full of thought and his black and piercing eyes looked heavy as though with sleeplessness. Indeed I could see that he was troubled. His gaze fell upon us and his features changed to a pleasant smile.\n\n\u201cGreeting, Cousin Shabaka,\u201d he said. \u201cI am glad that you have returned safe from the East, and burn to hear your tidings. I pray that they may be good, for never was good news more needed in Egypt.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreeting, Prince,\u201d I answered, bowing my knee. \u201cI and my servant here are returned safe, but as for our tidings, well, judge of them for yourself,\u201d and drawing the letter of the Great King from my robe, I touched my forehead with the roll and handed it to him.\n\n\u201cI see that you have acquired the Eastern customs, Shabaka,\u201d he said as he took it. \u201cBut here in my own house which once was the palace of our forefathers, the Pharaohs of Egypt, by your leave I will omit them. Amen be my witness,\u201d he added bitterly, \u201cI cannot bear to lay the letter of a foreign king against my brow in token of my country\u2019s vassalage.\u201d\n\nThen he broke the silk of the seals and read, and as he read his face grew black with rage.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d he cried, casting down the roll and stamping on it. \u201cWhat! Does this dog of an Eastern king bid me send my niece, by birth the Royal Princess of Egypt, to be his toy until he wearies of her? First I will choke her with my own hands. How comes it, Shabaka, that you care to bring me such a message? Were I Pharaoh now I think your life would pay the price.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs it would certainly have paid the price, had I not done so. Prince, I brought the letter because I must. Also a copy of it has gone, I believe, to Idernes the Satrap at Sais. It is better to face the truth, Prince, and I think that I may be of more service to you alive than dead. If you do not wish to send the lady Amada to the King, marry her to someone else, after which he will seek her no more.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me shrewdly and said, \u201cTo whom then? I cannot marry her, being her uncle and already married. Do you mean to yourself, Shabaka?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have loved the lady Amada from a child, Prince,\u201d I answered boldly. \u201cAlso I have high blood in me and having brought much gold from the East, am rich again and one accustomed to war.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you have brought gold from the East! How? Well, you can tell me afterwards. But you fly high. You, a Count of Egypt, wish to marry the Royal Lady of Egypt, for such she is by birth and rank, which, if ever Egypt were free again, would give you a title to the throne.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask no throne, Prince. If there were one to fill I should be content to leave that to you and your heirs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you say, no doubt honestly. But would the children of Amada say the same? Would you even say it if you were her husband, and would she say it? Moreover she is a priestess, sworn not to wed, though perhaps that trouble might be overcome, if she wishes to wed, which I doubt. Mayhap you might discover. Well, you are hungry and worn with long travelling. Come, let us eat, and afterwards you can tell your story. Amada and the others will be glad to hear it, as I shall. Follow me, Count Shabaka.\u201d",
    "When all was done and Peroa and I had touched each other\u2019s breasts and given our word in the name of Amen, we went to the hall in which we had dined, where those whom the Prince had summoned were assembled. Altogether there were about thirty of them, great citizens of Memphis, or landowners from without who had been called together in the night. Some of these men were very old and could remember when Egypt had a Pharaoh of its own before the East set its heel upon her neck, of noble blood also. Others were merchants who dealt with all the cities of Egypt; others hereditary generals, or captains of fleets of ships; others Grecians, officers of mercenaries who were supposed to be in the pay of the King of kings, but hated him, as did all the Greeks. Then there were the high priests of Ptah, of Amen, of Osiris and others who were still the most powerful men in the land, since there was no village between Thebes and the mouths of the Nile in which they had not those who were sworn to the service of their gods.\n\nSuch was the company representing all that remained or could be gathered there of the greatness of Egypt the ancient and the fallen.\n\nTo these when the doors had been closed and barred and trusty watchmen set to guard them, Peroa expounded the case in a low and earnest voice. He showed them that the King of the East sought a new quarrel against Egypt that he might grind her to powder beneath his heel, and that he did this by demanding the person of Amada, his own niece and the Royal Lady of Egypt, to be included in his household like any common woman. If she were refused then he would send a great army under pretext of taking her, and lay the land waste as far as Thebes. And if she were granted some new quarrel would be picked and in the person of the royal Amada all of them be for ever shamed.\n\nNext he showed the seal, telling them that I\u2014who was known to many of them, at least by repute\u2014had brought it from the East, and repeating to them the plan that I had proposed upon the previous night. After this he asked their counsel, saying that before noon he must send an answer to Idernes, the King\u2019s Satrap at Sais.\n\nThen I was called upon to speak and, in answer to questions, answered frankly that I had stolen the ancient White Seal from the King\u2019s servant who carried it as a warrant for the King\u2019s private vengeance on one who had bested him. How I did not mention. I told them also of the state of the Great King\u2019s empire and that I had heard that he was about to enter upon a war with the Greeks which would need all its strength, and that therefore if they wished to strike for liberty the time was at hand.\n\nThen the talk began and lasted for two hours, each man giving his judgment according to precedence, some one way and some another. When all had done and it became clear that there were differences of opinion, some being content to live on in slavery with what remained to them and others desiring to strike for freedom, among whom were the high priests who feared lest the Eastern heretics should utterly destroy their worship, Peroa spoke once more.\n\n\u201cElders of Egypt,\u201d he said briefly, \u201ccertain of you think one way, and certain another, but of this be sure, such talk as we have held together cannot be hid. It will come to the ears of spies and through them to those of the Great King, and then all of us alike are doomed. If you refuse to stir, this very day I with my family and household and the Royal Lady Amada, and all who cling to me, fly to Upper Egypt and perhaps beyond it to Ethiopia, leaving you to deal with the Great King, as you will, or to follow me into exile. That he will attack us there is no doubt, either over the pretext of Amada or some other, since Shabaka has heard as much from his own lips. Now choose.\u201d\n\nThen, after a little whispering together, every man of them voted for rebellion, though some of them I could see with heavy hearts, and bound themselves by a great oath to cling together to the last.\n\nThe matter being thus settled such a letter was written to Idernes as I had suggested on the night before, and sealed with the Signet of signets. Of the yielding up of Amada it said nothing, but commanded Idernes, under the private White Seal that none dared disobey, to wait upon the Prince Peroa at Memphis forthwith, and there learn from him, the Holder of the Seal, what was the will of the Great King. Then the Council was adjourned till one hour after noon, and most of them departed to send messengers bearing secret word to the various cities and nomes of Egypt.\n\nBefore they went, however, I was directed to wait upon my relative, the holy Tanofir, whom all acknowledged to be the greatest magician in Egypt, and to ask of him to seek wisdom and an oracle from his Spirit as to the future and whether in it we should fare well or ill. This I promised to do.\n\nWhen most of the Council were gone the messengers of Idernes were summoned, and came proudly, and with them, or rather before them, Bes for whom I had sent as he was not present at the Council.",
    "Four hours later, the wind being very favourable to us, we reached that place and there took up our station and having made all as ready as we could, rested.\n\nIn the early afternoon Bes awakened me from the heavy sleep into which I had fallen, and pointed to the south. I looked and through the desert haze saw the chariots of Idernes advancing in ordered ranks, and after them the masses of his footmen.\n\nNow we had no chariots, only archers, and two regiments armed with long spears and swords. Also the sailors on the boats had their slings and throwing javelins. Lastly the ground was in our favour since it sloped upwards and the space between the river and the hills was narrow, somewhat boggy too after the inundation of the Nile, which meant that the chariots must advance in a column and could not gather sufficient speed to sweep over us.\n\nIdernes and his captains noted all this also, and halted. Then they sent a herald forward to ask who we were and to command us in the name of the Great King to make way for the army of the Great King.\n\nI answered that we were Egyptians, ordered by Peroa to hold the road against the Satrap who had done affront to Egypt by demanding that its Royal Lady should be given over to him to be sent to the East as a woman-slave, and that if the Satrap wished to clear a road, he could come and do so. Or if it pleased him he could go back towards Memphis, or stay where he was, since we did not wish to strike the first blow. I added this, \u201cI who speak on behalf of the Prince Peroa, am the lord Shabaka, that same man whom but last night the Satrap and a certain captain of his named a liar. Now the Easterns are brave men and we of Egypt have always heard that among them none is braver than Idernes who gained his advancement through courage and skill in war. Let him therefore come out together with the lord who named me a liar, armed with swords only, and I, who being a liar must also be a coward, together with my servant, a black dwarf, will meet them man to man in the sight of both the armies, and fight them to the death. Or if it pleases Idernes better, let him not come and I will seek him and kill him in the battle, or by him be killed.\u201d\n\nThe herald, having taken stock of me and of Bes at whom he laughed, returned with the message.\n\nWe fought a very terrible fight that evening there by the banks of Nile. Our position was good, but we were outnumbered by four or five to one, and the Easterns and their mercenaries were mad at the death of the Satrap by my hand. Time upon time they came on furiously, charging up the slope like wild bulls. For the most part we relied upon our archers to drive them back, since our half-trained troops could scarcely hope to stand against the onset of veterans disciplined in war. So taking cover behind the rocks we rained arrows on them, shooting the horses in the chariots, and when these were down, pouring our shafts upon the footmen behind. Myself I took my great black bow and drew it thrice, and each time I saw a noble fall, for no mail could withstand the arrows which it sent, and of that art I was a master. None in Egypt could shoot so far or so straight as I did, save perhaps Peroa himself. I had no time to do more since always I must be moving up and down the line encouraging my men.\n\nThree times we drove them back, after which they grew cunning. Ceasing from a direct onslaught and keeping what remained of their chariots in reserve, they sent one body of men to climb along the slope of the hill where the rocks gave them cover from our arrows, and another to creep through the reeds and growing crops upon the bank of the river where we could not see to shoot them well, although the slingers in the ships did them some damage.",
    "The feast went on with all the ancient ceremonies that attended the crowning of a Pharaoh of Egypt, since there were old men who remembered these, also the scribes and priests had them written in their books.\n\nI took no heed of them and will not set them down. At length Pharaoh pledged his subjects, and his subjects pledged Pharaoh. Then the doors were opened and through them came a company of white-robed, shaven priests bearing on a bier the body of a dead man wrapped in his mummy-cloths. At first some laughed for this rite had not been performed in Egypt since she passed into the hands of the Great Kings of the East and therefore was strange to them. Then they grew silent since after all it was solemn to see those death-bearing priests flitting in and out between the great columns, now seen and now lost in the shadows, and to listen to their funeral chants.\n\nIn the hush my mother whispered to me that this body was that of the last Pharaoh of Egypt brought from his tomb, but whether this were so I cannot say for certain. At length they brought the mummy which was crowned with a snake-headed circlet of the royal _ur\u00e6us_ and still draped with withered funeral wreaths, and stood it on its feet opposite to Peroa just behind and between my mother and me in such a fashion that it cut off the light from us.\n\nThe faint and heavy smell of the embalmer\u2019s spices struck upon my nostrils, a dead flower from the chaplets fell upon my head and, glancing over my shoulder, I saw the painted or enamelled eyes in the gilded mask staring at me. The thing filled me with fear, I knew not of what. Not of death, surely, for that I had faced a score of times of late and thought nothing of it. Indeed I am not sure that it was fear I felt, but rather a deep sense of the vanity of all things. It seemed to come home to me\u2014Shabaka or Allan Quatermain, for in my dream the inspiration or whatever it might be, struck through the spirit that animated both of us\u2014as it had never done before, that everything is _nothing_, that victory and love and even life itself have no meaning; that naught really exists save the soul of man and God, of whom perchance that soul is a part sent forth for a while to do His work through good and ill. The thought lifted me up and yet crushed me, since for a moment all that makes a man passed away, and I felt myself standing in utter loneliness, naked before the glory of God, watched only by the flaming stars that light his throne. Yes, and at that moment suddenly I learned that all the gods are but one God, having many shapes and called by many names.\n\nThen I heard the priests saying, \u201cPharaoh the Osiris greets Pharaoh the living on the Earth and sends to him this message\u2014\u2018As I am, so shalt thou be, and where I am, there thou shalt dwell through all the ages of Eternity.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen Pharaoh the living rose and bowed to Pharaoh the dead and Pharaoh the dead was taken away back to his Eternal House and I wondered whether his _Ka_ or his spirit, or whatever is the part of him that lives on, were watching us and remembering the feasts whereof he had partaken in his pomp in this pillared hall, as his forefathers had done before him for hundreds or thousands of years.\n\nNot until the mummy had gone and the last sound of the chanting of the priests had died, did the hearts of the feasters grow light again. But soon they forgot, as men alive always forget death and those whom Time has devoured, for the wine was good and strong and the eyes of the women were bright and victory had crowned our spears, and for a while Egypt was once more free.\n\nSo it went on till Pharaoh rose and departed, the great gold earrings in his ears jingling as he walked, and the trumpets sounding before and after him. I too rose to go with my mother when a messenger came and bade me wait upon Pharaoh, and with me the dwarf Bes. So we went, leaving an officer to conduct my mother to our home. As I passed her she caught me by the sleeve and whispered in my ear, \u201cMy son, whatever chances to you, be brave and remember that the world holds more than women.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, \u201cit holds death and God, or they hold it,\u201d though what put the words into my mind I do not know, since I did not understand and had no time to ask her meaning.",
    "Now I began to laugh again and went with Bes to gather the lilies. These grew at the end of a mass of reeds woven together by the pressure of the current and floating on the water. Bes lay down upon his stomach while his people watched from a distance on the bank amazed into silence, and stretched out his long arms to reach the blue lotus flowers. Suddenly the reeds gave way beneath him just as he had grasped two of the flowers and was dragging at them, so that he fell into the river.\n\nNext instant I saw a swirl in the brown water and perceived a huge crocodile. It rushed at Bes open-mouthed. Being a good swimmer he twisted his body in order to avoid it, but I heard the great teeth close with a snap on the short leathern garment which he wore about his middle.\n\n\u201cThe devil has me! Farewell!\u201d he cried and vanished beneath the water.\n\nNow, as I have said, I was almost stripped for bathing, but had not yet taken off my short sword which was girded round me by a belt. In an instant I drew it and amidst the yells of horror of the Ethiopians who had seen all from the bank, I plunged into the river. There are few able to swim as I could and I had the art of diving with my eyes open and remaining long beneath the surface without drawing breath, for this I had practised from a child.\n\nImmediately I saw the great reptile sinking to the mud and dragging Bes with him to drown him there. But here the river was very deep and with a few swift strokes I was able to get under the crocodile. Then with all my strength I stabbed upwards, driving the sword far into the soft part of the throat. Feeling the pain of the sharp iron the beast let go of Bes and turned on me. How it happened I do not know but presently I found myself upon its back and was striking at its eyes. One thrust at least went home, for the blinded brute rose to the surface, bearing me with him, and oh! the sweetness of the air as I breathed again.\n\nThus we appeared, I riding the crocodile like a horse and stabbing furiously, while close by was Bes rolling his yellow eyes but helpless, for he had no weapon. Still the devil was not dead although blood streamed from him, only mad with pain and rage. Nor could the shouting Ethiopians help me since they had only bows and dared not shoot lest their shafts should pierce me. The crocodile began to sink again, snapping furiously at my legs. Then I bethought me of a trick I had seen practised by natives on the Nile.\n\nWaiting till its huge jaws were open I thrust my arm between them, grasping the short sword in such fashion that the hilt rested on its tongue and the point against the roof of its mouth. It tried to close its jaws and lo! the good iron was fixed between them, holding them wide open. Then I withdrew my hand and floated upwards with nothing worse than a cut upon the wrist from one of its sharp fangs. I appeared upon the surface and after me the crocodile spouting blood and wallowing in its death agonies. I remembered no more till I found myself lying on the bank surrounded by a multitude with Bes standing over me. Also in the shallow water was the crocodile dead, my sword still fixed between its jaws.\n\n\u201cAre you harmed, Master\u201d cried Bes in a voice of agony.\n\n\u201cVery little I think,\u201d I answered, sitting up with the blood pouring from my arm.\n\nBes thrust aside Karema who had come lightly clothed from her tent, saying,\n\n\u201cAll is well, Wife. I will bring you the lilies presently.\u201d\n\nThen he flung his arms about me, kissed my hands and my brow and turning to the crowd, shouted,\n\n\u201cLast night you were disputing as to whether this Egyptian lord should be allowed to dwell with me in the land of Ethiopia. Which of you disputes it now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one!\u201d they answered with a roar. \u201cHe is not a man but a god. No man could have done such a deed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it seems,\u201d answered Bes quietly. \u201cAt least none of you even tried to do it. Yet he is not a god but only that kind of man who is called a hero. Also he is my brother, and while I reign in Ethiopia either he shall reign at my side, or I go away with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt shall be so, Karoon!\u201d they shouted with one voice. And after this I was carried back to the tent.\n\nIn front of it my mother waited and kissed me proudly before them all, whereat they shouted again.\n\nSo ended this adventure of the crocodile, except that presently Bes went back and recovered the two lilies for Karema, this time from a boat, which caused the Ethiopians to call out that he must love her very much, though not as much as he did me.",
    "That afternoon, borne in litters, we set out for the City of the Grasshopper, which we reached on the fourth day. As we drew near the place regiments of men to the number of twelve thousand or more, came out to meet us, so that at last we arrived escorted by an army who sang their songs of triumph and played upon their musical instruments until my head ached with the noise.\n\nThis city was a great place whereof the houses were built of mud and thatched with reeds. It stood upon a wide plain and in its centre rose a natural, rocky hill upon the crest of which, fashioned of blocks of gleaming marble and roofed with a metal that shone as gold, was the temple of the Grasshopper, a columned building very like to those of Egypt. Round it also were other public buildings, among them the palace of the Karoon, the whole being surrounded by triple marble walls as a protection from attack by foes. Never had I seen anything so beautiful as that hill with its edifices of shining white roofed with gold or copper and gleaming in the sun.\n\nDescending from my litter I walked to those of my mother and Karema, for Bes in his majesty might not be approached, and said as much to them.\n\n\u201cYes, Son,\u201d answered my mother, \u201cit is worth while to have travelled so far to see such a sight. I shall have a fine sepulchre, Son.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen it all before,\u201d broke in Karema.\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI do not know. I suppose it must have been when I was the Cup of the holy Tanofir. At least it is familiar to me. Already I weary of it, for who can care for a land or a city where they think white people hideous and scarcely allow a wife to go near her husband, save between midnight and dawn when they cease from their horrible music?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be your part to change these customs, Karema.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201ccertainly that will be my part,\u201d after which I went back to my litter.\n\nNow at the gates of the City of the Grasshopper we were royally received. The priests came out to meet us, pushing a colossal image of their god before them on a kind of flat chariot, and I remember wondering what would be the value of that huge golden locust, if it were melted down. Also the Council came, very ancient men all of them, since the Ethiopians for the most part lived more than a hundred years. Perhaps that is why they were so glad to welcome Bes since they were too old to care about retaining power in their own hands as they had done during his long absence. For save Bes there was no other man living of the true royal blood who could take the throne.\n\nThen there were thousands of women, broad-faced and smiling whose black skins shone with scented oils, for they wore little except a girdle about their waists and many ornaments of gold. Thus their earrings were sometimes a palm in breadth and many of them had great gold rings through their noses, such as in Egypt are put in those of bulls. My mother laughed at them, but Karema said that she thought them hideous and hateful.\n\nThey were a strange people, these Ethiopians, like children, most of them, being merry and kind and never thinking of one thing for more than a minute. Thus one would see them weep and laugh almost in the same breath. But among them was an upper class who had great learning and much ancient knowledge. These men made their laws wherein there was always sense under what seemed to be folly, designed the temples, managed the mines of gold and other metals and followed the arts. They were the real masters of the land, the rest were but slaves content to live in plenty, for in that fertile soil want never came near them, and to do as they were bid.\n\nThus they passed from the cradle to the grave amidst song and flowers, carrying out their light, allotted tasks, and for the rest, living as they would and loving those they would, especially their children, of whom they had many. By nature and tradition the men were warriors and hunters, being skilled in the use of the bow and always at war when they could find anyone to fight. Indeed when we came among them their trouble was that they had no enemies left, and at once they implored Bes to lead them out to battle since they were weary of herding kine and tilling fields.",
    "The red rim of Ra appeared glorious in the East, and I, from behind the rocks that I had chosen, sat down and watched. Oh! truly Tanofir or the gods of Egypt were ordering things aright for us. The huge camp was awake now and aware of what was happening on the Nile. They could not see well because of the tall reeds upon the river\u2019s rim and therefore, without order or discipline, by the thousand and the ten thousand, for their numbers were countless, some with arms and some without, they ran to the slope of sand beneath our station and began to climb it to have a better view of the burning ships.\n\nThe sun leapt up swiftly as it does in Egypt. His glowing edge appeared over the crest of the hill though the hollows beneath were still filled with shadow. The moment was at hand. I waited till I had counted ten, glancing to the right and left of me to see that all were ready and to suffer the crowd to thicken on the slope, but not to reach the lowest rocks, whither they were climbing. Then I gave the double signal that had been agreed.\n\nBehind me the banner of the golden Grasshopper was raised upon a tall pole and broke upon the breeze. That was the first signal whereat every man rose to his knees and set shaft on string. Next I lifted my bow, the black bow, the ancient bow that few save I could bend, and drew it to my ear.\n\nFar away, out of arrow-reach as most would have said, floated the Great King\u2019s standard over his pavilion. At this I aimed, making allowance for the wind, and shot. The shaft leapt forward, seen in the sunlight, lost in the shadow, seen in the sunlight again and lastly seen once more, pinning that golden standard against its pole!\n\nAt the sight of the omen a roar went up that rolled to right and left of us, a roar from thirty thousand throats. Now it was lost in a sound like to the hissing of thunder rain in Ethiopia, the sound of thirty thousand arrows rushing through the wind. Oh! they were well aimed, those arrows for I had not taught the Ethiopians archery in vain.\n\nHow many went down before them? The gods of Egypt know alone. I do not. All I know is that the long slope of sand which had been crowded with standing men, was now thick with fallen men, many of whom lay as though they were asleep. For what mail could resist the iron-pointed shafts driven by the strong bows of the Ethiopians?\n\nAnd this was but a beginning, for, flight after flight, those arrows sped till the air grew dark with them. Soon there were no more to shoot at on the slope, for these were down, and the order went to lift the bows and draw upon the camp, and especially upon the parks of baggage beasts. Presently these were down also, or rushing maddened to and fro.\n\nAt last the Eastern generals saw and understood. Orders were shouted and in a mad confusion the scores of thousands who were unharmed, rushed back towards the banks of Nile where our shafts could not reach them. Here they formed up in their companies and took counsel. It was soon ended, for all the vast mass of them, preceded by a cloud of archers, began to advance upon the hill.\n\nNow I passed a command to the Ethiopians, of whom so far not one had fallen, to lie low and wait. On came the glittering multitude of Easterns, gay with purple and gold, their mail and swords shining in the risen sun. On they came by squadron and by company, more than the eye could number. They reached the sand slope thick with their own dead and wounded and paused a little because they could see no man, since the black bodies of the Ethiopians were hid behind the black stones and the black bows did not catch the light.\n\nThen from a gorgeous group that I guessed hid the person of the Great King surrounded by his regiment of guards, ten thousand of them who were called Immortals, messengers sprang forth screaming the order to charge. The host began to climb the slippery sand slope but still I held my hand till their endless lines were within fifty paces of us and their arrows rattled harmlessly against our stones. Then I caused the banner of the Grasshopper that had been lowered, to be lifted thrice, and at the third lifting once more thirty thousand arrows rushed forth to kill.\n\nThey went down, they went down in lines and heaps, riddled through and through. But still others came on for they fought under the eye of the Great King, and to fly meant death with shame and torture. We could not kill them all, they were too many. We could not kill the half of them. Now their foremost were within ten paces of us and since we must stand up to shoot, our men began to fall, also pierced with arrows. I caused the blast of retreat to be sounded on the ivory horn and step by step we drew back to the crest of the ridge, shooting as we went. On the crest we re-formed rapidly in a double line standing as close as we could together and my example was followed all down the ranks to right and left. Then I bethought me of a plan that I had taught these archers again and again in Ethiopia.\n\nWith the flag I signalled a command to stop shooting and also passed the word down the line, so that presently no more arrows flew. The Easterns hesitated, wondering whether this were a trap, or if we lacked shafts, and meanwhile I sent messengers with certain orders to the vanguard, who sped away at speed behind the hill, running as they never ran before. Presently I heard a voice below cry out,\n\n\u201cThe Great King commands that the barbarians be destroyed. Let the barbarians be destroyed!\u201d"

  "Talbot Mundy -- Rung Ho! A Novel": [
    "THAT was no time or place for any girl of twenty to be wandering unprotected. Rosemary McClean knew it; the old woman, of the sweeper caste, that is no caste at all,--the hag with the flat breasts and wrinkled skin, who followed her dogwise, and was no more protection than a toothless dog,--knew it well, and growled about it in incessant undertones that met with neither comment nor response.\n\n\"Leave a pearl of price to glisten on the street, yes!\" she grumbled. \"Perhaps none might notice it--perhaps! But her--here--at this time--\" She would continue in a rumbling growl of half-prophetic catalogues of evil--some that she had seen to happen, some that she imagined, and not any part of which was in the least improbable.\n\nAs the girl passed through the stenching, many-hued bazaar, the roar would cease for a second and then rise again. Turbaned and pugreed--Mohammedan and Hindoo--men of all grades of color, language, and belief, but with only one theory on women, would stare first at the pony that she rode, then at her, and then at the ancient grandmother who trotted in her wake. Low jests would greet the grandmother, and then the trading and the gambling would resume, together with the under-thread of restlessness that was so evidently there and yet so hard to lay a finger on.\n\nThe sun beat down pitilessly--brass--like the din of cymbals. Beneath the sun helmet that sat so squarely and straightforwardly on the tidy chestnut curls, her face was pale. She smiled as she guided her pony in and out amid the roaring throng, and carefully refused to see the scowls, her brave little shoulders seconded a pair of quiet, brave gray eyes in showing an unconquerable courage to the world, and her clean, neat cotton riding-habit gave the lie and the laugh in one to poverty; but, as the crowd had its atmosphere of secret murmuring, she had another of secret anxiety.\n\nNeither had fear. She did not believe in it. She was there to help her father fight inhuman wrong, and die, if need be, in the last ditch. T a two-hundred-million crowd, held down and compelled by less than a hundred thousand aliens. And, least of all, had the man who followed her at a little distance the slightest sense of fear. He was far more conversant with it than she, but--unlike her, and far more than the seething crowd--he knew the trend of events, and just what likelihood there was of insult or injury to Rosemary McClean being avenged in a generation.\n\nHe caused more comment than she, and of a different kind. His rose-pink pugree, with the egret and the diamond brooch to hold the egret in its place--his jeweled sabre--his swaggering, almost ruffianly air--were no more meant to escape attention than his charger that clattered and kicked among the crowd, or his following, who cleared a way for him with the butt ends of their lances. He rode ahead, but every other minute a mounted sepoy would reach out past him and drive his lance-end into the ribs of some one in the way.\n\nThere would follow much deep salaaming; more than one head would bow very low indeed; and in many languages, by the names of many gods, he would be cursed in undertones. Aloud, they would bless him and call him \"Heaven-born!\"\n\nBut he took no interest whatever in the crowd. His dark-brown eyes were fixed incessantly on Rosemary McClean's back. Whenever she turned a corner in the crowded maze of streets, he would spur on in a hurry until she was in sight again, and then his handsome, swarthy face would light with pleasure--wicked pleasure--self-assertive, certain, cruel. He would rein in again to let her draw once more ahead.\n\nRosemary McClean knew quite well who was following her, and knew, too, that she could do nothing to prevent him. Once, as she passed a species of caravansary--low-roofed, divided into many lockable partitions, and packed tight with babbling humanity--she caught sight of a pair of long, black thigh boots, silver-spurred, and of a polished scabbard that moved spasmodically, as though its owner were impatient.\n\n\"Mahommed Gunga!\" she muttered to herself. \"I wonder whether he would come to my assistance if I needed him. He fought once--or so he says--for the British; he might be loyal still. I wonder what he is doing here, and what--Oh, I wonder!\"\n\nShe was very careful not to seem to look sideways, or seek acquaintance with the wearer of the boots; had she done so, she would have gained nothing, for the moment that he caught sight of her through the opened door he drew back into a shadow, and swore lustily. What he said to himself would have been little comfort to her.\n\n\"By the breath of God!\" he growled. \"These preachers of new creeds are the last straw, if one were wanting! They choose the one soft place where Mohammedan and Hindoo think alike, and smite! If I wanted to raise hell from end to end of Hind, I too would preach a new creed, and turn good-looking women loose to wander on the country-side!--Ah!\" He drew back even further, as he spied the egret and the sabre and the stallion cavorting down the street--then thought better of it and strode swaggering to the doorway, and stood, crimson-coated, in the sunlight, stroking upward insolently at his black, fierce-barbered beard. There was a row of medal ribbons on his left breast that bore out something at least of his contention; he had been loyal to the British once, whether he was so now or not.\n\nThe man on the charger eyed him sideways and passed on. Mahommed Gunga waited. One of the prince's followers rode close to him--leaned low from the saddle--and leered into his face.\n\n\"Knowest not enough to salute thy betters?\" he demanded.\n\nMahommed Gunga made a movement with his right hand in the direction of his left hip--one that needed no explanation; the other legged his horse away, and rode on, grinning nastily. To reassure himself of his superiority over everybody but his master, he spun his horse presently so that its rump struck against a tented stall, and upset tent and goods. Then he spent two full minutes in outrageous execration of the men who struggled underneath the gaudy cloth, before cantering away, looking, feeling, riding like a fearless man again. Mahommed Gunga sneered after him, and spat, and turned his back on the sunshine and the street.\n\n\"I had a mind to teach that Hindoo who his betters are!\" he growled.\n\n\"Come in, risaldar-sahib!\" said a voice persuasively. \"By your own showing the hour is not yet--why spill blood before the hour?\"\n\nThe Rajput swaggered to the dark door, spurs jingling, looking back across his shoulder once or twice, as though he half-regretted leaving the Hindoo horseman's head upon his shoulders.\n\n\"Come in, sahib,\" advised the voice again. \"They be many. We are few. And, who knows--our roads may lie together yet.\"\n\nMahommed Gunga kicked his scabbard clear, and strode through the door. The shadows inside and the hum of voices swallowed him as though he were a big, red, black-legged devil reassimilated in the brewing broth of trouble; but his voice boomed deep and loud after he had disappeared from view.\n\n\"When their road and my road lie together, we will travel all feet foremost!\" he asserted.",
    "THEY set the legs of Cunningham's string-woven bed into pans of water, to keep the scorpions and ants and snakes at bay, and then left him in pitch darkness to his own devices, with a parting admonition to keep his slippers on for the floor, in the dark, would be the prowling-place of venomed death.\n\nIt was he who set the lamp on the little table by his bedside, for his servant--for the first time on that journey--was not at hand to execute his thoughts almost before he had spoken them. Mahommed Gunga had explained that the man was sick; and that seemed strange, for he had been well enough, and more than usually efficient, but an hour before.\n\nBut there were stranger things and far more irritating ones to interfere with the peaceful passage of the night. There were sounds that were unaccountable; there was the memory of the wayside tombstone and the train of thought that it engendered. Added to the hell-hot, baking stuffiness that radiated from the walls, there came the squeaking of a punka rope pulled out of time--the piece of piping in the mud-brick wall through which the rope passed had become clogged and rusted, and the villager pressed into service had forgotten how to pull; he jerked at the cord between nods as the heat of the veranda and the unaccustomed night duty combined to make him sleepy.\n\nSoon the squeaking became intolerable, and Cunningham swore at him--in English, because he spoke little of any native language yet, and had not the least idea in any case what the punka-wallah's tongue might be. For a while after that the pulling was more even; he lay on one elbow, letting the swinging mat fan just miss his ear, and examining his rifle and pistols for lack of anything better to keep him from going mad. Then, suddenly, the pulling ceased altogether. Silence and hell heat shut down on him like a coffin lid. Even the lamp flame close beside him seemed to grow dim; the weight of black night that was suffocating him seemed to crush light out of the flame as well.\n\nNo living mortal could endure that, he imagined. He swore aloud, but there was no answer, so he got up, after crashing his rifle-butt down on the floor to scare away anything that crawled. For a moment he stood, undecided whether to take the lamp or rifle with him--then decided on the rifle, for the lamp might blow out in some unexpected night gust, whereas if he left it where it was it would go on burning and show him the way back to bed again. Besides, he was too unaccustomed to the joy of owning the last new thing in sporting rifles to hesitate for long about what to keep within his grasp.\n\nThrough the open door he could see nothing but pitch-blackness, unpunctuated even by a single star. There were no lights where the tents stood, so he judged that even the accustomed natives had found the added heat of Mahommed Gunga's watch-fires intolerable and had raked them out; but from where he imagined that the village must be came the dum-tu-dum-tu-dum of tom-toms, like fever blood pulsating in the veins of devils of the night.\n\nThe punka-wallah slept. He could just make out the man's blurred shape--a shadow in the shadows--dog-curled, with the punkah rope looped round his foot. He kicked him gently, and the man stirred, but fell asleep again. He kicked him harder. The man sat up and stared, terrified; the whites of his eyes were distinctly visible. He seemed to have forgotten why he was there, and to imagine that he saw a ghost.\n\nCunningham spoke to him--he first words that came into his head.\n\n\"Go on pulling,\" he said in English, quite kindly.\n\nBut if he had loosed his rifle off, the effect could not have been more instantaneous. Clutching his twisted rag of a turban in one hand, and kicking his leg free, he ran for it--leaped the veranda rail, and vanished--a night shadow, swallowed by its mother night.\n\n\"Come back!\" called Cunningham. \"Iderao! I won't hurt you!\"\n\nBut there was no answer, save the tom-toms' thunder, swelling now into a devil's chorus-coming nearer. It seemed to be coming from the forest, but he reasoned that it could not be; it must be some village marriage feast, or perhaps an orgy; he had paid out what would seem to the villagers a lot of money, and it might be that they were celebrating the occasion. It was strange, though, that he could see no lights where the village ought to be.\n\nFor a moment he had a half-formed intention to shout for Mahommed Gunga; but he checked that, reasoning that the Rajput might think he was afraid. Then his eye caught sight of something blacker than the shadows--something long and thin and creepy that moved, and he remembered that bed, where the pans of water would protect him, was the only safe place.\n\nSo he returned into the hot, black silence where the tiny lamp-flame guttered and threw shadows. He wondered why it guttered. It seemed to be actually short of air. There were four rooms, he remembered, to the bungalow, all connected and each opening outward by a door that faced one of the four sides; he wondered whether the outer doors were opened to admit a draught, and started to investigate.\n\nTwo of them were shut tight, and he could not kick them open; the dried-out teak and the heavy iron bolts held as though they had been built to resist a siege; the noise that he made as he rattled at them frightened a swarm of unseen things--unguessed-at shapes--that scurried away. He thought he could see beady little eyes that looked and disappeared and circled round and stopped to look again. He could hear creepy movements in the stillness. It seemed better to leave those doors alone.\n\nOne other door, which faced that of his own room, was open wide, and he could feel the forest through it; there was nothing to be seen, but the stillness moved. The velvet blackness was deeper by a shade, and the heat, uprising to get even with the sky, bore up a stench with it. There was no draught, no movement except upward. Earth was panting-in time, it seemed, to the hellish thunder of the tom-toms.\n\nHe went back and lay on the bed again, leaning the rifle against the cot-frame, and trying by sheer will-power to prevent the blood from bursting his veins. He realized before long that he was parched with thirst, and reached out for the water-jar that stood beside the lamp; but as he started to drink he realized that a crawling evil was swimming round and round in rings in the water. In a fit of horror he threw the thing away and smashed it into a dozen fragments in a corner. He saw a dozen rats, at least, scamper to drink before the water could evaporate or filter through the floor; and when they were gone there was no half-drowned crawling thing either. They had eaten it.\n\nHe clutched his rifle to him. The barrel was hot, but the feel of it gave him a sense of companionship. And then, as he lay back on the bed again, the lamp went out. He groped for it and shook it. There was no oil.\n\nNow, what had been hot horror turned to fear that passed all understanding--to the hate that does not reason--to the cold sweat breaking on the roasted skin. Where the four walls had been there was blackness of immeasurable space. He could hear the thousand-footed cannibals of night creep nearer--driven in toward him by the dinning of the tom-toms. He felt that his bed was up above a scrambling swarm of black-legged things that fought.\n\nHe had no idea how long he lay stock-still, for fear of calling attention to himself, and hated his servant and Mahommed Gunga and all India. Once--twice--he thought he heard another sound, almost like the footfall of a man on the veranda near him. Once he thought that a man breathed within ten paces of him, and for a moment there was a distinct sensation of not being alone. He hoped it was true; he could deal with an assassin. That would be something tangible to hate and hit. Manhood came to his assistance--the spirit of the soldier that will bow to nothing that has shape; but it died away again as the creeping silence once more shut down on him.\n\nAnd then the thunder of the tom-toms ceased. Then even the venomed crawlers that he knew were near him faded into nothing that really mattered, compared to the greater, stealthy horror that he knew was coming, born of the shuddersome, shut silence that ensued. There was neither air nor view--no sense of time or space--nothing but the coal-black pit of terror yawning--cold sweat in the heat, and a footfall--an undoubted footfall--followed by another one, too heavy for a man's.\n\nWhere heavy feet were there was something tangible. His veins tingled and the cold sweat dried. Excitement began to reawaken all his soldier senses, and the wish to challenge seized him--the soldierly intent to warn the unaware, which is the actual opposite of cowardice.\n\n\"Halt! Who comes there?\"\n\nHe lipped the words, but his dry throat would not voice them. Before he could clear his throat or wet his lips his eye caught something lighter than the night--two things--ten--twelve paces off--two things that glowed or sheened as though there were light inside them--too big and too far apart to be owl's eyes, but singularly like them. They moved, a little sideways and toward him; and again he heard the heavy, stealthy footfall.\n\nThey stayed still then for what may have been a minute, and another sense--smell--warned him and stirred up the man in him. He had never smelled it in his life; it must have been instinct that assured him of an enemy behind the strange, unpleasant, rather musky reek that filled the room. His right hand brought the rifle to his shoulder without sound, and almost without conscious effort on his part.\n\nHe forgot the heat now and the silence and discomfort. He lay still on his side, squinting down the rifle barrel at a spot he judged was midway between a pair of eyes that glowed, and wondering where his foresight might be. It struck him all at once that it was quite impossible to see the foresight--that he must actually touch what he would hit if he would be at all sure of hitting it. He remembered, too, in that instant--as a born soldier does remember things--that in the dark an attacking enemy is probably more frightened than his foe. His father had told it him when he was a little lad afraid of bogies; he in turn had told it to the other boys at school, and they had passed it on until in that school it had become rule number one of school-boy lore--just as rule number two in all schools where the sons of soldiers go is \"Take the fight to him.\"\n\nHe leaped from the bed, with his rifle out in front of him--white-nightshirted and unexpected--sudden enough to scare the wits out of anything that had them. He was met by a snarl. The two eyes narrowed, and then blazed. They lowered, as though their owner gathered up his weight to spring. He fired between them. The flash and the smoke blinded him; the burst of the discharge within four echoing walls deadened his cars, and he was aware of nothing but a voice beside him that said quietly: \"Well done, bahadur! Thou art thy father's son!\"\n\nHe dropped his rifle butt to the floor, and some one struck a light. Even then it was thirty seconds before his strained eyes grew accustomed to the flare and he could see the tiger at his feet, less than a yard away--dead, bleeding, wide-eyed, obviously taken by surprise and shot as he prepared to spring. Beside him, within a yard, Mahommed Gunga stood, with a drawn sabre in his right hand and a pistol in his left, and there were three other men standing like statues by the walls.\n\n\"How long have you been here?\" demanded Cunningham.\n\n\"A half-hour, sahib.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"In case of need, sahib. That tiger killed a woman yesterday at dawn and was driven off his kill; he was not likely to be an easy mark for an untried hunter.\"\n\n\"Why did you enter without knocking?\"\n\nThe ex-risaldar said nothing.\n\n\"I see that you have shoes on.\"\n\n\"The scorpions, sahib--\"\n\n\"Would you be pleased, Mahommed Gunga, if I entered your house with my hat on and without knocking or without permission?\"\n\n\"Sahib, I--\"\n\n\"Be good enough to have that brute's carcass dragged out and skinned, and--ah--leave me to sleep, will you?\"\n\nMahommed Gunga bowed, and growled an order; another man passed the order on, and the tom-tom thundering began again as a dozen villagers pattered in to take away the tiger.\n\n\"Tell them, please,\" commanded Cunningham, \"that that racket is to cease. I want to sleep.\"\n\nAgain Mahommed Gunga bowed, without a smile or a tremor on his face; again a growled order was echoed and re-echoed through the dark. The drumming stopped.\n\n\"Is there oil in the bahadur's lamp?\" asked Mahommed Gunga.\n\n\"Probably not,\" said Cunningham.\n\n\"I will command that--\"\n\n\"You needn't trouble, thank you, risaldar-sahib. I sleep better in the dark. I'll be glad to see you after breakfast as usual--ah--without your shoes, unless you come in uniform. Good night.\"",
    "The dawn was barely breaking yet when things stirred in the little mission house. The flea-bitten gray pony was saddled by a sleepy saice, and brought round from his open-sided thatch stable in the rear. The violet and mauve, that precede the aching yellow glare of day were fading; a coppersmith began his everlasting bong-bong-bong, apparently reverberating from every direction; the last, almost indetectable, warm whiff of night wind moved and died away, and the monkeys in the near-by baobab chattered it a requiem. Almost on the stroke of sunrise Rosemary McClean stepped out--settled her sun-helmet, with a moue above the chin-strap that was wasted on flat-bosomed, black grandmotherdom and sulky groom--and mounted.\n\nShe needed no help. The pony stood as though he knew that the hot wind would soon dry the life out of him; and, though dark rings beneath dark eyes betrayed the work of heat and sleepless worry on a girl who should have graced the cool, sweet, rain-swept hills of Scotland, she had spirit left yet and an unspent store of youth. The saice seemed more weathered than the twenty-year-old girl, for he limped back into the smelly shelter of the servants' quarters to cook his breakfast and mumble about dogs and sahibs who prefer the sun.\n\nShe looked shrunk inside the riding-habit--not shrivelled, for she sat too straight, but as though the cotton jacket had been made for a larger woman. If she seemed tired, and if a stranger might have guessed that her head ached until the chestnut curls were too heavy for it, she was still supple. And, as she whipped the pony into an unwilling trot and old mission-named Joanna broke into a jog behind, revolt--no longer impatience, or discontent, or sorrow, but reckless rebellion--rode with her.\n\nIt was there, plain for the world to see, in the firm lines of a little Puritan mouth, in the angle of a high-held chin in the set of a gallant little pair of shoulders. The pony felt it, and leaned forward to a canter. Joanna scented, smelt, or sensed in some manner known to Eastern old age, that purpose was afoot; this was to be no early-morning canter, merely out and home again; there was no time, now, for the customary tricks of corner-cutting and rest-snatching under eaves; she tucked her head down and jogged forward in the dust, more like a dog than ever. It was a dog's silent, striving determination to be there when the finish came--a dog's disregard of all object or objective but his master's--but a long-thrown stride, and a crafty, beady eye that promised more usefulness than a dog's when called on.\n\nThe first word spoken was when Rosemary drew rein a little more than half-way along the palace wall.\n\n\"Are you tired yet, Joanna?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh!\" the woman answered, shaking her head violently and pointing at the sun that mounted every minute higher. The argument was obvious; in less than twenty minutes the whole horizon would be shimmering again like shaken plates of brass; wherever the other end might be, a rest would be better there than here! Her mistress nodded, and rode on again, faster yet; she had learned long ago that Joanna could show a dusty pair of heels to almost anything that ran, and she had never yet known distance tire her; it had been the thought of distance and speed combined that made her pause and ask.\n\nShe did not stop again until they had cantered up through the awakening bazaar, where unclean-looking merchants and their underlings rinsed out their teeth noisily above the gutters, and the pariah dogs had started nosing in among the muck for things unthinkable to eat. The sun had shortened up the shadows and begun to beat down through the gaps; the advance-guard of the shrivelling hot wind had raised foul dust eddies, and the city was ahum when she halted at last beside the big brick arch of the caravansary, where Mahommed Gunga's boots and spurs had caught her eye once.\n\n\"Now, Joanna!\" She leaned back from the saddle and spoke low, but with a certain thrill. \"Go in there, find me Mahommed Gunga-sahib's man, and bring him out here!\"\n\n\"And if he will not come?\" The old woman seemed half-afraid to enter.\n\n\"Go in, and don't come out without him--unless you want to see me go in by myself!\"\n\nThe old woman looked at her piercingly with eyes that gleamed from amid a bunch of wrinkles, then motioned with a skinny arm in the direction of an awning where shade was to be had from the dangerous early sun-rays. She made no move to enter through the arch until her mistress had taken shelter.\n\nFifteen minutes later she emerged with Ali Partab, who looked sleepy, but still more ashamed of his unmilitary dishabille. Rosemary McClean glanced left and right--forgot about the awning and the custom which decrees aloofness--ignored the old woman's waving arm and Ali Partab's frown, and rode toward him eagerly.\n\n\"Did Mahommed Gunga-sahib leave you here with any orders relative to me?\" she asked.\n\nThe Rajput bowed.\n\n\"Before he went away, he spoke to me of safety, and told me he would leave a link between me and men whom I may trust.\"\n\nThe Rajput bowed again. Neither of them saw an elbow laid on the window-ledge of a room above the arch; it disappeared, and very gingerly a bared black head replaced it. Then the head too disappeared.\n\nThe girl's eyes sparkled as the reassurance came that at least one good fighting man was waiting to do nothing but assist her. For the moment she threw caution to the winds and remembered nothing but her plight and her father's stubbornness.\n\n\"My father will not come away, but--\"\n\nAli Partab's eyes betrayed no trace of concern.\n\n\"But--I thought--Are you all alone?\"\n\n\"All alone, Miss-sahib, but your servant.\"\n\n\"Oh! I thought--perhaps that\"--she checked herself, then rushed the words out as though ashamed of them--\"that, if you had men to help you, you might carry him away against his will! Where are these others who are to be trusted?\"\n\nAli Partab grinned and then drew himself up with a movement of polite dissent. It was not for him to question the suggestions of a Miss-sahib; he conveyed that much with an inimitable air. But it was his business to keep strictly to the letter of his orders.\n\n\"Miss-sahib, I cannot do that. So said Mahommed Gunga: 'When the hag brings word, then take three horses and bear the Miss-sahib and her father to my cousin Alwa's place.' I stand ready to obey, but the padre-sahib comes not against his will.\"\n\n\"To whose place?\"\n\n\"Alwa's, Miss-sahib.\"\n\n\"And who is he?\" She seemed bewildered. \"I had hoped to be escorted to some British residency.\"\n\n\"That would be for Alwa, should he see fit. He has men and horses, and a fort that is impregnable. The Miss-sahib would be safe there under all circumstances.\"\n\n\"But--but, supposing I declined to accept that invitation? Supposing I preferred not to be carried off to a--er--a Mohammedan gentleman's fort. What then?\"\n\n\"I could but wait here, Miss-sahib, until the hour came when you changed your mind, or until Mahommed Gunga by letter or by word of mouth relieved me of my trust.\"\n\n\"Oh! Then you will wait here until I ask?\"\n\n\"Surely, Miss-sahib.\"\n\nThe head again peered through the window up above them, but disappeared below the ledge furtively, and none of the three were aware of it. For that matter, the old woman was gazing intently at Ali Partab and listening eagerly; he stood almost underneath the arch, and Miss McClean was staring at him frowning with the effort to translate her thoughts into a language that is very far from easy. They would none of them have seen the roof descending on them.\n\n\"And--and won't you under any circumstances take us, say, to the Resident at Abu instead?\"\n\n\"I may not, Miss-sahib.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Of a truth I know not. I never yet knew Mahommed Gunga to give an order without good reason for it; but beyond that he chose me, because he said the task might prove difficult and he trusted me, I know nothing.\"\n\n\"Have you no idea of the reason?\"\n\n\"Miss-sahib, I am a soldier. To me an order is an order to be carried out; suspicions, fears are nothing unless they stand in the way of accomplishment. I await your word. I am ready. The horses are here--good horses--lean and hard. The order is that you must ask me.\"\n\n\"Thank you--er--Ali what?--thank you, Ali Partab.\" The disappointment in her voice was scarcely more noticeable than the despondency her drooping figure showed. The little shoulders that had sat so square and gallantly seemed to have lost their strength, and there was none of the determined ring left in the words she hesitated for. \"I--hope you will understand that I am grateful--but--I cannot--er--see my way just yet to--\"\n\n\"In your good time, Miss-sahib. I was ordered to have patience!\"\n\n\"At least I will have more confidence, knowing that you are always close at hand.\"",
    "ON the morning after Mahommed Gunga's daring experiment with Cunningham's nervous system he was anxious to say the least of it; and that is only another way of saying that he was irritable. He watched the Englishman at breakfast, on the dak-bungalow veranda, with a sideways restless glance that gave the lie a dozen times over to his assumed air of irascible authority.\n\n\"We will see now what we will see,\" he muttered to himself. \"These who know such a lot imagine that the test is made. They forget that there be many brave men of whom but a few are fit to lead. Now--now--we will see!\" And he kept on repeating that assurance to himself, with the air of a man who would like to be assured, but is not, while he ostentatiously found fault with every single thing on which his eyes lit.\n\n\"One would think that the Risaldar-sahib were afraid of consequences!\" whispered the youngest of his followers, stung to the quick by a quite unmerited rebuke. \"Does he fear that Chota-Cunnigan will beat him?\"\n\nWhite men have been known--often--to do stupider things than that, and particularly young white men who have not yet learned to gauge proportions accurately; so there was nothing really ridiculous in the suggestion. A young white man who has had his temper worked up to the boiling-point, his nerves deliberately racked, and then has been subjected to the visit of a driven tiger, may be confidently expected to exhibit all the faults of which his character is capable.\n\nTo make the situation even more ticklish, Cunningham's servant, in his zeal for his master's comfort, had forgotten to sham sickness, and instead of limping was in abominably active evidence. He was even doing more than was expected of him. Ralph Cunningham had said nothing to him--had not needed to; every single thing that a pampered sahib could imagine that he needed was done for him in the proper order, without noise or awkwardness, and the Risaldar cursed as he watched the clockwork-perfect service. He had hoped for a lapse that might call forth some pointer, either by way of irritation or amusement, as to how young Cunningham was taking things.\n\nBut not a thing went wrong and not a sign of any sort gave Cunningham. The youngster did not smile either to himself darkly or at his servant. He lit his after-breakfast cigar and smoked it peacefully, as though he had spent an absolutely normal night, without even a dream to worry him, and if he eyed Mahommed Gunga at all, he did it so naturally, and with so little interest, that no deductions could be drawn from it. He was neither more nor less than a sahib at his ease--which was disconcerting, very, to the Oriental mind.\n\nHe smoked the cigar to a finish, without a word or sign that he wished to give audience. Then his eyes lit for the first time on the tiger-skin that was pegged out tight, raw side upward, for the sun to sterilize; he threw the butt of his cigar away and strolled out to examine the skin without a sign to Mahommed Gunga, counted the claws one by one to make sure that no superstitious native had purloined any of them, and returned to his chair on the veranda without a word.\n\n\"Is he vindictive, then?\" wondered Mahommed Gunga. \"Is he a mean man? Will he bear malice and get even with me later on? If so--\"\n\n\"Present my compliments to Mahommed Gunga-sahib, and ask him to be good enough to--\"\n\nThe Risaldar heard the order, and was on his way to the veranda before the servant started to convey the message. He took no chances on a reprimand about his shoes, for he swaggered up in riding-boots, which no soldier can be asked to take off before he treads on a private floor; and he saluted as a soldier, all dignity. It was the only way by which he could be sure to keep the muscles of his face from telling tales.\n\n\"Huzoor?\"\n\n\"Morning, Mahommed Gunga. Take a seat, won't you?\"\n\nA camp-chair creaked under the descending Rajput's weight, and creaked again as he remembered to settle himself less stiffly--less guiltily.\n\n\"I say, I'm going to ask you chaps to do me a favor. You don't mind obliging me now and then, do you?\"\n\nThe youngster leaned forward confidentially, one elbow on his knee, and looked half-serious, as though what he had to ask were more important than the ordinary.\n\n\"Sahib, there is nothing that we will not do.\"\n\n\"Ah! Then you won't mind my mentioning this, I'm sure. Next time you want to kennel a tiger in my bedroom, d'you mind giving me notice in advance? It's not the stink I mind, nor being waked up; it's the deuced awful risk of hurting somebody. Besides--look how I spoilt that tiger's mask! The skins I've always admired at home had been shot where it didn't show so badly.\"\n\nThere was not even the symptom of a smile on Cunningham's face. He looked straight into Mahommed Gunga's eyes, and spoke as one man talking calm common sense to another. He raised his hand as the Rajput began to stammer an apology.\n\n\"No. Don't apologize. If you'll forgive me for shooting your pet tiger, I'll overlook the rest of it. If I'd known that you kept him in there o' nights, I'd have chosen another room, that's all--some room where I couldn't smell him, and where I shouldn't run the risk of killing an inoffensive man. Why, I might have shot you! Think how sorry I'd have been!\"\n\nThe Risaldar did not quite know what to say; so, wiser than most, he said nothing.\n\n\"Oh, and one other matter. I don't speak much of the language yet, so, would you mind translating to my servant that the next time he goes sick without giving me notice, and without putting oil in my lamp, I'll have him fed to the tiger before he's brought into my room? Just tell him that quietly, will you? Say it slowly so that it sinks in. Thanks.\"\n\nStraight-faced as Cunningham himself, the Risaldar tongue-lashed the servant with harsh, tooth-rasping words that brought him up to attention. Whether he interpreted or not the exact meaning of what Cunningham had said, he at least produced the desired effect; the servant mumbled apologetic nothings and slunk off the veranda backward--to go away and hold his sides with laughter at the back of the dak-bungalow. There Mahommed Gunga found him afterward and administered a thrashing--not, as he was careful to explain, for disobedience, but for having dared to be amused at the Risaldar's discomfiture.",
    "RALPH CUNNINGHAM reached Peshawur at last with no less than nine tigers to his gun, and that in itself would have been sufficient to damn him in the eyes of more than half of the men who held commands there. Jealousy in those days of slow promotion and intrenched influence had eaten into the very understanding of men whose only excuse for rule over a conquered people ought to have been understanding.\n\nIt was not considered decent for a boy of twenty-one to do much more than dare to be alive. For any man at all to offer advice or information to his senior was rank presumption. Criticism was high treason. Sport, such as tiger-shooting, was for those whose age and apoplectic temper rendered them least fitted for it. Conservatism reigned: \"High Toryism, sir, old port, and proud Prerogative!\"\n\nMahommed Gunga grinned into his beard at the reception that awaited the youngster whom he had trained for months now in the belief that India had nothing much to do except reverence him. He laughed aloud, when he could get away to do it, at the flush of indignation on his protege's face. Tall, lean-limbed, full of health and spirits, he had paid his duty call on a General of Division; with the boyish enthusiasm that says so plainly, \"Laugh with me, for the world is mine!\" he had boasted his good luck on the road, only to be snubbed thoroughly and told that tiger-shooting was not what he came for.\n\nHe took the snub like a man and made no complaint to anybody; he did not even mention it to the other subalterns, who, most of them, made no secret of their dissatisfaction and its hundred causes. He listened, and it was not very long before it dawned on him that, had not Mahommed Gunga gone with him to pay a call as well, the General Division would not have so much as interviewed him.\n\nMahommed Gunga soon became the bane of his existence. The veteran seemed in no hurry to go back to his estate that must have been in serious need of management by this time, but would ride off on mysterious errands and return with a dozen or more black-bearded horsemen each time. He would introduce them to Cunningham in public whenever possible under the eyes of outraged seniors who would swear and fume and ride away disgust at the reverence paid to \"a mere boy, sir--a bally, ignorant young jackanapes!\"\n\nHad Cunningham been other than a born soldier with his soldier senses all on edge and sleepless, he would have fallen foul of disgrace within a month. He was unattached as yet, and that fact gave opportunity to the men who looked for it to try to \"take the conceit out of the cub, by gad.\"\n\n\"They \"--everybody spoke of them as \"they\"--conceived the brilliant idea of confronting the youngster with conditions which he lacked experience to cope with. They set him to deal with circumstances which had long ago proved too difficult for themselves, and awaited confidently the outcome--the crass mistake, or oversight, or mere misfortune that, with the aid of a possible court martial, would reduce him to a proper state of humbleness.\n\nPeshawur, the greatest garrison in northern India, was there on sufferance, apparently. For lack of energetic men in authority to deal with them, the border robbers plundered while the troops remained cooped up within the unhealthiest station on the list. The government itself, with several thousand troops to back it up, was paying blackmail to the border thieves! There was not a government bungalow in all Peshawur that did not have its \"watchman,\" hired from over the border, well paid to sleep on the veranda lest his friends should come and take tribute in an even more unseemly manner.\n\nThe younger men, whose sense of fitness had not yet been rotted by climate and system and prerogative, swore at the condition; there were one or two men higher up, destined to make history, whose voices, raised in emphatic protest, were drowned in the drone of \"Peace! Peace is the thing to work for. Compromise, consideration, courtesy, these three are the keys of rule.\" They failed to realize that cowardice was their real keynote, and that the threefold method that they vaunted was quite useless without a stiffening of courage.\n\nSo brave men, who had more courtesy in each of their fingers than most of the seniors had all put together, had to bow to a scandalous condition that made England's rule a laughing-stock within a stone's throw of the city limits. And they had to submit to the indecency of seeing a new, inexperienced arrival picked for the task of commanding a body of irregulars, for no other reason than because it was considered wise to make an exhibition of him.\n\nCunningham became half policeman, half soldier, in charge of a small special force of mounted men engaged for the purpose of patrol. He had nothing to do with the selection of them; that business was attended to perfunctorily by a man very high up in departmental service, who considered Cunningham a nuisance. He was a gentleman who did not know Mahommed Gunga; another thing he did not know was the comfortable feel of work well done; so he was more than pleased when Mahommed Gunga dropped in from nowhere in particular--paid him scandalously untrue compliments without a blush or a smile and offered to produce the required number of men at once.\n\nOnly fifty were required. Mahommed Gunga brought three hundred to select from, and, when asked to do so in order to save time and trouble, picked out the fifty best.",
    "NOW it may seem unimaginable that two Europeans could be cooped in Howrah, not under physical restraint, and yet not able to communicate with any one who could render them assistance. It was the case, though, and not by any means an isolated case. The policy of the British Government, once established in India, was and always has been not to occupy an inch of extra territory until compelled by circumstances.\n\nThe native states, then, while forbidden to contract alliances with one another or the world outside, and obliged by the letter of written treaties to observe certain fundamental laws imposed on them by the Anglo-Indian Government, were left at liberty to govern themselves. And it was largely the fact that they could and did keep secret what was going on within their borders that enabled the so-called Sepoy Rebellion to get such a smouldering foothold before it burst into a blaze. The sepoys were the tools of the men behind the movement; and the men behind were priests and others who were feeling nothing but their own ambition.\n\nNo man knows even now how long the fire rebellion had been burning underground before showed through the surface; but it is quite obvious that, in spite of the heroism shown by British and loyal native alike when the crash did come, the rebels must have won--and have won easily sheer weight of numbers--had they only used the amazing system solely for the broad, comprehensive purpose for which it was devised.\n\nBut the sense of power that its ramifications and extent gave birth to also whetted the desires individuals. Each man of any influence at all began to scheme to use the system for the furtherance of his individual ambition. Instead of bending all their energy and craft to the one great object of hurling an unloved conqueror back whence he came, each reigning prince strove to scheme himself head and shoulders above the rest; and each man who wanted to be prince began to plot harder than ever to be one.\n\nSo in Howrah the Maharajah's brother, Jaimihr, with a large following and organization of his own, began to use the secret system of which he by right formed an integral part and to set wheels working within the wheels which in course of time should spew him up on the ledge which his brother now occupied. Long before the rebellion was ready he had all his preparations made and waited only for the general conflagration to strike for his own hand. And was so certain of success that he dared make plans as well for Rosemary McClean's fate.\n\nThere is a blindness, too, quite unexplainable that comes over whole nations sometimes. It is almost like a plague in its mysterious arrival and departure. As before the French Revolution there were almost none of the ruling classes who could read the writing on the wall, so it was in India in the spring of '57. Men saw the signs and could not read their meaning. As in France, so in India, there were a few who understood, but they were scoffed at; the rest--the vast majority who held the reins of power--were blind.\n\nRosemary McClean discovered that her pony had gone lame, and was angry with the groom. The groom ran away, and she put that down to native senselessness. Duncan McClean sent one after another of the little native children to find him a man who would take a letter to Mount Abu. The children went and did not come back again, and he put that down to the devil, who would seem to have reclaimed them.\n\nBoth of them saw the watchers, posted at every vantage-point, insolently wakeful; both of them knew that Jaimihr had placed them there. But neither of them looked one inch deeper than the surface, nor supposed that their presence betokened anything but the prince's unreachable ambition. Neither of them thought for an instant that the day could possibly have come when Britain would be unable to protect a woman of its own race, or when a native--however powerful--would dare to do more than threaten.\n\nJoanna disappeared, and that led to a chain of thought which was not creditable to any one concerned. They reasoned this way: Rosemary had seen Mahommed Gunga hold out a handful of gold coins for the old woman's eyes to glitter at, therefore it was fair to presume that he had promised her a reward for bringing word to the man whom, it was now known, he had left behind. She had brought word to him and had disappeared. What more obvious than to reason that the man had gladly paid her, and had just as gladly ridden off, rejoicing at the thought that he could escape doing service?\n\n\"So much,\" they argued, \"for native constancy! So much for Mahommed Gunga's boast that he knew of men who could be trusted! And so much for Joanna's gratitude!\"\n\nThe old woman had been saved by Rosemary McClean from the long-drawn-out hell that is the life portion of most Indian widows, even of low caste; she had had little to do, ever, beyond snooze in the shade and eat, and run sometimes behind the pony--a task which came as easily to her as did the other less active parts of her employment. Her desertion, particularly at a crisis, made Rosemary McClean cry, and set her father to quoting Shakespeare's \"King Lear.\"\n\n   \"Blow, blow, thou winter wind!\n    Thou art not so unkind\n    As man's ingratitude!\"\n\nAll Scotsmen seem to have a natural proclivity for quoting the appropriate dirge when sorrow shows itself. The Book of Lamentations--Shakespeare's sadder lines--roll off their tongues majestically and seem to give them consolation--as it were to lay a sound, unjoyous basis for the proper enjoyment of the songs of Robbie Burns.\n\nThe poor old king of the poet's imagining, declaiming up above the cliffs of Dover, could have put no more pathos into those immortal lines than did Duncan McClean as he paced up and down between the hot wars of the darkened room. The dry air parched his throat, and his ambition seemed to shrivel in him as he saw the brave little woman who was all he had sobbing with her head between her hands.",
    "They lit through the deserted street, troubling for speed, not silence; the few whom they passed had no time to determine who they were, and no one followed them. A few frightened night-wanderers ran at sight of them, hiding down side streets, but when they brought up at last outside Jaimihr's palace-gate they had so far escaped recognition. And that meant that no one would carry word to Jaimihr or his men.\n\nIt was death-dark outside the bronze-hinged double gate; only a dim lamp hung above from chains, to show how dark it was, and the moon--cut off by trees and houses on a bluff of rising ground--lent nothing to the gloom.\n\n\"Open! The jaimihr-sahib comes!\" shouted Alwa and one of his horsemen legged up close beside the gate.\n\nSome one moved inside, for his footsteps could be heard; whoever he was appeared to listen cautiously.\n\n\"Open for the Jaimihr-sahib!\" repeated Alwa.\n\nEvidently that was not the usual command, or otherwise the gates would have swung open on the instant. Instead, one gate moved inward by a fraction of a foot, and a pureed head peered cautiously between the gap. That, though, was sufficient. With a laugh, the man up closest drove his sword-hilt straight between the Hindoo's eyes, driving his horse's shoulder up against the gate; three others spurred and shoved beside him. Not thirty seconds later Alwa and his nine were striking hoof sparks on the stone of Jaimihr's courtyard, and the gates--that could have easily withstood a hundred-man assault with battering-rams--had clanged behind them, bolted tight against their owner.\n\n\"Where is the bear cage?\" demanded Alwa. \"It is a bear I need, not blood!\"\n\nThe dozen left inside to guard the palace had recovered quickly enough from their panic. They were lining up in the middle of the courtyard, ready to defend their honor, even if the palace should be lost. It was barely probable that Jaimihr's temper would permit them the privilege of dying quickly should he come and find his palace looted; a Rangar's sword seemed better, and they made ready to die hard.\n\n\"Where's Ali Partab?\"\n\nThere was no answer. The little crowd drew in, and one by one took up the fighting attitude that each man liked the best.\n\n\"I say I did not come for blood! I came for Ali Partab! If I get him, unharmed, I ride away again; but otherwise--\"\n\n\"What otherwise?\" asked the captain of the guard.\n\n\"This palace burns!\"\n\nThere was a momentary consultation--no argument, but a quickly reached agreement.\n\n\"He is here, unharmed,\" declared the captain gruffly.\n\n\"Bring him out!\"\n\n\"What proof have we that he is all you came for?\"\n\n\"My given word.\"\n\n\"But the Jaimihr-sahib--\"\n\n\"You also have my given word that unless I get Ali Partab this palace burns, with all that there is in it!\"\n\nDistrustful still, the captain of the guard called out to a sweeper, skulking in the shadow by the stables to go and loose Ali Partab.\n\n\"Send no sweepers to him!\" ordered Alwa. \"He has suffered indignity enough. Go thou!\"\n\nThe captain of the guard obeyed. Two minutes later Ali Partab stood before Alwa and saluted.\n\n\"Sahib, my master's thanks!\"\n\n\"They are accepted,\" answered Alwa, with almost regal dignity. \"Bring a lamp!\" he ordered.\n\nOne of the guard brought a hand-lantern, and by its light Alwa examined Ali Partab closely. He was filthy, and his clothing reeked of the disgusting confinement he had endured.\n\n\"Give this man clothing fit for a man of mine!\" commanded Alwa.\n\n\"Sahib, there is none; perhaps the Jaimihr-sahib--\"\n\n\"I have ordered!\"\n\nThere was a movement among Alwa's men--a concerted, horse-length-forward movement, made terrifying by the darkness--each man knew well enough that the men they were bullying could fight; success, should they have to force it at the sword-point, would depend largely on which side took the other by surprise.\n\n\"It is done, sahib,\" said the leader of the guard, and one man hurried off to execute the order. Ten minutes later--they were ten impatient minutes, during which the horses sensed the fever of anxiety and could be hardly made to stand--Ali Partab stood arrayed in clean, new khaki that fitted him reasonably well.\n\n\"A sword, now!\" demanded Alwa. \"Thy sword! This man had a sword when he was taken! Give him thine, unless there is a better to be had.\"\n\nThere was nothing for it but obedience, for few things were more certain than that Alwa was not there to waste time asking for anything he would not fight for if refused. The guard held out his long sword, hilt first, and Ali Partab strapped it on.\n\n\"I had three horses when they took me,\" he asserted, \"three good ones, sound and swift, belonging to my master.\"\n\n\"Then take three of Jaimihr's!\"\n\nIt took ten minutes more for Ali Partab and two of Alwa's men to search the stables and bring out the three best chargers of the twenty and more reserved for Jaimihr's private use. They were wonders of horses, half-Arab and half-native-bred, clean-limbed and firm--worth more, each one of them, than all three of Mahommed Gunga's put together.\n\n\"Are they good enough?\" demanded Alwa.\n\n\"My master will be satisfied,\" grinned Ali Partab.",
    "Within ten minutes he was seated in his throne-room. One minute later his prisoners stood in front of him, still holding each other's hands, and the guard withdrew. The great doors opening on the marble outer hall clanged tight, and in this room there were no carved screens through which a hidden, rustling world might listen. There was gold-incrusted splendor--there were glittering, hanging ornaments that far outdid the peacocks' feathers of the canopy above the throne; but the walls were solid, and the marble floor rang hard and true.\n\nThere was no nook or corner anywhere that could conceal a man. For a minute, still bejewelled in his robes of state and glittering as the diamonds in his head-dress caught the light from half a dozen hanging lamps, the Maharajah sat and gazed at them, his chin resting on one hand and his silk-clad elbow laid on the carved gold arm of his throne.\n\n\"Why am I troubled?\" he demanded suddenly.\n\n\"You know!\" said the missionary. His daughter clutched his hand tightly, partly to reassure him, partly because she knew that a despot would be bearded now in his gold-bespattered den, and fear gripped her.\n\n\"Maharajah-sahib, when I came here with letters from the government of India and asked you for a mission house in which to live and work, I told you that I came as a friend--as a respectful sympathizer. I told you I would not incite rebellion against you, and that I would not interfere with native custom or your authority so long as acquiescence and obedience by me did not run counter to the overriding law of the British Government.\"\n\nHowrah did not even move his head in token that he listened, but his tired eyes answered.\n\n\"To that extent I promised not to interfere with your religion.\"\n\nHowrah nodded.\n\n\"Once--twice--in all nine times--I came and warned you that the practice of suttee was and is illegal. My knowledge of Sanskrit is only slight, but there are others of my race who have had opportunity to translate the Sanskrit Vedas, and I have in writing what they found in them. I warned you, when that information reached me, that your priests have been deliberately lying to you--that the Vedas say: 'Thrice-blessed is she who dies of a broken heart because her lord and master leaves her.' They say nothing, absolutely nothing, about suttee or its practice, which from the beginning has been a damnable invention of the priests. But the practice of suttee has continued. I have warned the government frequently, in writing, but for reasons which I do not profess to understand they have made no move as yet. For that reason, and for no other, I have tried to be a thorn in your side, and will continue to try to be until this suttee ceases!\"\n\n\"Why,\" demanded Howrah, \"since you are a foreigner with neither influence nor right, do you stay here and behold what you cannot change? Does a snake lie sleeping on an ant-hill? Does a woman watch the butchering of lambs? Yet, do ant-hills cease to be, and are lambs not butchered? Look the other way! Sleep softer in another place!\"\n\n\"I am a prisoner. For months past my daughter and I have been prisoners to all intents and purposes, and you, Maharajah-sahib, have known it well. Now, the one man who was left to be our escort to another place is a prisoner, too. You know that, too. And you ask me why I stay! Suppose you answer?\"\n\nRosemary squeezed his hand again, this time less to restrain him than herself. She was torn between an inclination to laugh at the daring or shiver at the indiscretion of taking to task a man whose one word could place them at the mercy of the priests of Siva, or the mob. But Duncan McClean, a little bowed about the shoulders, peered through his spectacles and waited--quite unawed by all the splendor--for the Maharajah's answer.\n\n\"Of what man do you speak?\" asked Howrah, still undecided what to do with them, and anxious above all things to disguise his thoughts. \"What man is a prisoner, and how do you know it?\"\n\nBefore McClean had time to answer him, a spear haft rang on the great teak double door. There was a pause, and the clang repeated--another pause--a third reverberating, humming metal notice of an interruption, and the doors swung wide. A Hindoo, salaaming low so that the expression of his face could not be seen, called out down the long length of the hall.\n\n\"The Alwa-sahib waits, demanding audience!\" There was no change apparent on Howrah's face. His fingers tightened on the jewelled cimeter that protruded, silk-sashed, from his middle, but neither voice nor eyes nor lips betrayed the least emotion. It was the McCleans whose eyes blazed with a new-born hope, that was destined to be dashed a second later.\n\n\"Has he guards with him?\"\n\n\"But ten, Maharajah-sahib.\"\n\n\"Then remove these people to the place where they were, and afterward admit him--without his guards!\"\n\n\"I demand permission to speak with this Alwa-sahib!\" said McClean.\n\n\"Remove them!\"\n\nTwo spear-armed custodians of the door advanced. Resistance was obviously futile. Still holding his daughter's hand, the missionary let himself be led to the outer hall and down a corridor, where, presently, a six-inch door shut prisoners and guards even from sound of what transpired beyond.\n\nAlwa, swaggering until his long spurs jingled like a bunch of keys each time his boot-heels struck the marble floor, strode straight as a soldier up to the raised throne dais--took no notice whatever of the sudden slamming of the door behind him--looked knife-keenly into Howrah's eyes--and saluted with a flourish.\n\n\"I come from bursting open Jaimihr's buzzard roost!\" he intimated mildly. \"He held a man of mine. I have the man.\"\n\nMerely to speak first was insolence; but that breach of etiquette was nothing to his manner and his voice. It appeared that he was so utterly confident of his own prowess that he could afford to speak casually; he did not raise his voice or emphasize a word. He was a man of his word, relating facts, and every line of his steel-thewed anatomy showed it.",
    "There was a clatter of hoofs, and they all looked up in time to see the tails of the last four chargers disappearing round the corner, downward. They had gone--full pelt--down a path that a man might hesitate to take! From where they stood, there was an archer's view of every inch of the only rock-hewn road that led from the gate to the summit of the cliff; an enemy who had burst the gate in would have had to climb in the teeth of a searching hail of missiles, with little chance of shooting back.\n\nThey could see the gate itself, and Jaimihr on the other side. And, swooping--shooting--sliding down the trail like a storm-loosed avalanche, they could see the nine go, led by Alwa. No living creature could have looked away!\n\nBelow, entirely unconscious of the coming shock, the mounted sepoys waited behind Jaimihr in four long, straight lines. Jaimihr himself, with a heavy-hilted cimeter held upward at the \"carry,\" was about four charger lengths beyond the iron screen, ready to spur through. Close by him were a dozen, waiting to ram a big beam in and hold up the gate when it had opened. And, full-tilt down the gorge, flash-tipped like a thunderbolt, gray-turbaned, reckless, whirling death ripped down on them.\n\nThey caught sound of the hammering hoofs too late. Two gongs boomed in the rock. The windlass creaked. Five seconds too late Jaimihr gathered up his reins, spurred, wheeled, and shouted to the men behind him. The great gate rose, like the jaws of a hungry monster, and the nine--streaking too fast down far too steep a slide to stop themselves--burst straight out under it and struck, as a wind blast smites a poppy-field.\n\nJaimihr was borne backward--carried off his horse. Alwa and the first four rode him down, and crashed through the four-deep line beyond; the second four pounced on him, gathered him, and followed. Before the lines could form again the whole nine wheeled--as a wind-eddy spins on its own axis--and burst through back again, the horses racing neck and neck, and the sabres cutting down a swath to screech and swear and gurgle in among the trampled garden stuff.\n\nThey came back in a line, all eight abreast, Alwa leading only by a length. At the opening, four horses--two on either side--slid, rump to the ground, until their noses touched the rock. Alwa and four dashed through and under; the rest recovered, spun on their haunches, and followed. The gongs boomed again down in the belly of the rock, and the gate clanged shut.\n\n\"That was good,\" said Mahommed Gunga quietly. \"Now, watch again!\"\n\nAlmost before the words had left his lips, a hail of lead barked out from twenty vantage-points, and the smoke showed where some forty men were squinting down steel barrels, shooting as rapidly and as rottenly as natives of India usually do. They did little execution; but before Alwa and his eight had climbed up the steep track to the summit, patting their horses' necks and reviling Jaimihr as they came, the cavalry below had scampered out of range, leaving their dead and wounded where they lay.\n\n\"How is that for a start, sahib?\" demanded Mahommed Gunga exultantly, as two men deposited the dishevelled Jaimihr on his feet, and the Prince glared around him like a man awaking from a dream. \"How is that for a beginning?\"\n\n\"As bad as could be!\" answered Cunningham. \"It was well executed--bold--clever--anything you like, Mahommed Gunga, but--if I'd been asked I'd have sooner made the devil prisoner! Jaimihr is no use at all to us in here. Outside, he'd be veritable godsend!\"",
    "Cunningham and Mahommed Gunga each took one step forward, and the Sikh gave Cunningham a tiny, folded piece of paper, stuck together along one edge with native gum. He tore it open, read it in the light of a trooper's lantern, and then read it again aloud to Mahommed Gunga, pitching his voice high enough for Alwa to listen if he chose.\n\n\"What are you two men doing?\" ran the note. \"The very worst has happened. We all need men immediately, and I particularly need them. One hundred troopers now would be better than a thousand men a month from now. Hurry, and send word by bearer. S. F. BYNG.\"\n\n\"How soon can you start back?\" asked Cunningham.\n\n\"The minute I am provided with a horse, sahib.\"\n\nCunningham turned to Alwa.\n\n\"Will you be kind enough to feed him, Alwa-sahib?\"\n\nAlwa resented the imputation against his hospitality instantly.\n\n\"Nay, I was waiting for his money in advance!\" he laughed. \"Food waits, thou. Thou art a Sikh--thou eatest meat--meat, then, is ready.\"\n\nThe Sikh, or at least the true Sikh, is not hampered by a list of caste restrictions. All of his precepts, taken singly or collectively, bid him be nothing but a man, and no law forbids him accept the hospitality of soldiers of another creed. So Jaidev Singh walked off to feed on curried beef that would have made a Hindoo know himself for damned. Cunningham then turned on Alwa.\n\n\"Now is the time, Alwa-sahib,\" he said in a level voice. \"My party can start off with this man and our answer, if your answer is no. If your answer is yes, then the Sikh can bear that answer for us.\"\n\n\"You would none of you ride half a mile alive!\" laughed Alwa.\n\n\"I none the less require an answer, Alwa-sahib.\"\n\nAlwa stared hard at him. That was the kind of talk that went straight to his soldier heart. He loved a man who held to his point in the teeth of odds. The odds, it seemed to him, were awfully against Cunningham.\n\n\"So was thy father,\" he said slowly. \"My cousin said thou wast thy father's son!\"\n\n\"I require an answer by the time that the Sikh has finished eating,\" said Cunningham. \"Otherwise, Alwa-sabib, I shall regret the necessity of foregoing further hospitality at your hands.\"\n\n\"Bismillah! Am I servant here or master?\" wondered Alwa, loud enough for all his men to hear. Then he thought better of his dignity. \"Sahib,\" he insisted, \"I will not talk here before my men. We will have another conference.\"\n\n\"I concede you ten minutes,\" said Cunningham, preparing to follow him, and followed in turn by Mohammed Gunga.\n\n\"Now, swore the Risaldar into his beard, we shall see the reaching of decisions! Now, by the curse of the sack of Chitor we shall know who is on whose side, or I am no Rangar, nor the son of one!\"\n\n\"I have a suggestion to make, sahib,\" smiled Alwa, closing the door of the rock-hewn chamber on the three of them.\n\n\"Hear mine first!\" said Cunningham, with a hint of iron in his voice.\n\n\"Ay! Hear his first! Hear Chota-Cunnigan-bahadur!\" echoed Mahommed Gunga. \"Let us hear a plan worth hearing!\" And Alwa looked into a pair of steady eyes that seemed to see through him--past him--to the finished work beyond.\n\n\"Speak, sahib.\"\n\n\"You are pledged to uphold Howrah on his throne?\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib.\"\n\n\"Then, I guarantee you shall! You shall not go to the Company's aid until you have satisfactory guarantees that your homes and friends will not be assailed behind your backs.\"\n\n\"Guarantees to whose satisfaction, sahib?\"\n\n\"Yours!\"\n\n\"But with whom am I dealing?\" Alwa seemed actually staggered. \"Who makes these promises? The Company?\"\n\n\"I give you my solemn word of honor on it!\"\n\n\"It is at least a man who speaks!\" swore Alwa.\n\n\"It is the son of Cunnigan-bahadur!\" growled Mahommed Gunga, standing chin erect. He seemed in no doubt now of the outcome. He was merely waiting for it with soldierly and ill-concealed impatience.\n\n\"But, sahib--\"\n\n\"Alwa-sahib, we have no time for argument. It is yes or no. I must send an answer back by that Sikh. He must--he shall take my answer! Either you are loyal to our cause or you are not. Are you?\"\n\n\"By the breath of God, sahib, I am thinking you leave me little choice!\"\n\n\"I still await an answer. I am calling on you for as many men as you can raise, and I have made you specific promises. Choose, Alwa-sahib. Yes or no?\"\n\n\"The answer is yes--but--\"\n\n\"Then I understand that you undertake to obey my orders without question until such time as a senior to me can be found to take over the command.\"\n\n\"That is contingent on the agreement,\" hesitated Alwa.\n\n\"I would like your word of honor, Alwa-sahib.\"\n\n\"I pledge that not lightly, sahib.\"\n\n\"For that very good reason I am asking for it. I shall know how far to trust when I have your word of honor!\"\n\n\"I knew thy father! Thou art his son! I trusted him for good reason and with good result. I will trust thee also. My word is given, on thy conditions, sahib. First, the guarantees before we ride to the British aid!\"\n\n\"And you obey my orders?\"\n\n\"Yes. My word is given, sahib. The oath of a Rajput, of a Rangar, of a soldier, of a zemindar of the House of Kachwaha; the oath of a man to a man, sahib; the promise of thy father's friend to thy father's son! Bahadur\"--he drew himself to his full height, and clicked his spurs together--\"I am thy servant!\"",
    "When the cell-door creaked open, Alwa and Mahommed Gunga were crouched one on either side, listening with the ears of soldiers that do not let many sounds or words escape them.\n\n\"Jaimihr-sahib!\" she whispered. \"Jaimihr-sahib!\"\n\n\"Ha! Sahiba!\" Then he called her by half a dozen names that made the listening Rangars grin into their beards.\n\n\"Jaimihr-sahib\"--she raised her voice a little now--\"if I help you to escape, will you promise me my safety under all conditions?\"\n\n\"Surely, sahiba!\"\n\n\"Do you swear to protect every living person on this hill, including the Alwa-sahib and Cunningham-sahib?\"\n\n\"Surely, sahiba.\"\n\n\"You swear it?\"\n\n\"I swear it on my honor. There is no more sacred oath.\"\n\n\"Then, listen. I can help you to escape now. I have a rope that is long enough to lower you over the parapet. I am prepared to risk the consequences, but I want to bargain with you for aid for my Countrymen.\"\n\nJaimihr did not answer.\n\n\"The Alwa-sahib and his Rangars stand pledged to help your brother!\"\n\n\"I guessed at least that much,\" laughed Jaimihr.\n\n\"They would not help you against him under any circumstances. But they want to ride to the Company's aid, and they might be prepared to protect you against him. They might guarantee the safety of your palace and your men's homes. They might exact a guarantee from Howrah.\"\n\nJaimihr laughed aloud, careless of the risk of being overheard, and Rosemary knew that Cunningham's little plan was useless even before it had been quite expounded. She felt herself trembling for the consequences.\n\n\"Sahiba, there is only one condition that would make me ride to the British aid with all my men.\"\n\n\"Name it!\"\n\n\"Thou art it!\"\n\n\"I don't understand you, Jaimihr-sahib,\" she whispered, understanding all too well.\n\n\"Follow me. Come to me in Howrah. Then whatever these fool Rangars choose to do, I swear by Siva and the Rites of Siva that I will hurry to the Company's aid!\"\n\nRosemary McClean shuddered, and he knew it. But that fact rather added to his pleasure. The wolf prefers a cowering, frightened prey even though he dare fight on occasion. She was thinking against time. Through that one small, overburdened head, besides a splitting headache, there was flashing the ghastly thought of what was happening to her countrymen and women--of what would happen unless she hurried to do something for their aid. All the burden of all warring India seemed to be resting on her shoulders, in a stifling cell; and Jaimihr seemed to be the only help in sight.\n\n\"How many men could you summon to the Company's aid?\" she asked him.\n\nHe laughed. \"Ten thousand!\" he boasted.\n\n\"Armed and drilled men--soldiers fit to fight?\"\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"I think that is a lie, Jaimihr-sahib. There is not time enough to waste on lies. Tell me the exact truth, please.\"\n\nHe contrived to save his face, or, rather, he contrived to make himself believe he did.\n\n\"I would need some to guard my rear,\" he answered. \"I could lead five thousand to the British aid.\"\n\n\"Is that the truth?\"\n\n\"On my honor, sahiba.\"\n\n\"And you wish to marry me?\"\n\n\"Sahiba--I--I have no other wish!\"\n\n\"I agree to marry you provided you will lead five thousand men to the Company's aid, but not until you have done so.\"\n\n\"You will come to Howrah?\"\n\nShe could feel his excitement. The cell walls seemed to throb.\n\n\"Yes; but I shall come accompanied by my father, and Mr. Cunningham, and all the Rangars he can raise. And I shall hold you to your bargain. You must help the Company first. FIRST--d'you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\nIt was Jaimihr's turn now to lay the law down. She had let him see her eagerness to gain his aid for the Company, and he saw the weakness of her case in an instant. He knew very well, too, that no woman of her breed would have thought of consenting to marry him unless her hand was forced. He decided immediately to force it further.\n\n\"I understand, sahiba. I, too, will hold thee to thy promise! Thou wilt come with an escort, as befits a prince's wife! But how should I know that the Rangars would prove friends of mine? How should I know that it is not all a trap?\"\n\n\"You will have my promise to depend on.\"\n\n\"Truly! And there will be how many hundred men to override the promise of one woman? Nay! My word is good; my promise holds; but on my own conditions! Help me to escape. Then follow me to Howrah City. Come in advance of thy Rangar escort. By that I will know that the Rangars and this Cunningham are my friends--otherwise they would not let thee come. The Rangars are to exact guarantees from my brother? How should I know that they do not come to help my brother crush me out of existence? With thee in my camp as hostage I would risk agreement with them, but not otherwise. Escape with me now, or follow. But bring no Rangars, sahiba! Come alone!\"",
    "Cunningham, unruffled and undecided still, made out through puckered eyes the six-horse carriage in which Miss McClean evidently was; it was drawn up close beside the wall, and two regiments were between it and his squadron. He was recalling the terms of the agreement made with Jaimihr; he remembered it included the sparing of all of Alwa's men, and not the firing on them.\n\nA thousand of Jaimihr's cavalry swooped from the shelter of the infantry, opened out a very little, and, mistaking Cunningham's delay for fear, bore down with a cheer and something very like determination.\n\nThey were met some ten yards their side of the half-way mark by Cunningham's three squadrons, loosed and led by Cunningham himself. Outridden, outfought, outgeneralled, they were smashed through, ridden down, and whirled back reeling in confusion. About a hundred of them reached the shelter of the infantry in a formed-up body; many of the rest charged through it in a mob and threw it into confusion.\n\nToo late Jaimihr decided on more reasonable tactics. Too late he gave orders to his infantry that no such confused body could obey. Before he could ride to rally them, the Rangars were in them, at them, through them, over them. The whole was disintegrating in retreat, endeavoring to rally and reform in different places, each subdivision shouting orders to its nearest neighbor and losing heart as its appeals for help were disregarded.\n\nBack came Cunningham's close-formed squadrons, straight through the writhing mass again; and now the whole of Jaimihr's army took to its heels, just as part of the five-feet-thick stone palace-wall succumbed to the attacks of crowbars and crashed down in the roadway, disclosing a dark vault on the other side.\n\nJaimihr made a rush for the six-horse carriage, and tried vainly to get it started. Cunningham shouted to him to surrender, but he took no notice of the challenge; he escaped being made prisoner by the narrowest of margins, as the postilion next him was cut down. The other postilions were un-horsed, and six Rangars changed mounts and seized the reins. The Prince ran one man through the middle, and then spurred off to try and overtake his routed army, some of which showed a disposition to form up again.\n\n\"Sit quiet!\" called Cunningham through the latticed carriage window. \"You're safe!\"\n\nThe heavy, swaying carriage rumbled round, and the horses plunged in answer to the Rangars' heels. A moment later it was moving at a gallop; two minutes later it was backed against the wall, and Rosemary McClean stepped out behind three protecting squadrons that had not suffered perceptibly from what they would have scorned to call a battle.\n\n\"Now all together!\" shouted Cunningham, whose theories on the value of seconds when tackling reforming infantry were worthy of the Duke of Wellington, or any other officer who knew his business; and again he led his men at a breakneck charge. This time Jaimihr's disheartened little army did not wait for him, but broke into wild confusion and scattered right and left, leaving their elephants to be captured. There were only a few men killed. The lance-tipped, roaring whirlwind loosed itself for the most part against nothing, and reformed uninjured to trot back again. Cunningham told off two troops to pursue fugitives and keep their eyes open for the Prince before he rode back to examine the breach in the wall that Jaimihr had been to so much trouble about making.\n\nHe had halted to peer through the break in the age-old masonry when Mahommed Gunga spurred up close to him, touched his arm, and pointed.\n\n\"Look, sahib! Look!\"\n\nJaimihr--and no one but a wizard could have told how he had managed to get to where he was unobserved--was riding as a man rides at a tent-peg, crouching low, full-pelt for Rosemary McClean!\n\nCunningham's spurs went home before the word was out of Mahommed Gunga's mouth, and Mahommed Gunga raced behind him; but Jaimihr had the start of them. Duncan McClean, looking ill and weak and helpless, crowded his daughter to the wall, standing between her and the Prince; but Jaimihr aimed a swinging sabre at him, and the missionary fell. His daughter stooped to bend over him, and Jaimihr seized her below the arms. A second later he had hoisted her to his saddle-bow and was spurring hell-bent-for-leather for the open country.\n\nTwo things prevented him from making his escape. Five of Alwa's men, returning from pursuing fugitives, cut off his flight in one direction, and the extra weight on his horse prevented him from getting clear by means of speed alone--as he might have done otherwise, for Cunningham's mare was growing tired.\n\nJaimihr rode for two minutes with the frenzy of a savage before he saw the futility of it. It was Cunningham's mare, gaining on him stride over stride, that warned him he would be cut down like a dog from behind unless he surrendered or let go his prize."

  "Edgar Wallace -- Sanders of the river": [
    "Mr. Commissioner Sanders had graduated to West Central Africa by such easy stages that he did not realise when his acquaintance with the back lands began. Long before he was called upon by the British Government to keep a watchful eye upon some quarter of a million cannibal folk, who ten years before had regarded white men as we regard the unicorn; he had met the Basuto, the Zulu, the Fingo, the Pondo, Matabele, Mashona, Barotse, Hottentot, and Bechuana. Then curiosity and interest took him westward and northward, and he met the Angola folk, then northward to the Congo, westward to the Masai, and finally, by way of the Pigmy people, he came to his own land.\n\nNow, there is a subtle difference between all these races, a difference that only such men as Sanders know.\n\nIt is not necessarily a variety of colour, though some are brown and some yellow, and some--a very few--jet black. The difference is in character. By Sanders' code you trusted all natives up to the same point, as you trust children, with a few notable exceptions. The Zulu were men, the Basuto were men, yet childlike in their grave faith. The black men who wore the fez were subtle, but trustworthy; but the browny men of the Gold Coast, who talked English, wore European clothing, and called one another \"Mr.,\" were Sanders' pet abomination.\n\nLiving so long with children of a larger growth, it follows that he absorbed many of their childlike qualities. Once, on furlough in London, a confidence trick was played on him, and only his natural honesty pulled him out of a ridiculous scrape. For, when the gold-brick man produced his dull metal ingot, all Sanders' moral nerves stood endways, and he ran the confiding \"bunco steerer\" to the nearest station, charging him, to the astonishment of a sorely-puzzled policeman, with \"I.G.B.,\" which means illicit gold buying. Sanders did not doubt that the ingot was gold, but he was equally certain that the gold was not honestly come by. His surprise when he found that the \"gold\" was gold-leaf imposed upon the lead of commerce was pathetic.\n\nYou may say of Sanders that he was a statesman, which means that he had no exaggerated opinion of the value of individual human life. When he saw a dead leaf on the plant of civilisation, he plucked it off, or a weed growing with his \"flowers\" he pulled it up, not stopping to consider the weed's equal right to life. When a man, whether he was _capita_ or slave, by his bad example endangered the peace of his country, Sanders fell upon him. In their unregenerate days, the Isisi called him \"Ogani Isisi,\" which means \"The Little Butcher Bird,\" and certainly in that time Sanders was prompt to hang. He governed a people three hundred miles beyond the fringe of civilisation. Hesitation to act, delay in awarding punishment, either of these two things would have been mistaken for weakness amongst a people who had neither power to reason, nor will to excuse, nor any large charity.\n\nIn the land which curves along the borders of Togo the people understand punishment to mean pain and death, and nothing else counts. There was a foolish Commissioner who was a great humanitarian, and he went up to Akasava--which is the name of this land--and tried moral suasion.\n\nIt was a raiding palaver. Some of the people of Akasava had crossed the river to Ochori and stolen women and goats, and I believe there was a man or two killed, but that is unimportant. The goats and the women were alive, and cried aloud for vengeance. They cried so loud that down at headquarters they were heard and Mr. Commissioner Niceman--that was not his name, but it will serve--went up to see what all the noise was about. He found the Ochori people very angry, but more frightened.\n\n\"If,\" said their spokesman, \"they will return our goats, they may keep the women, because the goats are very valuable.\"\n\nSo Mr. Commissioner Niceman had a long, long palaver that lasted days and days, with the chief of the Akasava people and his councillors, and in the end moral suasion triumphed, and the people promised on a certain day, at a certain hour, when the moon was in such a quarter and the tide at such a height, the women should be returned and the goats also.\n\nSo Mr. Niceman returned to headquarters, swelling with admiration for himself and wrote a long report about his genius and his administrative abilities, and his knowledge of the native, which was afterwards published in Blue Book (Africa) 7943-96.\n\n\nIt so happened that Mr. Niceman immediately afterwards went home to England on furlough, so that he did not hear the laments and woeful wailings of the Ochori folk when they did not get their women or their goats.\n\nSanders, working round the Isisi River, with ten Houssas and an attack of malaria, got a helio message:\n\n\"Go Akasava and settle that infernal woman palaver.--Administration.\"\n\nSo Sanders girded up his loins, took 25 grains of quinine, and leaving his good work--he was searching for M'Beli, the witch-doctor, who had poisoned a friend--trekked across country for the Akasava.\n\nIn the course of time he came to the city and was met by the chief.\n\n\"What about these women?\" he asked.\n\n\"We will have a palaver,\" said the chief. \"I will summon my headmen and my councillors.\"\n\n\"Summon nothing,\" said Sanders shortly. \"Send back the women and the goats you stole from the Ochori.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the chief, \"at full moon, which is our custom, when the tide is so, and all signs of gods and devils are propitious, I will do as you bid.\"\n\n\"Chief,\" said Sanders, tapping the ebony chest of the other with the thin end of his walking-stick, \"moon and river, gods or devils, those women and the goats go back to the Ochori folk by sunset, or I tie you to a tree and flog you till you bleed.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the chief, \"the women shall be returned.\"\n\n\"And the goats,\" said Sanders.\n\n\"As to the goats,\" said the chief airily, \"they are dead, having been killed for a feast.\"\n\n\"You will bring them back to life,\" said Sanders.\n\n\"Master, do you think I am a magician?\" asked the chief of the Akasava.\n\n\"I think you are a liar,\" said Sanders impartially, and there the palaver finished.\n\n\nThat night goats and women returned to the Ochori, and Sanders prepared to depart.\n\nHe took aside the chief, not desiring to put shame upon him or to weaken his authority.\n\n\"Chief,\" he said, \"it is a long journey to Akasava, and I am a man fulfilling many tasks. I desire that you do not cause me any further journey to this territory.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said the chief truthfully, \"I never wish to see you again.\"\n\nSanders smiled aside, collected his ten Houssas, and went back to the Isisi River to continue his search for M'Beli.",
    "There is a people who live at Ochori in the big African forest on the Ikeli River, who are called in the native tongue \"The Keepers of the Stone.\"\n\nThere is a legend that years and years ago, _cala-cala_, there was a strange, flat stone, \"inscribed with the marks of the devils\" (so the grave native story-teller puts it), which was greatly worshipped and prized, partly for its magic powers, and partly because of the two ghosts who guarded it.\n\nIt was a fetish of peculiar value to the mild people who lived in the big forest, but the Akasava, who are neither mild nor reverential, and being, moreover, in need of gods, swooped down upon the Ochori one red morning and came away with this wonderful stone and other movables. Presumably, the \"ghosts of brass\" went also. It was a great business, securing the stone, for it was set in a grey slab in the solid rock, and many spear-heads were broken before it could be wrenched from its place. But in the end it was taken away, and for several years it was the boast of the Akasava that they derived much benefit from this sacred possession. Then of a sudden the stone disappeared, and with it all the good fortune of its owners. For the vanishing of the stone coincided with the arrival of British rule, and it was a bad thing for the Akasava.\n\nThere came in these far-off days ('95?) a ridiculous person in white with an escort of six soldiers. He brought a message of peace and good fellowship, and talked of a new king and a new law. The Akasava listened in dazed wonderment, but when they recovered they cut off his head, also the heads of the escort. It seemed to be the only thing to do under the circumstances.\n\nThen one morning the Akasava people woke to find the city full of strange white folk, who had come swiftly up the river in steamboats. There were too many to quarrel with, so the people sat quiet, a little frightened and very curious, whilst two black soldiers strapped the hands and feet of the Akasava chief prior to hanging him by the neck till he was dead.\n\nNor did the bad luck of the people end here; there came a lean year, when the manioc root was bad and full of death-water, when goats died, and crops were spoilt by an unexpected hurricane. There was always a remedy at hand for a setback of this kind. If you have not the thing you require, go and take it. So, following precedents innumerable, the Akasava visited the Ochori, taking away much grain, and leaving behind dead men and men who prayed for death. In the course of time the white men came with their steamboats, their little brass guns, and the identical block and tackle, which they fastened to the identical tree and utilised in the inevitable manner.\n\n\"It appears,\" said the new chief--who was afterwards hanged for the killing of the king of the Isisi--\"that the white man's law is made to allow weak men to triumph at the expense of the strong. This seems foolish, but it will be well to humour them.\"\n\nHis first act was to cut down the hanging-tree--it was too conspicuous and too significant. Then he set himself to discover the cause of all the trouble which had come upon the Akasava. The cause required little appreciation. The great stone had been stolen, as he well knew, and the remedy resolved itself into a question of discovering the thief. The wretched Ochori were suspect.\n\n\"If we go to them,\" said the chief of the Akasava thoughtfully, \"killing them very little, but rather burning them, so that they told where this godstone was hidden, perhaps the Great Ones would forgive us.\"\n\n\"In my young days,\" said an aged councillor, \"when evil men would not tell where stolen things were buried, we put hot embers in their hands and bound them tightly.\"\n\n\"That is a good way,\" approved another old man, wagging his head applaudingly; \"also to tie men in the path of the soldier-ants has been known to make them talkative.\"\n\n\"Yet we may not go up against the Ochori for many reasons,\" said the chief; \"the principal of which is that if the stone be with them we shall not overcome them owing to the two ghosts--though I do not remember that the ghosts were very potent in the days when the stone was with us,\" he added, not without hope.\n\n\nThe little raid which followed and the search for the stone are told briefly in official records. The search was fruitless, and the Akasava folk must needs content themselves with such picking as came to hand.\n\nOf how Mr. Niceman, the deputy commissioner, and then Sanders himself, came up, I have already told. That was long ago, as the natives say, _cala-cala_, and many things happened subsequently that put from the minds of the people all thought of the stone.\n\nIn course of time the chief of the Akasava died the death for various misdoings, and peace came to the land that fringes Togo.",
    "For many years have the Ochori people formed a sort of grim comic relief to the tragedy of African colonisation. Now it may well be that we shall laugh at the Ochori no more. Nor, in the small hours of the night, when conversation flags in the little circle about the fires in fishing camps, shall the sleepy-eyed be roused to merriment by stories of Ochori meekness. All this has come about by favour of the Liberian Government, though at present the Liberian Government is not aware of the fact.\n\nWith all due respect to the Republic of Liberia, I say that the Monrovians are naturally liars and thieves.\n\nOnce upon a time, that dignity might be added to the State, a warship was acquired--if I remember aright it was presented by a disinterested shipowner. The Government appointed three admirals, fourteen captains, and as many officers as the ship would hold, and they all wore gorgeous but ill-fitting uniforms. The Government would have appointed a crew also, but for the fact that the ship was not big enough to hold any larger number of people than its officers totalled.\n\nThis tiny man-of-war of the black republic went to sea once, the admirals and captains taking it in turn to stoke and steer--a very pleasing and novel sensation, this latter.\n\nComing back into the harbour, one of the admirals said--\"It is my turn to steer now,\" and took the wheel.\n\nThe ship struck a rock at the entrance of the harbour and went down. The officers escaped easily enough, for your Monrovian swims like a fish, but their uniforms were spoilt by the sea water. To the suggestion that salvage operations should be attempted to refloat the warship, the Government very wisely said no, they thought not.\n\n\"We know where she is,\" said the President--he was sitting on the edge of his desk at Government House, eating sardines with his fingers--\"and if we ever want her, it will be comforting to know she is so close to us.\"\n\nNothing more would have been done in the matter but for the fact that the British Admiralty decided that the wreck was a danger to shipping, and issued orders forthwith for the place where it lay to be buoyed.\n\nThe Liberian Government demurred on account of expense, but on pressure being applied (I suspect the captain of H.M.S. _Dwarf_, who was a man with a bitter tongue) they agreed, and the bell-buoy was anchored to the submerged steamer.\n\nIt made a nice rowdy, clanging noise, did that bell, and the people of Monrovia felt they were getting their money's worth.\n\nBut all Monrovia is not made up of the freed American slaves who were settled there in 1821. There are people who are described in a lordly fashion by the true Monrovians as \"indigenous natives,\" and the chief of these are the Kroomen, who pay no taxes, defy the Government, and at intervals tweak the official nose of the Republic.\n\nThe second day after the bell was in place, Monrovia awoke to find a complete silence reigning in the bay, and that in spite of a heavy swell. The bell was still, and two ex-admirals, who were selling fish on the foreshore, borrowed a boat and rowed out to investigate. The explanation was simple--the bell had been stolen.\n\n\"Now!\" said the President of the Liberian Republic in despair, \"may Beelzebub, who is the father and author of all sin, descend upon these thieving Kroomen!\"\n\nAnother bell was attached. The same night it was stolen. Yet another bell was put to the buoy, and a boat-load of admirals kept watch. Throughout the night they sat, rising and falling with the swell, and the monotonous \"clang-jangle-clong\" was music in their ears. All night it sounded, but in the early morning, at the dark hour before the sun comes up, it seemed that the bell, still tolling, grew fainter and fainter.\n\n\"Brothers,\" said an admiral, \"we are drifting away from the bell.\"\n\nBut the explanation was that the bell had drifted away from them, for, tired of half measures, the Kroomen had come and taken the buoy, bell and all, and to this day there is no mark to show where a sometime man-of-war rots in the harbour of Monrovia.\n\nThe ingenious soul who planned and carried out this theft was one Bosambo, who had three wives, one of whom, being by birth Congolaise, and untrustworthy, informed the police, and with some ceremony Bosambo was arrested and tried at the Supreme Court, where he was found guilty of \"theft and high treason\" and sentenced to ten years' penal servitude.\n\nThey took Bosambo back to prison, and Bosambo interviewed the black gaoler.\n\n\"My friend,\" he said, \"I have a big ju-ju in the forest, and if you do not release me at once you and your wife shall die in great torment.\"\n\n\"Of your ju-ju I know nothing,\" said the gaoler philosophically, \"but I receive two dollars a week for guarding prisoners, and if I let you escape I shall lose my job.\"\n\n\"I know a place where there is much silver hidden,\" said Bosambo with promptitude. \"You and I will go to this place, and we shall be rich.\"\n\n\"If you knew where there was silver, why did you steal bells, which are of brass and of no particular value?\" asked his unimaginative guard.\n\n\"I see that you have a heart of stone,\" said Bosambo, and went away to the forest settlement to chop down trees for the good of the State.",
    "What date had been chosen for the rising we may never know for certain. What is known is that the Akasava, the N'Gombi, the Isisi, and the Boleki folk were preparing in secret for a time of killing, when there came the great news. Sandi was dead. A canoe had overturned on the Isisi River, and the swift current had swept the Commissioner away, and though men ran up and down the bank no other sign of him was visible but a great white helmet that floated, turning slowly, out of sight. So a man of the Akasava reported, having learnt it from a sergeant of Houssas, and instantly the _lo-koli_ beat sharply, and the headmen of the villages came panting to the palaver house to meet the paramount chief of the Akasava.\n\n\"Sandi is dead,\" said the chief solemnly. \"He was our father and our mother and carried us in his arms; we loved him and did many disagreeable things for him because of our love. But now that he is dead, and there is none to say 'Yea' or 'Nay' to us, the time of which I have spoken to you secretly has come; therefore let us take up our arms and go out, first against the God-men who pray and bewitch us with the sprinkling of water, then against the chief of the Ochori, who for many years have put shame upon us.\"\n\n\"Master,\" said a little chief from the fishing village which is near to the Ochori border, \"is it wise--our Lord Sandi having said there shall be no war?\"\n\n\"Our Lord Sandi is dead,\" said the paramount chief wisely; \"and being dead, it does not greatly concern us what he said; besides which,\" he said, as a thought struck him, \"last night I had a dream and saw Sandi; he was standing amidst great fires, and he said, 'Go forth and bring me the head of the chief of the Ochori.'\"\n\nNo further time was wasted.\n\nThat night the men of twenty villages danced the dance of killing, and the great fire of the Akasava burnt redly on the sandy beach to the embarrassment of a hippo family that lived in the high grasses near by.\n\nIn the grey of the morning the Akasava chief mustered six hundred spears and three score of canoes, and he delivered his oration:\n\n\"First, we will destroy the mission men, for they are white, and it is not right that they should live and Sandi be dead; then we will go against Bosambo, the chief of the Ochori. When rains came in the time of kidding, he who is a foreigner and of no human origin brought many evil persons with him and destroyed our fishing villages, and Sandi said there should be no killing. Now Sandi is dead, and, I do not doubt, in hell, and there is none to hold our pride.\"\n\nRound the bend of the river, ever so slowly, for she was breasting a strong and treacherous current, came the nose of the _Zaire_. It is worthy of note that the little blue flag at her stern was not at half-mast. The exact significance of this was lost on the Akasava. Gingerly the little craft felt its way to the sandy strip of beach, a plank was thrust forth, and along it came, very dapper and white, his little ebony stick with the silver knob swinging between his fingers, Mr. Commissioner Sanders, very much alive, and there were two bright Maxim-guns on either side of the gangway that covered the beach.\n\nA nation, paralysed by fear and apprehension, watched the _debarquement_, the chief of the Akasava being a little in advance of his painted warriors.\n\nOn Sanders' face was a look of innocent surprise. \"Chief,\" said he, \"you do me great honour that you gather your young men to welcome me; nevertheless, I would rather see them working in their gardens.\"\n\nHe walked along one row of fighting men, plentifully besmeared with cam-wood, and his was the leisurely step of some great personage inspecting a guard of honour.\n\n\"I perceive,\" he went on, talking over his shoulder to the chief who, fascinated by the unexpected vision, followed him, \"I perceive that each man has a killing spear, also a fighting shield of wicker work, and many have N'Gombi swords.\"\n\n\"Lord, it is true,\" said the chief, recovering his wits, \"for we go hunting elephant in the Great Forest.\"\n\n\"Also that some have the little bones of men fastened about their necks--that is not for the elephant.\"\n\nHe said this meditatively, musingly, as he continued his inspection, and the chief was frankly embarrassed.\n\n\"There is a rumour,\" he stammered, \"it is said--there came a spy who told us--that the Ochori were gathering for war, and we were afraid----\"\n\n\"Strange,\" said Sanders, half to himself, but speaking in the vernacular, \"strange indeed is this story, for I have come straight from the Ochori city, and there I saw nothing but men who ground corn and hunted peacefully; also their chief is ill, suffering from a fever.\"\n\nHe shook his head in well-simulated bewilderment.\n\n\"Lord,\" said the poor chief of the Akasava, \"perhaps men have told us lies--such things have happened----\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Sanders gravely. \"This is a country of lies; some say that I am dead; and, lo! the news has gone around that there is no law in the land, and men may kill and war at their good pleasure.\"\n\n\"Though I die at this minute,\" said the chief virtuously, \"though the river turn to fire and consume my inmost stomach, though every tree become a tiger to devour me, I have not dreamt of war.\"\n\nSanders grinned internally.\n\n\"Spare your breath,\" he said gently. \"You who go hunting elephants, for it is a long journey to the Great Forest, and there are many swamps to be crossed, many rivers to be swum. My heart is glad that I have come in time to bid you farewell.\"\n\nThere was a most impressive silence, for this killing of elephants was a stray excuse of the chief's. The Great Forest is a journey of two months, one to get there and one to return, and is moreover through the most cursed country, and the Akasava are not a people that love long journeys save with the current of the river.\n\nThe silence was broken by the chief.\n\n\"Lord, we desire to put off our journey in your honour, for if we go, how shall we gather in palaver?\"\n\nSanders shook his head.\n\n\"Let no man stop the hunter,\" quoth he. \"Go in peace, chief, and you shall secure many teeth.\" He saw a sudden light come to the chief's eyes, but continued, \"I will send with you a sergeant of Houssas, that he may carry back to me the story of your prowess\"--the light died away again--\"for there will be many liars who will say that you never reached the Great Forest, and I shall have evidence to confound them.\"",
    "Four days out of M'Sakidanga, if native report be true, there is a trickling stream that meanders down from N'Gombi country. Native report says that this is navigable even in the dry season. The missionaries at Bonginda ridicule this report; and Arburt, the young chief of the station, with a gentle laugh in his blue eyes, listened one day to the report of Elebi about a fabulous land at the end of this river, and was kindly incredulous.\n\n\"If it be that ivory is stored in this place,\" he said in the vernacular, \"or great wealth lies for the lifting, go to Sandi, for this ivory belongs to the Government. But do you, Elebi, fix your heart more upon God's treasures in heaven, and your thoughts upon your unworthiness to merit a place in His kingdom, and let the ivory go.\"\n\nElebi was known to Sanders as a native evangelist of the tornado type, a thunderous, voluble sub-minister of the service; he had, in his ecstatic moments, made many converts. But there were days of reaction, when Elebi sulked in his mud hut, and reviewed Christianity calmly. It was a service, this new religion. You could not work yourself to a frenzy in it, and then have done with the thing for a week. You must needs go on, on, never tiring, never departing from the straight path, exercising irksome self-restraint, leaving undone that which you would rather do.\n\n\"Religion is prison,\" grumbled Elebi, after his interview, and shrugged his broad, black shoulders.\n\nIn his hut he was in the habit of discarding his European coat for the loin cloth and the blanket, for Elebi was a savage--an imitative savage--but still barbarian. Once, preaching on the River of Devils, he had worked himself up to such a pitch of enthusiastic fervour that he had smitten a scoffer, breaking his arm, and an outraged Sanders had him arrested, whipped, and fined a thousand rods. Hereafter Elebi had figured in certain English missionary circles as a Christian martyr, for he had lied magnificently, and his punishment had been represented as a form of savage persecution.\n\nBut the ivory lay buried three days' march beyond the Secret River; thus Elebi brooded over the log that smouldered in his hut day and night. Three days beyond the river, branching off at a place where there were two graves, the country was reputably full of devils, and Elebi shuddered at the thought; but, being a missionary and a lay evangelist, and, moreover, the proud possessor of a copy of the Epistle to the Romans (laboriously rendered into the native tongue), he had little to fear. He had more to fear from a certain White Devil at a far-away headquarters, who might be expected to range the lands of the Secret River, when the rains had come and gone.\n\nIt was supposed that Elebi had one wife, conforming to the custom of the white man, but the girl who came into the hut with a steaming bowl of fish in her hands was not the wife that the missionaries recognised as such.\n\n\"Sikini,\" he said, \"I am going a journey by canoe.\"\n\n\"In the blessed service?\" asked Sikini, who had come under the influence of the man in his more elated periods.\n\n\"The crackling of a fire is like a woman's tongue,\" quoted Elebi; \"and it is easier to keep the lid on a boiling pot than a secret in a woman's heart.\"\n\nElebi had the river proverbs at his finger-tips, and the girl laughed, for she was his favourite wife, and knew that in course of time the information would come to her.\n\n\"Sikini,\" said the man suddenly, \"you know that I have kept you when the Blood Taker would have me put you away.\" (Arburt had a microscope and spent his evenings searching the blood of his flock for signs of trynosomiasis.) \"You know that for your sake I lied to him who is my father and my protector, saying: 'There shall be but one wife in my house, and that Tombolo, the coast woman.'\"\n\nThe girl nodded, eyeing him stolidly.\n\n\"Therefore I tell you that I am going beyond the Secret River, three days' march, leaving the canoe at a place where there are two graves.\"\n\n\"What do you seek?\" she asked.\n\n\"There are many teeth in that country,\" he said; \"dead ivory that the people brought with them from a distant country, and have hidden, fearing one who is a Breaker of Stones. I shall come back rich, and buy many wives who shall wait upon you and serve you, and then I will no longer be Christian, but will worship the red fetish as my father did, and his father.\"\n\n\"Go,\" she said, nodding thoughtfully.\n\nHe told her many things that he had not revealed to Arburt--of how the ivory came, of the people who guarded it, of the means by which he intended to secure it. Next morning before the mission _lo-koli_ sounded, he had slipped away in his canoe; and Arburt, when the news came to him, sighed and called him a disappointing beggar--for Arburt was human. Sanders, who was also human, sent swift messengers to arrest Elebi, for it is not a good thing that treasure-hunting natives should go wandering through a strange country, such excursions meaning war, and war meaning, to Sanders at any rate, solemn official correspondence, which his soul loathed.",
    "When a man loves one woman, whether she be alive or dead, a deep and fragrant memory or a very pleasant reality, he is apt to earn the appellation of \"woman-hater,\" a hasty judgment which the loose-minded pass upon any man whose loves lack promiscuosity, and who does not diffuse his passions. Sanders was described as a woman-hater by such men who knew him sufficiently little to analyse his character, but Sanders was not a woman-hater in any sense of the word, for he bore no illwill toward woman kind, and certainly was innocent of any secret love.\n\nThere was a young man named Ludley who had been assistant to Sanders for three months, at the end of which time Sanders sent for him--he was stationed at Isisi City.\n\n\"I think you can go home,\" said Sanders.\n\nThe young man opened his eyes in astonishment.\n\n\"Why?\" he said.\n\nSanders made no reply, but stared through the open doorway at the distant village.\n\n\"Why?\" demanded the young man again.\n\n\"I've heard things,\" said Sanders shortly--he was rather uncomfortable, but did not show it.\n\n\"Things--like what?\"\n\nSanders shifted uneasily in his chair.\n\n\"Oh--things,\" he said vaguely, and added: \"You go home and marry that nice girl you used to rave about when you first came out.\"\n\nYoung Ludley went red under his tan.\n\n\"Look here, chief!\" he said, half angrily, half apologetically, \"you're surely not going to take any notice--you know it's the sort of thing that's done in black countries--oh, damn it all, you're not going to act as censor over my morals, are you?\"\n\nSanders looked at the youth coldly.\n\n\"Your morals aren't worth worrying about,\" he said truthfully. \"You could be the most depraved devil in the world--which I'll admit you aren't--and I should not trouble to reform you. No. It's the morals of my cannibals that worry me. Home you go, my son; get married, _crescit sub pondere virtus_--you'll find the translation in the foreign phrase department of any respectable dictionary. As to the sort of things that are done in black countries, they don't do them in our black countries--monkey tricks of that sort are good enough for the Belgian Congo, or for Togoland, but they aren't good enough for this little strip of wilderness.\"\n\nLudley went home. He did not tell anybody the real reason why he had come home, because it would not have sounded nice. He was a fairly decent boy, as boys of his type go, and he said nothing worse about Sanders than that he was a woman-hater.\n\nThe scene that followed his departure shows how little the white mind differs from the black in its process of working. For, after seeing his assistant safely embarked on a homeward-bound boat, Sanders went up the river to Isisi, and there saw a woman who was called M'Lino. The average black woman is ugly of face, but beautiful of figure, but M'Lino was no ordinary woman, as you shall learn. The Isisi people, who keep extraordinary records in their heads, the information being handed from father to son, say that M'Lino came from an Arabi family, and certainly if a delicately-chiselled nose, a refinement of lip, prove anything, they prove M'Lino came from no pure Bantu stock.\n\nShe came to Sanders when he sent for her, alert, suspicious, very much on her guard. Before he could speak, she asked him a question.\n\n\"Lord, where is Lijingii?\" This was the nearest the native ever got to the pronunciation of Ludley's name.\n\n\"Lijingii has gone across the black water,\" said Sanders gently, \"to his own people.\"\n\n\"You sent him, lord,\" she said quickly, and Sanders made no reply.\n\n\"Lord,\" she went on, and Sanders wondered at the bitterness in her tone, \"it is said that you hate women.\"\n\n\"Then a lie is told,\" said Sanders. \"I do not hate women; rather I greatly honour them, for they go down to the caves of hell when they bear children; also I regard them highly because they are otherwise brave and very loyal.\"\n\nShe said nothing. Her head was sunk till her chin rested on her bare, brown breast, but she looked at him from under her brows, and her eyes were filled with a strange luminosity. Something like a panic awoke in Sanders' heart--had the mischief been done? He cursed Ludley, and breathed a fervent, if malevolent, prayer that his ship would go down with him. But her words reassured him.\n\n\"I made Lijingii love me,\" she said, \"though he was a great lord, and I was a slave; I also would have gone down to hell, for some day I hoped I should bear him children, but now that can never be.\"\n\n\"And thank the Lord for it!\" said Sanders, under his breath. He would have given her some words of cheer, but she turned abruptly from him and walked away. Sanders watched the graceful figure as it receded down the straggling street, and went back to his steamer. He was ten miles down the river before he remembered that the reproof he had framed for the girl had been undelivered.\n\n\"That is very extraordinary,\" said Sanders, with some annoyance, \"I must be losing my memory.\"",
    "He had borrowed the Houssa signalling staff from headquarters, and stationed them at intervals along the river. On a still night the tapping of a drum carries far, but the rattle of iron-wood sticks on a hollowed tree-trunk carries farthest of all. \"Clok-clok, clockitty-clock.\" It sounded like the far-away croaking of a bull-frog; but Sanders picked out the letters: \"Devil Man sacrifices to-morrow night in the Forest of Dreams.\" As he jotted down the message on the white sleeve of his jacket, Abiboo came running up the path. \"I have heard,\" said Sanders briefly. \"There is steam in the _pucapuc_?\" \"We are ready, master,\" said the man. Sanders waited only to take a hanging revolver from the wall and throw his overcoat over his arm, for his travelling kit was already deposited on the _Zaire_, and had been for three days. In the darkness the sharp nose of his little boat swung out to the stream, and ten minutes after the message came the boat was threshing a way against the swift river. All night long the steamer went on, tacking from bank to bank to avoid the shoals. Dawn found her at a wooding, where her men, working at fever speed, piled logs on her deck until she had the appearance of a timber-boat. Then off again, stopping only to secure news of the coming sacrifice from the spies who were scattered up and down the river. Sanders reached the edge of the Dream Forest at midnight and tied up. He had ten Houssa policemen with him, and at the head of these he stepped ashore into the blackness of the forest. One of the soldiers went ahead to find the path and keep it, and in single file the little force began its two-hour march. Once they came upon two leopards fighting; once they stumbled over a buffalo sleeping in their path. Twice they disturbed strange beasts that slunk into the shadows as they passed, and came snuffling after them, till Sanders flashed a white beam from his electric lamp in their direction. Eventually they came stealthily to the place of sacrifice.\n\nThere were at least six hundred people squatting in a semi-circle before a rough altar built of logs. Two huge fires blazed and crackled on either side of the altar; but Sanders' eyes were for the Devil Man, who leant over the body of a young girl, apparently asleep, stretched upon the logs. Once the Devil Man had worn the garb of civilisation; now he was clothed in rags. He stood in his grimy shirt-sleeves, his white beard wild and uncombed, his pale face tense, and a curious light in his eyes. In his hand was a bright scalpel, and he was speaking--and, curiously enough, in English. \"This, gentlemen,\" said he, leaning easily against the rude altar, and speaking with the assurance of one who had delivered many such lectures, \"is a bad case of trynosomiasis. You will observe the discoloration of skin, the opalescent pupils, and now that I have placed the patient under anaesthetics you will remark the misplacement of the cervical glands, which is an invariable symptom.\" He paused and looked benignly around. \"I may say that I have lived for a great time amongst native people. I occupied the honourable position of witch-doctor in Central Africa----\" He stopped and passed his hand across his brow, striving to recall something; then he picked up the thread of his discourse. All the time he spoke the half-naked assembly sat silent and awe-stricken, comprehending nothing save that the witch-doctor with the white face, who had come from nowhere and had done many wonderful things--his magic box proved to be a galvanic battery--was about to perform strange rites. \"Gentlemen,\" the old man went on, tapping the breast of his victim with the handle of his scalpel, \"I shall make an incision----\"\n\nSanders came from his place of concealment, and walked steadily towards the extemporised operating-table. \"Professor,\" he said gently, and the madman looked at him with a puzzled frown. \"You are interrupting the clinic,\" he said testily; \"I am demonstrating----\" \"I know, sir.\" Sanders took his arm, and Sir George Carsley, a great scientist, consulting surgeon to St. Mark's Hospital, London, and the author of many books on tropical diseases, went with him like a child.",
    "By the little river that turns abruptly from the River of Spirits, Imgani, the Lonely One, built a house. He built it in proper fashion, stealing the wood from a village five miles away. In this village there had been many deaths, owing to The Sickness; and it is the custom on the Upper River that whenever a person dies, the house wherein he died shall die also. No man takes shelter under the accursed roof whereunder the Spirit sits brooding; the arms of the dead man are broken and scattered on his shallow grave, and the cooking-pots of his wives are there likewise. By and by, under the combined influences of wind and rain, the reed roof sags and sinks, the doorposts rot; elephant-grass, coarse and strong, shoots up between crevices in wall and roof; then come a heavier rain and a heavier wind, and the forest has wiped the foul spot clean. Imgani, who said he was of the N'Gombi people, and was afraid of no devils--at any rate, no Isisi devil--stole doorposts and native rope fearlessly. He stole them by night, when the moon was behind the trees, and mocked the dead spirits, calling them by evil and tantalising names. Yet he went cautiously to work; for whilst he did not hold spirits in account, he was wholesomely respectful of the live Isisi, who would have put him to death had his sacrilege been detected, though, strangely enough, death was the thing he feared least. So he stole the accursed supports and accursed roof-props, and would have stolen the roofs as well, but for the fact that they were very old and full of spiders. All these things he came and took, carrying them five miles to the turn of the river, and there, at his leisure, he built a little house. In the daytime he slept, in the night he trapped beasts and caught fish, but he made no attempt to catch the big bats that come over from the middle island of the river, though these are very edible, and regarded as a delicacy.\n\nOne day, just before the sun went down, he went into the forest on the track of zebra. He carried two big hunting-spears, such as the N'Gombi make best; a wickerwork shield, and on his back, slung by a strip of hide, a bunch of dried fish he had caught in the river. A man of middle height was Imgani, spare of build, but broad of shoulder. His skin shone healthily, and his step was light. As he walked, you saw the muscles of his back ripple and weave like the muscles of a well-trained thoroughbred. He was half an hour's journey within the forest, when he came upon a girl. She was carrying a bundle of manioc root on her head, and walked gracefully. When she saw Imgani she stopped dead, and the fear of death and worse came in her eyes, for she knew him to be an outcast man, with no tribe and no people. Such men are more dreadful than the ingali, who rears up from the grass and plunges his poison-fangs in your leg. They stood watching one another, the man leaning with both hands on the spears, his cheek against them; the girl trembled. \"Woman, where do you go?\" said Imgani. \"Master, I go to the village which is by the river, this being the path,\" she flurried. \"What have you there?\" \"Manioc, for bread,\" she whispered thickly. \"You are a root-eater,\" said Imgani, nodding his head. \"Master, let me go,\" she said, staring at him. Imgani jerked his head. \"I see you are afraid of me--yet I want nothing from you,\" he said. \"I am Imgani, which means the Lonely One; and I have no desire for wives or women, being too high a man for such folly. You are safe, root-eater, for if I wished I would fill this forest with the daughters of chiefs, all very beautiful, all moaning for me.\" The girl's fear had disappeared, and she looked at him curiously. Moreover, she recognised that there was truth in his claim of austerity. Possibly she was a little piqued, for she said tartly enough, employing an Isisi proverb: \"Only the goat bleats at the mouth of the leopard's cave--the Isisi grow fat on strangers.\" He looked at her, his head cocked on one side. \"They say in the lower country that the Isisi sell men to the Arabi,\" he said musingly. \"That is bad talk; you may go.\" With another jerk of his head he dismissed her.\n\nShe had gone some little distance when he called her back. \"Root-eater,\" he said, \"if men ask you who I be, you shall say that I am Imgani the Lonely One, who is a prince amongst the princes; also that I have killed many men in my day--so many that I cannot count them. Also say that from my house, which I have built by the river, to as far as a man can see in every way, is my kingdom, and let none stray therein, except to bring gifts in their hands, for I am very terrible and very jealous.\" \"Lord,\" said the girl, \"I will say all this.\" And she went, half running, in the direction of the village, leaving Imgani to continue on his way.",
    "Sanders had no special regard for missionaries; indeed, he had views on the brotherhood which did him no particular credit, but he had an affection for the young man who laboured so cheerfully with such unpromising material, and now he paced the little bridge of his steamer impatiently, for it was very necessary that he should reach Tukalala before certain things happened. He came round a bend of the little river just as the sun was going down behind the trees on the western bank, and the white beach before the mission station showed clearly. He motioned with two fingers to the man at the wheel, and the little steamer swung almost broadside to the swift stream and headed for the bank, and the black water of the river humped up against his port bow as though it were a sluice gate. Into the beach he steamed; \"pucka-pucka-pucka-puck,\" sang the stern wheel noisily. Where the missionary's house had stood was a chaos of blackened debris, and out of it rose lazy little wisps of smoke. He found the missionary dressed in white duck, greatly soiled, lying face downwards, and he found some difficulty in raising him, because he was pinned to the ground with a broad-bladed elephant spear which had been broken off flush with his shoulders. Sanders turned him on his back, closed the patient's eyes, staring, it seemed, hungrily at the darkening sky as though at the last questioning God's wisdom. The Commissioner took a gaudy bandana handkerchief from his pocket, and laid it on the dead man's face. \"Abiboo,\" he said softly to his sergeant, \"dig me a great hole by that copal gum, for this man was a great chief amongst his people, and had communion with gods.\" \"He was a Christ man,\" said Abiboo sagely, who was a devout follower of the Prophet, \"and in the Sura of Mary it is written: \"'The sects have fallen to variance about Jesus, but woe, because of the assembly of a great day to those who believe not!'\" Abiboo bore the title of Haj because he had been to Mecca and knew the Koran better than most Christians know the Bible.\n\nSanders said nothing. He took a cigar from his pocket and lit it, casting his eyes around. No building stood. Where the mission station with its trim garden had been, was desolation. He saw scraps of cloth in the fading light. These were other victims, he knew. In the mellow light of the moon he buried the missionary, saying the Lord's Prayer over him, and reciting as much of the Burial Service as he could remember. Then he went back to the _Zaire_ and set a guard. In the morning Sanders turned the nose of the _Zaire_ down stream, and at sunset came to the big river--he had been sailing a tributary--and where the two rivers meet is the city of the Akasava. They brought the paramount chief of all the people to him, and there was a palaver on the little bridge with a lantern placed on the deck and one limp candle therein to give light to the assembly. \"Chief,\" said Sanders, \"there is a dead white man in your territory, and I will have the hearts of the men who killed him, or by The Death I will have your head.\" He said this evenly, without passion, yet he swore by _Ewa_, which means death and is a most tremendous oath. The chief, squatting on the deck, fidgeting with his hands, shivered. \"Lord,\" he said, in a cracked voice, \"this is a business of which I know nothing; this thing has happened in my territory, but so far from my hand that I can neither punish nor reward.\" Sanders was silent save for an unsympathetic sniff. \"Also, master,\" said the chief, \"if the truth be told, this palaver is not of the Akasava alone, for all along the big river men are rebellious, obeying a new ju-ju more mighty than any other.\" \"I know little of ju-jus,\" said Sanders shortly, \"only I know that a white man has died and his spirit walks abroad and will not rest until I have slain men. Whether it be you or another I do not care--the palaver is finished.\" The chief rose awkwardly, brought up his hand in salute, and went shuffling down the sloping plank to land. As for Sanders, he sat thinking, smoking one cigar after another. He sat long into the night. Once he called his servant to replace the candle in the lantern and bring him a cushion for his head. He sat there until the buzzing little village hushed to sleep, until there was no sound but the whispering of bat wings as they came and went from the middle island--for bats love islands, especially the big vampire bats. At two o'clock in the morning he looked at his watch, picked up the lantern, and walked aft. He picked a way over sleeping men until he came to that part of the deck where a Houssa squatted with loaded carbine watching the two prisoners."

  "Talbot Mundy -- Affair in Araby": [
    "Whoever invented chess understood the world's works as some men know clocks and watches. He recognized a fact and based a game on it, with the result that his game endures. And what he clearly recognized was this: That no king matters much as long as your side is playing a winning game. You can leave your king in his corner then to amuse himself in dignified unimportance. But the minute you begin to lose, your king becomes a source of anxiety.\n\nIn what is called real life (which is only a great game, although a mighty good one) it makes no difference what you call your king. Call him Pope if you want to, or President, or Chairman. He grows in importance in proportion as the other side develops the attack. You've got to keep your symbol of authority protected or you lose.\n\nNevertheless, your game is not lost as long as your king can move. That's why the men who want to hurry up and start a new political era imprison kings and cut their heads off. With no head on his shoulders your king can only move in the direction of the cemetery, which is over the line and doesn't count.\n\nI love a good fight, and have been told I ought to be ashamed of it. I've noticed, though, that the folk who propose to elevate my morals fight just as hard, and less cleanly, with their tongue than some of us do with our fists and sinews. I'm told, too, quite frequently that as an American I ought to be ashamed of fighting for a king. Dear old ladies of both sexes have assured me that it isn't moral to give aid and comfort to a gallant gentleman--a godless Mohammedan, too; which makes it much worse--who is striving gamely and without malice to keep his given word and save his country.\n\nBut if you've got all you want, do you know of any better fun than lending a hand while some man you happen to like gets his? I don't. Of course, some fellows want too much, and it's bad manners as well as waste of time to inflict your opinion on them. But given a reasonable purpose and a friend who needs your assistance, is there any better sport on earth than risking your own neck to help him put it over?\n\nWalk wide of the man and particularly of the woman, who makes a noise about lining your pocket or improving your condition. An altruist is my friend James Schuyler Grim, but he makes less noise than a panther on a dark night; and I never knew a man less given to persuading you. He has one purpose, but almost never talks about it. It's a sure bet that if we hadn't struck up a close friendship, sounding each other out carefully as opportunity occurred, I would have been in the dark about it until this minute.\n\nAll the news of Asia from Alexandretta to the Persian Gulf and from Northern Turkestan to South Arabia reaches Grim's ears sooner or later. He earns his bread and butter knitting all that mess of cross-grained information into one intelligible pattern; after which he interprets it and acts suddenly without advance notices.\n\nTime and again, lone-handed, he has done better than an army corps, by playing chief against chief in a land where the only law is individual interpretation of the Koran.\n\nBut it wasn't until our rescue of Jeremy Ross from near Abu Kem, that I ever heard Grim come out openly and admit that he was working to establish Feisul, third son of the King of Mecca, as king of just as many Arabs as might care to have him over them. That was the cat he had been keeping in a bag for seven years.\n\nRight down to the minute when Grim, Jeremy and I sat down with Ben Saoud the Avenger on a stricken field at Abu Kem, and Grim and Jeremy played their hands so cleverly that the Avenger was made, unwitting guardian of Jeremy's secret gold-mine, and Feisul's open and sworn supporter in the bargain, the heart of Grim's purpose continued to be a mystery even to me; and I have been as intimate with him as any man.\n\nHe doles out what he has in mind as grudgingly as any Scot spends the shillings in his purse. But the Scots are generous when they have to be, and so is Grim. There being nothing else for it on that occasion, he spilled the beans, the whole beans, and nothing but the beans. Having admitted us two to his secret, he dilated on it all the way back to Jerusalem, telling us all he knew of Feisul (which would fill a book), and growing almost lyrical at times as he related incidents in proof of his contention that Feisul, lineal descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, is the \"whitest\" Arab and most gallant leader of his race since Saladin.\n\nKnowing Grim and how carefully suppressed his enthusiasm usually is, I couldn't help being fired by all he said on that occasion.\n\nAnd as for Jeremy, well--it was like meat and drink to him. You meet men more or less like Jeremy Ross in any of earth's wild places, although you rarely meet his equal for audacity, irreverence and riotous good-fellowship. He isn't the only Australian by a long shot who upholds Australia by fist and boast and astounding gallantry, yet stays away from home. You couldn't fix Jeremy with concrete; he'd find some means of bursting any mould.\n\nHe had been too long lost in the heart of Arabia for anything except the thought of Sydney Bluffs and the homesteads that lie beyond to tempt him for the first few days.",
    "Like most of the quarters occupied by British officers, the house occupied by Major Roger Ticknor and his wife Mabel was \"enemy property,\" and its only virtue consisted in its being rent free. Grim, Jeremy, little Ticknor and his smaller wife, and I sat facing across a small deal table with a stuttering oil-lamp between us. In a house not far away some Orthodox Jews, arrayed in purple and green and orange, with fox-fur around the edges of their hats, were drunk and celebrating noisily the Feast of Esther; so you can work out the exact date if you're curious enough. The time was nine p.m. We had talked the Anzac hurricane-drive through Palestine all over again from the beginning, taking world-known names in vain and doing honour to others that will stay unsung for lack of recognition, when one of those unaccountable pauses came, and for the sake of breaking silence, Mabel Ticknor asked a question. She was a little, plucky, pale-faced thing whom you called instinctively by her first name at the end of half an hour--a sort of little mother of loose-ended men, who can make silk purses out of sows' ears, and wouldn't know how to brag if she were tempted.\n\n\"Say, Jim,\" she asked, turning her head quickly like a bird toward Grim on my left, \"what's your verdict about that man from Syria that Roger took in a cab to the Sikh hospital? I'm out a new pair of riding breeches if Roger has to pay the bill for him. I want my money's worth. Tell me his story.\"\n\n\"Go ahead and buy the breeches, Mabel. I'll settle that bill,\" he answered.\n\n\"No, you won't, Jim! You're always squandering money. Half your pay goes to the scallywags you've landed in jail. This one's up to Roger and me; we found him.\"\n\nGrim laughed.\n\n\"I can charge his keep under the head of 'information paid for.' I shall sign the voucher without a qualm.\"\n\n\"You'd get blood out of a stone, Jim! Go on, tell us!\"\n\n\"I'm hired to keep secrets as well as discover them,\" Grim answered, smiling broadly.\n\n\"Of course you are,\" she retorted. \"But I know all Roger's secrets, and he's a doctor, mind you! Am I right, Roger? Come along! There are no servants--no eavesdroppers. Wait. I'll put tea on the table, and then we'll all listen.\"\n\nShe made tea Australian fashion in a billy, which is quick and simple, but causes alleged dyspepsia cures to sell well all the way from Adelaide to the Gulf of Carpentraia.\n\n\"You'll have to tell her, Jim,\" said Jeremy.\n\n\"Mabel's safe as an iron roof,\" put in her husband. \"Noisy in the rain, but doesn't leak.\"\n\nBut neither man nor woman could have extracted a story from James Schuyler Grim unless it suited him to tell it. Mabel Ticknor is one of those honest little women who carry men's secrets with them up and down the world. Being confided in by nearly every man who met her was a habit. But Grim tells only when the telling may accomplish something, and I wondered, as he laid his elbow on the table to begin, just what use he meant to make of Mabel Ticknor. He uses what he knows as other level-headed men use coin, spending thriftily for fair advantage.\n\n\"That is secret,\" he began, as soon as Mabel had dumped the contents of the billy into a huge brown teapot. \"I expect Narayan Singh here presently. He'll have a letter with him, taken from the Syrian who stabbed that man in the hospital.\"\n\n\"Whoa, hoss!\" Jeremy interrupted. \"You mean you've sent that Sikh to get the shirt of Yussuf Dakmar?\"\n\nGrim nodded.\n\n\"That was my job,\" Jeremy objected.\n\n\"Whoa, hoss, yourself, Jeremy!\" Grim answered. \"You'd have gone down into the bazaar like a bull into a china-shop. Narayan Singh knows where to find him. If he shows fight, he'll be simply handed over to the Sikh patrol for attacking a man in uniform, and by the time he reaches the lock-up that letter will be here on the table between us.\"\n\n\"All the same, that's a lark you've done me out of,\" Jeremy insisted. \"That Yussuf Dakmar's a stinker. I know all about him. Two whole squadrons had to eat lousy biscuit for a week because that swab sold the same meat five times over. But I'll get him yet!\"\n\n\"Well, as I was saying,\" Grim resumed, \"there's a letter in Jerusalem that's supposed to be from Feisul. But when Feisul writes anything he signs his name to it, whereas a number is the signature on this. Now that fellow Sidi bin Tagim in the hospital is an honest old kite in his way. He's a great rooter for Feisul. And the only easy way to ditch a man like Feisul, who's as honest as the day is long, and no man's fool, is to convince his fanatical admirers that for his own sake he ought to be forced along a certain course. The game's as old as Adam. You fill up a man like Sidi bin Tagim with tales about Jews--convince him that Jews stand between Feisul and a kingdom--and he'll lend a hand in any scheme ostensibly directed against Jews. Get me?\"",
    "Sahib, in accordance with instructions I proceeded to Christian Street to the place you spoke of, where I found Yussuf Dakmar drinking coffee and smoking in company with these men and others. They did not see me in the beginning, because I entered by the door of a house threescore and five paces farther down the street; and having by that means gained the roof I descended to a gallery built of stone above one end of the coffee-shop, and there lay concealed among evil-smelling bags.\n\n\"They conversed in Arabic; and presently when other men had entered, some of whose names I overheard and wrote down on this slip of paper, Yussuf Dakmar locked the outer door, turning the great key twice and setting a chain in place as well. Then he stood on a red stool having four short legs, with his back to the door that he had locked, and spoke in the manner of one who stirs a multitude, gesticulating greatly.\n\n\"The argument he made was thus: He said that Jerusalem is a holy city, and Palestine a holy land; and that promises are all the more sacred if given in connection with religious matters; whereat they all applauded greatly. Nevertheless, a little later on he mocked at all religion, and they applauded that too. He said that the Allies, persuaded thereto by the British, had made a promise to the Emir Feisul on the strength of which the Arabs made common war with the Allies against the Turks and Germans, losing of their own a hundred thousand men and untold money.\n\n\"So, sahib. Next he asked them how much of that promise made by the Allies to Emir Feisul as the leader of the Arabs had been kept, or was likely to be kept; and they answered in one voice, 'None of it!' Whereat he nodded, as a teacher nods gravely when the pupils have their lesson well by heart, and said presently in a voice like that of a Guru denouncing sin: 'A woman's promise is a little matter; who believes it? When it is broken all men laugh. A promise extorted under threat or torture is not binding, since he who made the promise was not free to govern his own conduct; that is law. A promise made in business,' said he, 'is a contract contingent on circumstances and subject to litigation. But a promise made in wartime by a nation is a pledge set down in letters of blood. Whoever breaks it is guilty of blood; and whoever fails to smite dead the breaker of that oath, commits treason against Allah!'\n\n\"They applauded that speech greatly, sahib, and when they grew silent he bade them look about and judge for themselves at whose door the breaking of that sacred promise really lay. 'Show me,' said he, 'one trace of Arab government in all Palestine. Who owns the land?' he asked them. 'Arabs!' said they. 'Yet to whom has the country been given?' he shouted. 'To the Jews!' they answered; and he grew silent for a while, like a teacher whose class has only given half the answer to a question until presently one man growled out, 'To the sword with the Jews in the name of Allah!' and the others echoed that which satisfied him, for he smiled, nevertheless not using those words himself. And presently he continued:\n\n\"'We in this room are men of enlightenment. We are satisfied to leave past and future to speculations of idle dreamers. For us the present. So we attach no value to the fact that Feisul is descended in a straight line from the founder of the Moslem faith; for that is a superstition as foolish in its way as Christianity or any other creed. But who is there like Feisul who can unite all Arabs under one banner?'\n\n\"They answered, sahib, that Feisul is the only living man who can accomplish that, making many assertions in his praise, Yussuf Dakmar nodding approval as each spoke. 'Yet,' said he when they had finished, 'Feisul is also fallible. In certain ways he is a fool, and principally in this: That he insists on keeping his own promises to men who have broken their own promises to him.' And like pupils in a class who recite their lesson, they all murmured that such a course as that is madness.\n\n\"'So,' said he, 'we are clear on that point. We are not altruists, nor religious fanatics, nor slaves, but men of common sense who have a business in view. We are not Feisul's servants, but he ours. We make use of him, not he of us. If he persists in a wrong course, we must force him into the right one, for the day of autocratic government is past and the hour has come when those who truly represent the people have the first right to direct all policy. If the right is still withheld from them, they must take it. And it is we in this room who truly represent the Arab cause, on whom lies the responsibility of forcing Feisul's hand!'\"\n\nOur three prisoners were listening to the recitation spellbound, and so were we all for that matter. The mere memory feat was amazing enough. Few men could listen in hiding to a stranger's words, and report them exactly after an interval of more than an hour; but Narayan Singh did better than that, for he reproduced the speaker's gesture and inflexion, so that we had a mental picture of the scene that he described. Mabel offered him stewed tannic acid in the name of tea, and Ticknor suggested a chair, but he waved both offers aside and continued as if the picture before his mind and the words he was remembering might escape him if he took things easy.",
    "\"It isn't in Feisul's handwriting,\" he said, holding the feathery Arab script up to the lamplight; \"and it's no more like his phraseology than a camel resembles a locomotive. Listen to this:\n\nTo the Pan-Arab Committee in Jerusalem, by favour of Yussuf Dakmar Bey its District President, Greeting in the name of God:\n\nYe know that on former occasions the foes of our land and race were overwhelmed when, relying on the aid of the Most High, and raising the green banner of the Prophet--on whom be peace--we launched our squadrons in a cause held sacred by us all. Ye know that in that fashion, and not otherwise, the accursed conquerors were driven forth and our sacred banner was set on high over the Damascus roofs, where by Allah's blessing may it wave for ever! Ye know how those who claimed to be our friends have since proven themselves foes, so that the independent state for which we fought is held today in ignominious subjection by aliens, who deny the true Faith and hold their promises as nothing. Ye know how Damascus is beset by the French, and Palestine is held by the British who, notwithstanding the oath they swore to us, are daily betraying us Arabs to the Jews. Know now, then, that the hour has struck when, again in the name of Allah, we must finish what we formerly began and with our true swords force these infidels to yield our country to us. Nor on this occasion shall we sheathe our swords until from end to end our land is free and united under one government of our own choosing. Know that this time there shall be no half-measures nor any compromise. It is written, Ye shall show no quarter to the infidel. Let no Jew live to boast that he has footing in the land of our ancestors. Leave ye no root of them in the earth nor seedling that can spring into a tree! Smite, and smite swiftly in the name of Him who never sleeps, who keeps all promises, whose almighty hand is ready to preserve the Faithful. Whereunto ye are bidden to take courage. Whereunto our army of Syria stands ready. Whereunto the day has been appointed. Know ye that the tenth day from the sending of this letter, and at dawn, is the appointed time. Therefore let all make common cause for the favour of the Most High which awaits the Faithful. In the name of God and Mohammed the Prophet of God, on whom be blessings.\"\n\n\nThere followed the Moslem date and the numerical signature over Feisul's indubitable seal. Grim figured a moment and worked out the corresponding date according to our western calendar.\n\n\"Leaves six days,\" he said pleasantly. \"It means the French intend to attack Damascus seven days from now.\"\n\n\"Let 'em!\" Jeremy exploded. \"Feisul'll give 'em ----! All they've got are Algerians.\"\n\n\"The French have poison gas,\" Grim answered dourly. \"Feisul's men have no masks.\"\n\n\"Get 'em some!\"\n\nThat was Jeremy again. Grim didn't answer, but went on talking:\n\n\"They're going to get Damascus. All they've waited for was poison gas, and now there's no stopping 'em. They forged this letter after the gas arrived. Now if they catch Feisul in Damascus they'll put him on trial for his life, and they probably hope to get this letter back somehow to use as evidence against him.\"\n\n\"Go slow, Jim!\" Mabel objected. \"Where's your proof that the French are jockeying this? Isn't that Feisul's seal?\"\n\n\"Yes, and it's his paper. But not his handwriting.\"\n\n\"He might have dictated it, mightn't he?\"\n\n\"Never in those words. Feisul don't talk or write that way. The letter's a manifest forgery, as I'll prove by confronting Feisul with it. But there's a little oversight that should convince you it's a forgery. Have you a magnifying glass, doc?\"\n\nTicknor produced one in a minute, and Grim held the letter under the lamp. On the rather wide margin, carefully rubbed out, but not so carefully that the indentation did not show, was the French word magnifique that had been written with a rather heavy hand and one of those hard pencils supplied to colonial governments by exporters from stocks that can't be sold at home.\n\n\"That proves nothing,\" Mabel insisted. \"All educated Arabs talk French. Somebody on Feisul's staff was asked for an opinion on the letter before it went. My husband's Arab orderly told me only yesterday that a sling I made for a man in the hospital was magnifique.\"\n\nThe objection was well enough taken, because it was the sort the forger of the letter would be likely to raise if brought to book. But Grim's argument was not exhausted.\n\n\"There are other points, Mabel. For one thing, it's blue metallic ink. Feisul's private letters are all written with indelible black stuff made from pellets that I gave him; they're imported from the States.\"\n\n\"But if Feisul wanted to prove an alibi, he naturally wouldn't use his special private ink,\" objected Mabel.\n\n\"Then why his seal, and his special private notepaper? However, there's another point. Feisul writes the purest kind of Arabic, and this isn't that sort of Arabic. It was written by a foreigner--perhaps a Frenchman--possibly an Armenian--most likely a Turk--certainly one of the outer ring of politicians who have access to Feisul and seek to control him, but are not really in his confidence. Damascus is simply a network of spies of that kind--men who attached themselves to the Arab cause when it looked like winning and are now busy transferring their allegiance. I think I could name the man who wrote this; I think I know the man who wrote that magnifique. If I'm right, Yussuf Dakmar will notify the French tonight through their agents in Jerusalem. The man who wrote that magnifique will know before morning that the letter's missing; and it doesn't matter how careful I may be, it'll be known as soon as I start for Damascus. They'll dope out that our obvious course would be to confront Feisul with this letter. The only way to travel is by train; the roads are rotten--in fact, no auto could get through; they'd tip off the Bedouins, who'd murder everybody. So they'll watch the trains and especially Haifa, where everyone going north has to spend the night; and they'll stop at nothing to get the letter back, for two reasons; as long as it's in our hands it can be used to establish proof of the plot against Feisul; once it's back in theirs, they can keep it in their secret dossier to use against Feisul if they ever catch him and bring him to trial. You remember the Dreyfus case? I shall start for Damascus by the early train--probably take an auto as far as Ludd. If I want to live until I reach Damascus I shall have to prove conclusively that I haven't that letter with me. Anyone known to be in British service is going to be suspected and, if not murdered, robbed. Ramsden has been seen about too much with me. Jeremy might juggle by but he's already notorious, and these people are shrewd. Better hold Jeremy in reserve, and the same with Narayan Singh. A woman's best. How about you, Mabel?\"\n\n\"What d'you mean, Jim?\"\n\n\"Do you know a woman in Haifa?\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"Well enough to expect a bed for the night at a moment's notice?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nMabel's eyes were growing very bright indeed. It was her husband who looked alarmed.",
    "There were three men there. Grim was talking to the other two.\n\n\"Keep your hands on each other's shoulders! Don't move! I'm going to search all your pockets again. Now, Mr. Charkian. Ah! That feels like quite a pretty little weapon; mother o' pearl on the butt? Have you a permit? Never mind; not having the weapon you won't need a permit, will you? And papers--Mashallah! What a lot of documents; they must be highly important ones since you hide them under your shirt. I expect you planned to sell them, eh? Too bad! Too bad! You keep your hands on Mr. Charkian's shoulders, Yussuf Dakmar, or I'll have to use violence! I'm not sure, Mr. Charkian, that it wouldn't be kinder to society to send you to jail after all; you need a bath so badly. It seems a pity that a chief clerk to the Administration shouldn't have a chance to wash himself, doesn't it? Well, I'll have to read these papers afterward--after we've usurped the prerogative of Destiny and mapped out a little of the future. Now--are you both listening? Do you know who I am?\"\n\nThere was no answer. \"You, Mr. Charkian?\"\n\n\"I think you are Major Grim.\"\n\n\"Ah! You wish to flatter me, don't you? Never mind; let us pretend I'm Major Grim disguised as an Arab; only, I'm afraid we must continue the conversation in Arabic; I might disillusion you if I tried to talk English. We'll say then that I'm Major Grim, disguised. Let's see now... What would he do in the circumstances? Here's Yussuf Dakmar, wanted for murder in the city and known to be plotting a massacre, seen climbing a wall when the sentry's back was turned, and caught in conference with Mr. Charkian, confidential clerk to the Administration. I'm sorry I didn't hear all that was said at your conference, for that might have made it easier to guess what Major Grim would do.\"\n\n\"Don't play with us like a cat playing with a mouse!\" snarled somebody. \"Tell us what you want. If you were Major Grim you'd have handed us over to those officers who passed just now. You're just as much irregular as we are. Hurry up and make your bargain, or the guard may come and arrest us all!\"\n\n\"Yes, hurry up!\" complained the other man. \"I don't want to be caught here; and as for those papers you have taken, if we are caught I shall say you stole them from the office--you and Yussuf Dakmar, and that I followed you to recover them, and you both attacked me!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Grim's voice pleasantly. \"I'll let you go. I think you're dangerous. You'd better be quick, because I think I hear the guard coming!\"\n\n\"Give me back the papers, then!\"\n\n\"Aha! Will you wait and discuss them with the guard, or go at once?\"\n\nThe Armenian clerk didn't answer, but got up and slunk away.\n\n\"Why did you let that fool go?\" demanded Yussuf Dakmar. \"Now he will awaken some officer and start hue and cry with a story that we robbed him. Listen! There comes the guard! We had better both run!\"\n\n\"Not so fast!\" Grim answered.\n\nAnd then he raised his voice perceptibly, as if he wished to be overheard:\n\n\"I think those men who passed just now were not officers at all. Perhaps they were strangers. It may be that one of them is confused, and is leading the guard in the wrong direction!\"\n\n\"Don't make so much noise then!\" retorted Yussuf Dakmar. Jeremy, who thinks habitually about ten times as fast as I do, slipped away at once into the shadows to find Narayan Singh and decoy the guard elsewhere. I didn't envy him the job, for Sikhs use cold steel first and argue afterward when on the qui vive in the dark. However, he accomplished his purpose. Narayan Singh saved his life, and the guard arrested him on general principles. You could hear both Jeremy and Narayan Singh using Grim's name freely. Yussuf Dakmar wasn't deaf. He gave tongue:\n\n\"There! Did you hear that? They are speaking of Major Grim. You are a fool if you wait here any longer. That fellow Grim is a devil, I tell you. If he finds us we are both lost!\"\n\n\"We have to be found first,\" Grim answered, and you could almost hear him smile.\n\n\"Quick then! What do you want?\" snapped Yussuf Dakmar. Grim's answer was the real surprise of the evening. It bewildered me as much as it astonished Yussuf Dakmar.\n\n\"I want that letter that came from the Emir Feisul!\"",
    "Yussuf Dakmar assessed all other humans as grist for his mill. Character to him was expressed in degrees of folly and sheer badness. Virtue existed only as a weakness to be exploited. The question that always exercised him was, wherein does the other fellow's weakness lie? It's a form of madness. Where a sane man looks for strength and honesty that he can yoke up with, a Yussuf Dakmar spies out human failings; and whereas most of us in our day have mistaken pyrites for fine gold, which did not hurt more than was good for us, he ends by mistaking gold for dross.\n\nYou can persuade such a man without the slightest difficulty that you are a fool and a crook. Jeremy had turned the trick for his own amusement as much as anything, although his natural vein of shrewdness probably suggested the idea. Yussuf Dakmar, ready to believe all evil and no good of anyone, was convinced that he had to deal with a scatter-brained Arab who could be used for almost any purpose, and Jeremy's riotous bent for jumping from one thing to another fixed the delusion still more firmly.\n\nBut Lord, he had caught a Tartar! Outside at the end of the corridor, in full view, but out of earshot, of Narayan Singh, Yussuf Dakmar made a proposal to Jeremy that was almost perfect in its naive obliquity. There was nothing original or even unusual about it, except the circumstances, time and place. Green-goods men and blue-sky stock salesmen, race-course touts and sure-thing politicians get away with the same proposition in the U.S. every day of the week, and pocket millions by it. Only, just as happens to all such gentry on occasion, Yussuf Dakmar had the wrong fish in his net.\n\nHe jerked his head toward where Narayan Singh sat stolid and sleepy-looking on a camp-stool with his curly black beard resting on the heel of one hand.\n\n\"Do you know that man?\" he asked.\n\n\"Wallah! How should I know him?\" Jeremy answered. \"He looks like a Hindu thinking of reincarnation. Inshallah, he will turn into a tiger presently!\"\n\n\"Beware of him! He is an Administration spy. He is watching me talk to you, and perhaps he will ask you afterward what I have said. You must be very careful how you answer him.\"\n\n\"I will tell him you asked me for a love-potion for the engine-driver's wife,\" Jeremy answered.\n\n\"I am listening. What is it you are really going to say?\"\n\n\"That master of yours--that Ramsden, who dismissed you so tyrannically just now--\"\n\n\"That drunkard? There is nothing interesting to be said about him,\" Jeremy answered. \"He is a fool who has paid my fare as far as Damascus. May Allah reward him for it!\"\n\n\"Are you telling me the truth?\" demanded Yussuf Dakmar, fixing his eyes sternly on Jeremy's.\n\nYour con man never overlooks a chance to put his intended victim on the defensive at an early stage in the proceedings. \"How can he have paid your fare as far as Damascus? This line only goes to Haifa, where you have to change trains and buy another ticket.\"\n\n\"I see you are a clever devil,\" Jeremy retorted. \"May Allah give you a belly ache, if that is where you keep your brains! It was I who bought the tickets. The fool gave me sufficient money for three first-class fares all the way to Damascus, and I have the change. He forgot that when he dismissed me.\"\n\n\"Then you won't need to beg board and lodging in Haifa?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I need my money for another matter. It is high time I married, and a fellow without money has to put up with any toothless that nobody else will take.\"\n\n\"So you hope to find a wife in Damascus?\"\n\n\"Inshallah,\" Jeremy answered piously.\n\n\"Well, I will find you a good-looking girl for wife, provided you first prove that you will make a good son-in-law. I take men as I find them, not as they represent themselves. He who wishes for the fire must first chop wood. You understand me?\"\n\n\"Wallah! I can chop wood like an axe with two heads. Is the woman your daughter?\"\n\n\"That is as may be. Let us talk business. I reward my friends, but woe betide the fool who betrays my confidence!\" said Yussuf Dakmar darkly.",
    "I had made the fourth or fifth turn when Narayan Singh came out and accosted me under the lamplight. \"Pardon,\" he called aloud in English, \"does the sahib know where I can find a druggist's open at this hour? I have a toothache and need medicine.\"\n\n\"Come and I'll show you a place,\" said I with the patronizing air of a tourist showing off his knowledge, and we strode along together down the street, he holding one hand to his jaw.\n\n\"Thus and so it happened, sahib,\" he began as soon as we had gone a safe distance. \"I lay sleeping, having kept my belly empty that I might wake easily. There came Yussuf Dakmar and five men brushing by me, and they all went into a room four doors beyond the sahib's. The room next beyond that one is occupied by an officer sahib, who fought at El-Arish alongside my battalion. Between him and me is a certain understanding based on past happenings in which we both had a hand. He is not as some other sahibs, but a man who opens both ears and his heart, and when I knocked on his door he opened it and recognized me.\n\n\"'Well?' said he. 'Why not come and see me in the morning?\n\n\"'Sahib,' said I, 'for the sake of El-Arish, let me in quickly, and close the door!'\n\n\"So he did, wondering and not pleased to be disturbed by a Sikh at such an hour. And I said to him:\n\n\"'Sahib,' said I, 'am I a badmash? A scoundrel?'\n\n\"'No,' said he, 'not unless you changed your morals when you left the service.'\n\n\"Said I, 'I am still in the service.'\n\n\"'Good,' said he. 'What then?'\n\n\"'I go listening again in no-man's land,' said I, and he whistled softly. 'Is there not a roof below your window?' I asked him, and he nodded.\n\n\"'Then let me use it, sahib, and return the same way presently.'\n\n\"So he threw back the shutter, asking no more questions, and I climbed out. The window of the room where Yussuf Dakmar and the five were stood open, but the lattice shutter was closed tight, so that I could stand up on the flat roof of the kitchen and listen without being seen. And, sahib, I could recognize the snarl of Yussuf Dakmar's voice even before my ear was laid to the open lattice. He was like a dog at bay. The other five were angry with him. They were accusing him of playing false. They swore that a great sum could be had for that letter, which they should share between them. Said a voice I did not recognize: 'If the French will pay one price they will pay another; what does money matter to them, if they can make out a case against Feisul? Will they not have Syria? The thing is simple as twice two,' said he. 'The huntsman urges on the hounds, but unless he is cleverer than they, who eats the meat? The French regard us as animals, I tell you! Very well; let us live up to the part and hunt like animals, since he who has the name should have the game as well; and when we have done the work and they want booty let them be made aware that animals must eat! We will set our own price on that document.'\n\n\"'And as for this Yussuf Dakmar,' said another man, 'let him take a back seat unless he is willing to share and share alike with us. He is not difficult to kill!'\n\n\"And at that, sahib, Yussuf Dakmar flew into a great rage and called them fools of complicated kinds.\n\n\"'Like hounds without a huntsman, ye will overrun the scent!' said he; and he spoke more like a man than any of them, although not as a man to be liked or trusted. 'Who are ye to clap your fat noses on the scent I found and tell me the how and whither of it? It may be that I can get that letter tonight. Surely I can get it between this place and Damascus; and no one can do that, for I, and I only, know where it is. Nor will I tell!' And they answered all together, 'We will make you tell!'\n\n\"But he said, 'All that ye five fools can do is to interfere. Easy to kill me, is it? Well, perhaps. It has been tried. But, if so, then though ye are jackals, kites and vultures all in one with the skill of chemists added, ye can never extract secret knowledge from a dead man's brain. Then that letter will reach Feisul tomorrow night; and the French, who speak of you now as of animals, will call you what? Princes? Noblemen?'\n\n\"I suppose they saw the point of that, sahib, for they changed their tone without, however, becoming friendly to Yussuf Dakmar. Thieves of that sort know one another, and trust none, and it is all a lie, sahib, about there being any honor among them. Fear is the only tie that binds thieves, and they proceeded to make Yussuf Dakmar afraid.\n\n\"There seems to be one among them, sahib, who is leader. He has a thin voice like a eunuch's, and unlike the others swears seldom.\n\n\"This father of a thin voice accepted the situation. He said: \"'Well and good. Let Yussuf Dakmar do the hunting for us. It is sufficient that we hunt Yussuf Dakmar. Two of us occupy the room next to Ramsden's. If Yussuf Dakmar needs aid in the night, let him summon us by scratching with his nails on the closet door. The rest will be simple. There are four in this besides us five; so if we count Yussuf Dakmar that makes ten who share the reward. Shall Yussuf Dakmar grow fat, while nine of us starve? I think not! Let him get the letter, and give it to me. We will hide it, and I will deal with the French. If he fails tonight, let him try again tomorrow on the train. But we five will also take that train to Damascus, and unless that letter is in my hands before the journey's end, then Yussuf Dakmar dies. Is that agreed?'\n\n\"All except Yussuf Dakmar agreed to it. He was very angry and called them leeches, whereat they laughed, saying that leeches only suck enough and then fall off, whereas they would take all or kill. They made him understand it, taking a great oath together to slay him without mercy unless he should get the letter and give it to them before the train reaches Damascus tomorrow evening.\n\n\"Well, sahib, he agreed presently, not with any effort at good grace, but cursing while he yielded.\n\n\"In truth, sahib, it is less fear than lack of sleep that Yussuf Dakmar feels. I could hear him yawn through the window lattice. Now a man in that condition is likely to act early in the night for fear that sleep may otherwise get the better of him, and the sahib will do well to be keenly alert from the first. I shall be asleep on that couch outside the door and will come if called, so the sahib would better not lock the door but should call loud in case of need, because I also have been long awake and may sleep heavily.\"\n\n\"Suppose I walk the streets all night?\" said I. \"Wouldn't that foil them?\"\n\n\"Nay, sahib, but the reverse; for if Yussuf Dakmar should miss you after midnight he would go in search of you, with those five in turn tracking him. And as for finding you, that would be a simple matter, for every night thief and beggar waiting for the dawn would give attention to such a big man as you and would report your movements. All six would come on you in the dark and would kill you surely. Then, as if that were not bad enough, having searched you they would learn that the letter in your possession is not the right one; and the trail of the right one would be that much easier to detect.\"\n\n\"Then come with me,\" said I, \"and we'll make a night of it together. You and I can defend ourselves against those six.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, sahib. But my place is within hail of Jimgrim. No, it is best that you see this matter through tonight between four walls. Only remember, sahib, that though a man on duty may feign sleep, it is wiser not to, because sleep steals on us unawares!\"",
    "There was no competition for seats on the Damascus train that morning. Several of the window-panes were smashed, there were bullet-marks and splinters on the woodwork everywhere--no need to ask questions. But I found time on the platform to chat with some British officers while keeping an eye lifting for Yussuf Dakmar and his friends.\n\n\"Damascus, eh? You'll have a fine journey if you get through alive. Nine passengers were shot dead in the last train down.\"\n\n\"No law up there, you know. Feisul's army's all concentrated for a crack at the French (good luck to 'em! No, I'm not wishing the French any particular luck this trip). Nobody to watch the Bedouins, so they take pot shots at every train that passes, just for the fun of it.\"\n\n\"May be war, you know, at any minute. The French are sure to make a drive for the railway line--you'll be hung up indefinitely--commandeered for an ambulance train--shot for the sake of argument--anything at all, in fact. They say those Algerian troops are getting out of hand--paid in depreciated francs and up against the high cost of debauchery. You're taking a chance.\"\n\n\"Wish I could go. Haven't seen a healthy scrap sinze Zeitun Ridge. Hey! Hullo! What's this? Lovely woman! Well, I'll be!\"\n\nIt was Mabel Ticknor, followed by the six men I was watching for, Yussuf Dakmar looking sulky and discouraged in their midst, almost like a prisoner, and the other five wearing palpably innocent expressions.\n\n\"Lord!\" remarked the officer nearest me. \"That gang's got the wind up! Look at the color of their gills! Booked through, I'll bet you, and been listening to tales all night!\"\n\nThe gang drew abreast just as another officer gave tongue to his opinion. They couldn't help hearing what he said; he had one of those voices that can carry on conversation in a boiler foundry.\n\n\"There's more in this than meets the eye! She's not a nurse. She don't walk like a missionary. I heard her buy a ticket for Aleppo. Can you imagine a lone, good-looking woman going to Aleppo by that train unless she had a laissez passe from the French? She's wearing French heels. I'll bet she's carrying secret information. Look! D'you see those two Arabs in the train?\" He pointed out Grim and Jeremy, who were leaning from a window. \"They tipped her off to get into the compartment next ahead of them. D'you see? There she goes. She was for getting into the coach ahead. They called her back.\"\n\nAlmost all the other cars were empty except that one, but, whether because humans are like sheep and herd together instinctively when afraid, or because the train crew ordered it, all six compartments of the middle first-class car were now occupied, with Mabel Ticknor alone in the front one. Nevertheless, Yussuf Dakmar and four of his companions started to climb in by the rear door. The sixth man lingered within earshot of the officers, presumably to pick up further suggestions.\n\nSo I got in at the front end and met them halfway down the corridor.\n\n\"Plenty of room in the car behind,\" I said abruptly.\n\nThey were five to one, but Yussuf Dakmar was in front, and he merely got in the way of the wolves behind him. The sixth man, who had lingered near the officers, now entered by the front end as I had done and called out that there was plenty of room in the front compartment.\n\n\"There's only a woman in here,\" he said in Arabic.\n\nAnd he set the example by taking the seat opposite to Mabel.\n\nIt would have been easy enough to get him out again, of course. Not even the polyglot train crew would have allowed Arabs to trespass without her invitation.\n\nThe trouble was that Jeremy, Grim, Narayan Singh and I all rushed to her rescue at the same minute, which let the cat out of the bag. It was Doctor Ticknor's statement in Jerusalem about not wanting to see any of us alive again if we failed to bring his wife back safe that turned the trick and caused even Grim to lose his head for a moment. When a Sikh, two obvious Arabs and an American all rush to a woman's assistance before she calls for help, there is evidence of collusion somewhere which you could hardly expect a trained spy to overlook or fail to draw conclusions from.\n\nIt was all over in a minute. The rascal left the compartment, muttering to himself in Arabic sotto voce. I caught one word; but he looked so diabolically pleased with himself that it didn't really need that to stir me into action. I take twelves in boots, with a rather broad toe, and he stopped the full heft of the hardest kick I could let loose. It put him out of action for half a day, and remains one of my pleasantest memories.\n\nHis companions had to gather him up and help him pulley-hauley fashion into the car ahead, while an officious ticket-taker demanded my name and address. I found in my wallet the card of a U.S. senator and gave him that, whereat he apologized profoundly and addressed me as \"Colonel\"--a title with which he continued to flatter me all the rest of the journey except once, when he changed it to \"Admiral\" by mistake.\n\nGrim went back into our compartment and laughed; and none of the essays I have read on laughter--not even the famous dissertation by Josh Billings--throw light on how to describe the tantalizing manner of it. He laughs several different ways: heartily at times, as men of my temperament mostly do; boisterously on occasion, after Jeremy's fashion; now and then cryptically, using laughter as a mask; then he owns a smile that suggests nothing more nor less than kindness based on understanding of human nature.\n\nBut that other is a devil of a laugh, mostly made of chuckles that seem to bubble off a Hell-brew of disillusionment, and you get the impression that he is laughing at himself--cynically laying bare the vanity and fallibility of his own mental processes--and forecasting self-discipline.\n\nThere is no mirth in it, although there is amusement; no anger, although immeasurable scorn. I should say it's a good safe laugh to indulge in, for I think it is based on ability to see himself and his own mistakes more clearly than anybody else can, and there is no note of defeat in it. But it is full of a cruel irony that brings to mind a vision of one of those old medieval flagellant priests reviewing his sins before thrashing his own body with a wire whip.\n\n\"So that ends that,\" he said at last, with the gesture of a man who sweeps the pieces from a board, to set them up anew and start again. \"Luckily we're not the only fools in Asia. Those six rascals know now that Mabel and we are one party.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" sneered Jeremy. \"What can the devils do?\"\n\n\"Not much this side of the border at Deraa,\" Grim answered. \"After Deraa pretty well what they're minded. They could have us pinched on some trumped-up charge, in which case we'd be searched, Mabel included. No. We've played too long on the defensive. Deraa is the danger-point. The telegraph line is cut there, and all messages going north or south have to be carried by hand across the border. The French have an agent there who censors everything. He's the boy we've got to fool. If they appeal to him this train will go on without us.",
    "While the fireman scraped the iron floor for his last two shovelfuls of coal-dust and the train wheezed wearily into the dark station, Grim began to busy himself in mysterious ways. Part of his own costume consisted of a short, curved scimitar attached to an embroidered belt--the sort of thing that Arabs wear for ornament rather than use. He took it off and, groping in the dark, helped Mabel put it on, without a word of explanation.\n\nThen, instead of putting on his own Moslem over-cloak he threw that over her shoulders and, digging down into his bag for a spare head-dress, snatched her hat off and bound on the white kerchief in its place with the usual double, gold-covered cord of camel-hair.\n\nThen came my friend the train conductor and addressed me as Colonel, offering to carry out the bags. The moment he had grabbed his load and gone Grim broke silence:\n\n\"Call her Colonel and me Grim. Don't forget how!\"\n\nWe became aware of faces under helmets peering through the window--officers of Feisul's army on the watch for unwelcome visitors. From behind them came the conductor's voice again, airing his English:\n\n\"Any more bags inside there, Colonel?\"\n\n\"Get out quick, Jeremy, and make a fuss about the Colonel coming!\" ordered Grim.\n\nJeremy suddenly became the arch-efficient servitor, establishing importance for his chief, and never a newly made millionaire or modern demagog had such skillful advertisement. The Shereefian officers stood back at a respectful distance, ready to salute when the personage should deign to alight.\n\n\"What shall be done with the memsahib's hat?\" demanded Narayan Singh.\n\nYou could only see the whites of his eyes, but he shook something in his right hand.\n\n\"Eat it!\" Grim answered.\n\n\"Heavens! That's my best hat!\" objected Mabel. \"Give it here. I'll carry it under the cloak.\"\n\n\"Get rid of it!\" Grim ordered; and Narayan Singh strode off to contribute yellow Leghorn straw and poppies to the engine furnace.\n\nI gave him ten piastres to fee the engineer, and five for the fireman, so you might say that was high-priced fuel.\n\n\"What kind of bunk are you throwing this time?\" I asked Grim.\n\nHe didn't answer, but gave orders to Mabel in short, crisp syllables.\n\n\"You're Colonel Lawrence. Answer no questions. If anyone salutes, just move your hand and bow your head a bit. You're just his height. Look straight in front of you and take long strides. Bend your head forward a little; there, that's it.\"\n\n\"I'm scared!\" announced Mabel, by way of asking for more particulars.\n\nShe wasn't scared in the least.\n\n\"Piffle!\" Grim answered. \"Remember you're Lawrence, that's all. They'd give you Damascus if you asked for it. Follow Jeremy, and leave the rest to us.\"\n\nI don't doubt that Grim had been turning over the whole plan in his mind for hours past, but when I taxed him with it afterward his reply was characteristic:\n\n\"If we'd rehearsed it, Mabel and Hadad would both have been self-conscious. The game is to study your man--or woman, as the case may be--and sometimes drill 'em, sometimes spring it on 'em, according to circumstances. The only rule is to study people; there are no two quite alike.\"\n\nHadad was surprised into silence, too thoughtful a man to do anything except hold his tongue until the next move should throw more light on the situation. He followed us out of the car, saying nothing; and being recognized by the light of one dim lantern as an intimate friend of Feisul, he accomplished all that Grim could have asked of him.\n\nHe was known to have been in Europe until recently. Rumours about Lawrence had been tossed from mouth to mouth for days past, and here was somebody who looked like Lawrence in the dark, followed by Grim and Hadad and addressed as \"Colonel.\" Why shouldn't those three Shereefian officers jump to conclusions, salute like automatons and grin like loyal men who have surprised a secret and won't tell anyone but their bosom friends? It was all over Damascus within the hour that Lawrence had come from England to stand by Feisul in the last ditch. The secret was kept perfectly!\n\nWe let Mabel walk ahead of us, and there was no trouble at the customs barrier, where normally every piastre that could be wrung from protesting passengers were mulcted to support a starving treasury; for the officers strode behind us, and trade signs to the customs clerk, who immediately swore at everyone in sight and sent all his minions to yell for the best cabs in Damascus.\n\nNarayan Singh distributed largesse to about a hundred touts and hangers-on and we splashed off toward the hotel in two open landaus, through streets six inches deep in water except at the cross-gutters, where the horses jumped for fear of losing soundings. Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, were in flood as usual at that time of year, and the scavenging street curs had to swim from one garbage heap to the next. There was a gorgeous battle going on opposite the hotel door, where half a dozen white-ivoried mongrels with their backs to a heap of kitchen leavings held a ford against a dozen others, each beast that made good his passage joining with the defenders to fight off the rest. I stood on the hotel steps and watched the war for several minutes, while Grim went in with the others and registered as \"Rupert Ramsden of Chicago, U.S.A., and party.\"\n\nThe flood, and darkness owing to the lack of fuel, were all in our favour, for such folk as were abroad were hardly of the sort whose gossip would carry weight; nevertheless, we hadn't been in the hotel twenty minutes before an agent of the bank put in his appearance, speaking French volubly. Seeing my name on the register, he made the mistake of confining his attention to me, which enabled Grim to get Mabel safely away into a big room on the second floor.",
    "\"Any gas masks among the supplies you ordered?\" Grim asked him; and Feisul nodded.\n\"That banker has played fast and loose with us until the last minute. Relying on our undertaking not to molest foreigners he has resided in Damascus, making promises one day and breaking them the next, keeping his funds in Beirut and his agency here, draining money out of the country all the while.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you arrest him?\"\n\n\"We gave our word to the French that he should have complete protection and immunity. It seemed a good thing to us to have such an influential banker here; he has international connections. As recently as yesterday, twenty minutes before that ultimatum came, he was in this room assuring me that he would be able to solve the credit difficulty within a day or two.\"\n\n\"Would you like to send for him now?\" suggested Grim.\n\n\"I doubt if he would come.\"\n\n\"Well, have him fetched!\"\n\nFeisul shook his head.\n\n\"If other people break their promises, that is no reason why we should break ours. If we can defeat the French and force them to make other terms, then we will expel him from Syria. I leave at midnight, Jimgrim.\"\n\n\"To defeat the French? You go to your Waterloo! You're in check with only one move possible, and I'm here to make you realize it. You're a man after my own heart, Feisul, but you and your Arabs are children at dealing with these foreign exploiters! They can beat you at every game but honesty. And listen: If you did defeat the French--if you drove them into the sea tomorrow, they'd get away with all the money in Beirut and you'd still be at the mercy of foreign capitalists! Instead of an independent Arab kingdom here you'd have a mixture of peoples and religions all plotting against one another and you, with capitulations and foreign consuls getting in the way, and bond-holding bankers sitting on top of it all like the Old Man of the Sea in the story of Sindbad the Sailor! Leave that to the French! Let them have all Syria to stew in! Go to England where your friends are. Let the politicians alone. Meet real folk and talk with them. Tell them the truth; for they don't know it! Talk with the men and women who haven't got political jobs to lose--with the fellows who did the fighting--with the men and women who have votes. They'll believe you. They've given up believing politicians, and they're learning how to twist the politicians' tails. You'll find yourself in Baghdad within a year or two, with all Mesopotamia to make a garden of and none but Arabs to deal with. That's your field!\"\n\nFeisul smiled with the air of a man who recognizes but is unconvinced.\n\n\"There are always things that might have been,\" he answered. \"As it is, I cannot desert the army.\"\n\n\"We'll save what we can of the army,\" Grim answered. \"Your Syrians will save their own skins; it's only the Arabs we've got to look out for--a line of retreat for the Arab regiments, and another for you. It's not too late, and you know I'm right! Come on; let's get busy and do it!\"\n\nFeisul's smile was all affection and approval, but he shook his head.\n\n\"If what you say is true, I should only have the same problem in Mesopotamia--foreign financiers,\" he answered.\n\n\"That's exactly where you're wrong!\" Grim retorted triumphantly.\nHe stood up, and pointed at Jeremy.\n\n\"Here's a man who owns a gold-mine. It lies between Mesopotamia and your father's kingdom of the Hedjaz, and its exact whereabouts is a secret. He's here tonight to make you a present of the mine! And here's another man,\"--he pointed at me--\"a mining expert, who'll tell you what the thing's worth. It's yours, if you'll agree to abandon Syria and lay a course for Baghdad!\"\n\nFeisul was interested; he couldn't help being. And he was utterly convinced of Grim's sincerity. But he wasn't moved from his purpose, and not even Jeremy's account of the gold-mine, or my professional opinion of its value, had the least effect toward cancelling the plans he had in mind. He was deeply affected by the offer, but that was all.\n\n\"Good heavens, man!\" Grim exploded suddenly. \"Surely you won't throw the whole world into war again! You know what it will mean if the French kill or imprison you. There isn't a Moslem of all the millions in Asia who won't swear vengeance against the West--you know that! A direct descendant of Mohammed, and the first outstanding, conquering Moslem since Saladin--\"\n\n\"The Allies should have thought of that before they broke promises,\" said Feisul.\n\n\"Never mind them. Damn them!\" answered Grim. \"It's up to you! The future of civilization is in your lap this minute! Can't you see that if you lose you'll be a martyr, and Islam will rise to avenge you?\"\n\n\"Inshallah,\" said Feisul, nodding.\n\n\"But that if you let pride go by the board, and seem to run away, there'll be a breathing spell? Asia would wonder for a few months, and do nothing, until it began to dawn on them that you had acted wisely and had a better plan in view.\"\n\n\"I am not proud, except of my nation,\" Feisul answered. \"I would not let pride interfere with policy. But it is too late to talk of this.\"\n\n\"Which is better?\" Grin demanded. \"A martyr, the very mention of whose name means war, or a living power for peace under a temporary cloud?\"\n\n\"I am afraid I am a poor host. Forgive me,\" Feisul answered. \"Dinner has been waiting all this while, and you have a lady with you. This is disgraceful.\"",
    "Grim asked at once for the auto for me (I couldn't have had it otherwise), and a moment later Jeremy and I were scooting into darkness through narrow streets and driving rain, with the hubs of the wheels awash in places and \"shipping it green\" over the floor when we dipped and pitched over a cross-street gutter. The Arab driver knew the way, from which I take it he had a compass in his head as well as a charm against accidents and a spirit of recklessness that put faith in worn-out springs. There wasn't room for more than one set of wheels at a time in most of the streets we tore through, but a camel tried to share one fairway with us and had the worst of it; he cannoned off into an alley 'himd end first, and we could hear him bellowing with rage a block away.\n\nAnd our manner of stopping was like our progress, prompt. The brake-bands went on with a shriek and Jeremy and I pitched forward as the car brought up against the kerb in front of an enormous door, whose brass knocker shone like gold in the rays of our headlights. We told the Arab to wait for us and stepped knee-deep into a pool invisible, stumbled and nearly fell over a great stone set to bridge the flood between street and door, then proceeded to use the knocker importunately, thunderously, angrily, as men with wet feet and bruised toes likely will, whatever the custom of the country.\n\nWe went on knocking, taking turns, until the door opened at last and the banker's servant peered at us with a candle in his hand, demanding to know in the name of the thousand and one devils whom Solomon boiled in oil what impudent scavengers were making all that noise. But the banker himself was in the background, thinking perhaps that the French had come already, on the lookout over the servant's shoulder for a glimpse of a kepi. So we put our shoulders to the door, thrust by the servant, and walked in.\n\n\"Take care! I have a pistol in my hand!\" said the banker's voice.\n\n\"Three shots for a shilling at me then!\" retorted Jeremy.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Tell that shivering fool to bring the candle, and you'll see!\"\n\n\"Oh, you, is it! I told you to come in the morning. I can't see you now.\"\n\n\"Can't see me, eh? Come in here and peel your eyes, cocky! Sit down and look at us. There, take a pew. Wonder where I learned such good English? Well, I used to shine the toenails of the Prince o' Wales, and you have to pass a Civil Service examination before they give you that good job. I talk any language except French and Jewish, but this master of mine turns out to be a Jew who talks French, and not a prizefighter after all.\nWhat did I tell you this evening? Said he was a spy for the French, didn't I? I tell you, I'm a dependable man. What I say you can bet on till you've lost all your money. Here he is, spying to beat the promised-landers--just had tea with Feisul and learned all the inside facts--offered me a pound to come and find you, but I charged him two and got the money in advance.\nYou ought to pay me a commission, too, and then I'll get married if there's an honest woman left in Damascus. If either of you want my advice, you won't believe a word the other says, but I expect you're both too wilful to be guided. Anyhow, you'll have to talk in front of me, because my master is afraid of being murdered; he isn't afraid of ghosts or bad smells, but the sight of a long knife turns his heart to water and sets him to praying so loud that you can't get a word in edgewise. Go on, both of you--yalla! Talk!\"\n\nDoes it begin to be obvious why kings used to employ court jesters? The modern cabinets should have them--men like Jeremy (though they'd be hard to find) to break the crust of situations. Suspicion weakens in the presence of incongruity.\n\n\"This fellow seems less than half-witted,\" I said, \"but he's shrewd, and I've found him useful. Unfortunately he has picked up a lot of information, so we'll have to keep an eye on him. My business is to communicate with the French General Staff and I'm told you know how to manage it.\"\n\n\"Huh-huh? Who told you that?\"\n\n\"Those who gave me my instructions. If you don't know who they are without my telling you, you're the wrong man and I'll not waste time with you.\"\n\n\"Let us suppose that I know then. Proceed.\"\n\n\"Your name was given to me as that of a man who can be trusted to take necessary action in the interests of ... er ... you understand?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh!\"\n\n\"The plot for Feisul to be kidnapped by some Syrian members of his staff has been discovered at the last minute,\" I said, looking hard at him; and he winced palpably.",
    "The flukey morning breeze shifted several points. The mist curled suddenly and began to flow diagonally across our line of cars instead of toward us, and from one moment to the next you could see straight along the road for maybe a mile or more. There was a sight worth seeing--Feisul's cavalry in full rout--running away from ghosts by the look of it--their formation hardly yet broken, horse and man racing with the wind and a scattering of unhorsed fugitives streaming behind like a comet's tail.\n\nAccording to Grim, who should know, that cavalry division was the kingpin of Feisul's plan. He had intended to lead a raid in person, swooping down the French flank to their rear; but the three staff traitors, Daulch, Hattin and Aubck, sent forward the previous evening to place the division and hold it ready, had simply tipped the French off to the whole plan and at the critical moment of Feisul's arrival on the scene had ordered the sauve-qui-peut. I don't believe the French used more than a can or two of gas. I don't believe they had more than a few cans of it so far advanced.\n\nBut the sauve-qui-peut might have been useless without Feisul's capture, for he was just the man to rally a routed army and snatch victory out of a defeat. Nobody knew better than Feisul the weakness of the French communications, and the work of those three traitors was only half done when the cavalry took to its heels. The one man who could possibly save the day had to be bagged and handed over.\n\nI didn't realize all that, of course, in the twinkling of an eye, as they say you do in a climax. Maybe I've never faced a climax. I'm no psychologist and not at all given to review of sudden situations in the abstract.\n\nThere was a fight, or a riot, or something like it going on near the head of our line of autos. The first two or three had come to a standstill; several in the middle of the line were trying to wheel outward and bolt for it behind the fleeing cavalry, and those at the tail end were blocked by one that had broken down. Of course everybody was yelling at the top of his lungs and the hurrying shreds of blown mist further confounded the confusion.\n\nSo Jeremy and I ran forward, plunging through the mud and knocking over whoever blocked our way. It was rather fun--like the football field at school. But one man--a Syrian officer--stood near the last of the forward cars with the evident purpose of standing off interference. He took careful aim at me with a revolver, fired point-blank, and missed.\n\nI forgot all about my own pistol and went for him with a laugh and a yell of sheer exhilaration. There's an eighth of a ton of me, mostly bone and muscle, so it isn't a sinecure to have to stop my fist when the rest of the bulk is under way behind it. I landed so hard on his nose, and with such tremendous impetus, that he hadn't enough initial stability to take the impact and bring me up on my feet. He went down like a ninepin, I on top of him, laughing with mud in my teeth, and Jeremy landed on top of the two of us, holding the skirts of his cloak in both hands as he jumped.\n\nJeremy picked up the fellow's revolver and threw it out of sight, and the two of us ran on again--too late by now to help in the emergency, but in time for the next event.\n\nGrim had managed everything, although he was bleeding, and smiling serenely through the blood. Hadad was there, not smiling at all, but bleached white with excitement; he had brought a number of Arab officers with him, six or seven of whom were standing on the running-board of the front car and all arguing with Feisul, who sat back with his feet and hands tied, guarded by Narayan Singh.\n\nAt Grim's feet--dead, with bullets through their heads--were three Syrian staff officers. They were the traitors Daulch, Hattin and Aubek. Grim's pistol was in his right hand and had been used.\n\nThere had been a first-class fight, all over in two minutes; for the traitors hadn't arrived on the scene without assistants. Unfortunately for them, Hadad had turned up at the same moment with his loyalists. Narayan Singh had jumped from the car behind and seized Feisul, thrown him to the floor out of the path of bullets, and tied his arms. It was actually Mabel, hardly realizing what she was doing but obeying the Sikh's orders yelled in her ear as he struggled to keep his wiry prisoner down, who tied the king's feet, using her Arab girdle."

  "Edgar Wallace -- The Book of All-Power": [
    "If a man is not eager for adventure at the age of twenty-two, the enticement of romantic possibilities will never come to him. The chairman of the Ukraine Oil Company looked with a little amusement at the young man who sat on the edge of a chair by the chairman's desk, and noted how the eye of the youth had kindled at every fresh discouragement which the chairman had put forward. Enthusiasm, reflected the elder man, was one of the qualities which were most desirable in the man who was to accept the position which Malcolm Hay was at that moment considering.\n\n\"Russia is a strange country,\" said Mr. Tremayne. \"It is one of the mystery places of the world. You hear fellows coming back from China who tell you amazing stories of the idiosyncrasies of the Chink. But I can tell you, from my own personal observations, that the Chinaman is an open book in words of one syllable compared with the average Russian peasant. By the way, you speak Russian, I understand?\"\n\nHay nodded.\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" he said, \"I have been talking Russian ever since I was sixteen, and I speak both the dialects.\"\n\n\"Good!\" nodded Mr. Tremayne. \"Now, all that remains for you to do is to think both dialects. I was in Southern Russia attending to our wells for twenty years. In fact, long before our wells came into being, and I can honestly say that, though I am not by any means an unintelligent man, I know just as little about the Russian to-day as I did when I went there. He's the most elusive creature. You think you know him two days after you have met him. Two days later you find that you have changed all your opinions about him; and by the end of the first year, if you have kept a careful note of your observations and impressions in a diary, you will discover that you have three hundred and sixty-five different views--unless it happens to be a leap year.\"\n\n\"What happens in a leap year?\" asked the innocent Hay.\n\n\"You have three hundred and sixty-six views,\" said the solemn Mr. Tremayne.\n\nHe struck a bell.\n\n\"We shan't want you to leave London for a week or two,\" he said, \"and in the meantime you had better study up our own special literature. We can give you particulars about the country--that part of the country in which the wells are situated--which you will not find in the guidebooks. There are also a few notable personages whom it will be advisable for you to study.\"\n\n\"I know most of them,\" said the youth with easy confidence. \"As a matter of fact, I got the British Consul to send me a local directory and swotted it.\"\n\nMr. Tremayne concealed a smile.\n\n\"And what did the local directory say about Israel Kensky?\" he asked innocently.\n\n\"Israel Kensky?\" said the puzzled youth. \"I don't remember that name.\"\n\n\"It is the only name worth remembering,\" said the other dryly, \"and, by the way, you'll be able to study him in a strange environment, for he is in London at this moment.\"\n\nA clerk had answered the bell and stood waiting in the doorway.\n\n\"Get Mr. Hay those books and pamphlets I spoke to you about,\" said Tremayne. \"And, by the way, when did M. Kensky arrive?\"\n\n\"To-day,\" said the clerk.\n\nTremayne nodded.\n\n\"In fact,\" he said, \"London this week will be filled with people whose names are not in your precious directory, and all of whom you should know. The Yaroslavs are paying a sort of state visit.\"\n\n\"The Yaroslavs?\" repeated Hay. \"Oh, of course----\"\n\n\"The Grand Duke and his daughter,\" added Mr. Tremayne.\n\n\"Well,\" smiled the young man, \"I'm not likely to meet the Grand Duke or the Grand Duchess. I understand the royal family of Russia is a little exclusive.\"\n\n\"Everything is likely in Russia,\" said the optimistic Mr. Tremayne. \"If you come back in a few years' time and tell me that you've been appointed an admiral in the Russian Navy, or that you've married the Grand Duchess Irene Yaroslav, I shall not for one moment disbelieve you. At the same time, if you come back from Russia without your ears, the same having been cut off by your peasant neighbours to propitiate the ghost of a martyr who died six hundred years ago, I shall not be surprised either. That is the country you're going to--and I envy you.\"\n\n\"I'm a little surprised at myself,\" admitted Malcolm, \"it seems almost incredible. Of course, sir, I have a lot to learn and I'm not placing too much reliance upon my degree.\"\n\n\"Your science degree?\" said Tremayne. \"It may be useful, but a divinity degree would have been better.\"\n\n\"A divinity degree?\"\n\nTremayne nodded.\n\n\"It is religion you want in Russia, and especially local religion. You'll have to do a mighty lot of adapting when you're out there, Hay, and I don't think you could do better than get acquainted with the local saints. You'll find that the birth or death of four or five of them are celebrated every week, and that your workmen will take a day's holiday for each commemoration. If you're not pretty smart, they'll whip in a few saints who have no existence, and you'll get no work done at all--that will do.\"\n\n\nHe ended the interview with a jerk of his head, and as the young man got to his feet to go, added: \"Come back again to-morrow. I think you ought to see Kensky.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\" asked Hay courteously. \"A local magnate?\"\n\n\"In a sense he is and in a sense he's not,\" said the careful Mr. Tremayne. \"He's a big man locally, and from a business point of view, I suppose he is a magnate. However, you'll be able to judge for yourself.\"\n\nMalcolm Hay went out into the teeming streets of London, walking on air. It was his first appointment--he was earning money, and it seemed rather like a high-class dream.",
    "It was a big underground room, the sort of basement dining-room one finds in certain of the caf\u00e9s in Soho, and its decorations and furniture were solid and comfortable. There were a dozen men in this innocent-looking saloon when the girl entered. They were standing about talking, or sitting at the tables playing games. The air was blue with tobacco smoke.\n\nHer arrival seemed to be the signal for the beginning of a conference. Four small tables were drawn from the sides and placed together, and in a few seconds she found herself one of a dozen that sat about the board.\n\nThe man who seemed to take charge of the proceedings she did not know. He was a Russian--a big, clean-shaven man, quietly and even well-dressed. His hair was flaming red, his nose was crooked. It was this crooked nose which gave her a clue to his identity. She remembered in Kieff, where physical peculiarities could not pass unnoticed, some reference to \"twist nose,\" and racked her brains in an effort to recall who that personage was. That he knew her he very quickly showed.\n\n\"Sophia Kensky,\" he said, \"we have sent for you to ask you why your father is in London.\"\n\n\"If you know my father,\" she replied, \"you know also that I, his daughter, do not share his secrets.\"\n\nThe man at the head of the table nodded.\n\n\"I know him,\" he said grimly, \"also I know you, Sophia. I have seen you often at the meetings of our society in Kieff.\"\n\nAgain she frowned, trying to recall his name and where she had seen him. It was not at any of the meetings of the secret society--of that she was sure. He seemed to read her thoughts, for he laughed--a deep, thunderous laugh which filled the underground room with sound.\n\n\"It is strange that you do not know me,\" he said, \"and yet I have seen you a hundred times, and you have seen me.\"\n\nA light dawned on her.\n\n\"Boolba, the _buffet-schek_ of the Grand Duke!\" she gasped.\n\nHe nodded, absurdly pleased at the recognition.\n\n\"I do not attend the meetings in Kieff, little sister, for reasons which you will understand. But here in London, where I have come in advance of Yaroslav, it is possible. Now, Sophia Kensky, you are a proved friend of our movement?\"\n\nShe nodded, since the statement was in the way of a question.\n\n\"It is known to you, as to us, that your father, Israel Kensky, is a friend of the Grand Duchess.\"\n\nBoolba, the President, saw the sullen look on her face and drew his own conclusions, even before she explained her antipathy to the young girl who held that exalted position.\n\n\"It is a mystery to me, Boolba,\" she said, \"for what interest can this great lady have in an old Jew?\"\n\n\"The old Jew is rich,\" said Boolba significantly.\n\n\"So also is Irene Yaroslav,\" said the girl. \"It is not for money that she comes.\"\n\n\"It is not for money,\" agreed the other, \"it is for something else. When the Grand Duchess Irene was a child, she was in the streets of Kieff one day in charge of her nurse. It happened that some Caucasian soldiers stationed in the town started a pogrom against the Jews. The soldiers were very drunk; they were darting to and fro in the street on their little horses, and the nurse became frightened and left the child. Your father was in hiding, and the soldiers were searching for him; yet, when he saw the danger of the Grand Duchess, he ran from his hiding-place, snatched her up under the hoofs of the horses, and bore her away into his house.\"\n\n\"I did not know this,\" said Sophia, listening open-mouthed. Her father had never spoken of the incident, and the curious affection which this high-born lady had for the old usurer of Kieff had ever been a source of wonder to her.\n\n\"You know it now,\" said Boolba. \"The Grand Duke has long since forgotten what he owes to Israel Kensky, but the Grand Duchess has not. Therefore, she comes to him with all her troubles--and that, Sophia Kensky, is why we have sent for you.\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"I see,\" she said at last, \"you wish me to spy upon Israel Kensky and tell you all that happens.\"\n\n\"I want to know all that passes between him and the Grand Duchess,\" said Boolba. \"She comes to London to-morrow with her father, and it is certain she will seek out Israel Kensky. Every letter that passes between them must be opened.\"\n\n\"But----\" she began.\n\n\"There is no 'but,'\" roared Boolba. \"Hear and obey; it is ordered!\"\n\nHe turned abruptly to the man on his left.\n\n\"You understand, Yaroslav arrives in London to-morrow. It is desirable that he should not go away.\"\n\n\"But, but, Excellency,\" stammered the man on his left, \"here in London!\"\n\nBoolba nodded.\n\n\"But, Excellency,\" wailed the man, \"in London we are safe; it is the one refuge to which our friends can come. If such a thing should happen, what would be our fate? We could not meet together. We should be hounded down by the police from morning until night; we should be deported--it would be the ruin of the great movement.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, it is an order,\" said Boolba doggedly; \"this is a matter beyond the cause. It will gain us powerful protectors at the court, and I promise you that, though the commotion will be great, yet it will not last for very long, and you will be left undisturbed.\"\n\n\"But----\" began one of the audience, and Boolba silenced him with a gesture.\n\n\"I promise that none of you shall come to harm, my little pigeons, and that you shall not be concerned in this matter.\"\n\n\"But who will do it, Excellency?\" asked another member.\n\n\"That is too important to be decided without a meeting of all the brethren. For my part, I would not carry out such an order unless I received the instructions of our President.\"\n\n\"I promise that none of you shall take a risk,\" sneered Boolba. \"Now speak, Yakoff!\"\n\nThe man who had accompanied Sophia Kensky smiled importantly at the company, then turned to Sophia.\n\n\"Must I say this before Sophia Kensky?\" he asked.\n\n\"Speak,\" said Boolba. \"We are all brothers and sisters, and none will betray you.\"\n\nYakoff cleared his throat.\n\n\"When your Excellency wrote to me from Kieff, asking me to find a man, I was in despair,\" he began--an evidently rehearsed speech, \"I tore my hair, I wept----\"\n\n\"Tell us what you have done,\" said the impatient Boolba. \"For what does it matter, in the name of the saints and the holy martyrs\" (everyone at the table, including Boolba, crossed himself) \"whether your hair was torn or your head was hammered?\"\n\n\"It was a difficult task, Excellency,\" said Yakoff in a more subdued tone, \"but Providence helped me. There is a good comrade of ours who is engaged in punishing the bourgeoisie by relieving them of their goods----\"\n\n\"A thief, yes,\" said Boolba.\n\n\"Through him I learnt that a certain man had arrived in England and was in hiding. This man is a professional assassin.\"\n\nThey looked at him incredulously, all except Boolba, who had heard the story before.\n\n\"An assassin?\" said one. \"Of what nationality?\"\n\n\"American,\" said Yakoff, and there was a little titter of laughter.",
    "He brought Dr. Von Krauss from Berlin, because von Krauss was an authority upon blood infection and spent a week of intense mental agony until he was pronounced out of danger.\n\nHe sat before a long mirror in his bedroom, that gave on Horridge's Hotel, and surveyed himself thoughtfully. He was looking at the only man he trusted, for it was not vanity, but a love of agreeable company that explained the passion for mirrors which was the jest of St. Petersburg.\n\nIt was his fourth day in London and a little table near the window was covered with patterns of cloth; he had spent an exciting afternoon with the representative of his tailor. But it was not of sartorial magnificence that he was thinking.\n\nHe stretched out his legs comfortably towards his reflection, and smiled.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, as though answering some secret thought, and he and the reflection nodded to one another as though they had reached a complete understanding.\n\nPresently he pushed the bell and his valet appeared.\n\n\"Has the Grand Duke gone?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, Excellency,\" replied the man.\n\n\"And the Grand Duchess?\"\n\n\"Yes, Excellency.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Serganoff nodded.\n\n\"Is your Excellency's headache better?\" asked the man.\n\n\"Much better,\" replied the Chief of Police. \"Go to their Highness's suite, and tell their servant--what is the man's name?\"\n\n\"Boolba, Excellency,\" said the valet.\n\n\"Yes, that is the fellow. Ask him to come to me. The Grand Duke mentioned a matter which I forgot to tell Boolba.\"\n\nBoolba made his appearance, a suave domestic, wearing the inconspicuous livery of an English butler rather than the ornate uniform which accompanied his office in Kieff.\n\n\"That will do.\" Serganoff dismissed his valet. \"Boolba, come here.\"\n\nThe man approached him and Serganoff lowered his voice.\n\n\"You have made a fool of me again, Boolba.\"\n\n\"Excellency,\" pleaded the man urgently, \"I have done all that was possible.\"\n\n\"You have placed my fortune and my life in the hands of an American criminal. If that is your idea of doing all that is possible, I agree with you,\" said Serganoff. \"Be careful, Boolba! The arm of the Bureau is a very long one, and greater men than you have disappeared from their homes.\"\n\n\"Illustrious Excellency,\" said the agitated man, \"I swear to you I did all that you requested. There were many reasons why I should not entrust this matter to the men of the secret society.\"\n\n\"I should like to hear a few,\" said Serganoff, cleaning his nails delicately.\n\n\"Excellency, the Grand Duke stands well with the society. He had never oppressed them, and he is the only popular member of the Imperial House with our--their society.\"\n\n\"Our society, eh?\" said Serganoff, noticing the slip. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Besides, Excellency,\" said Boolba, \"it was necessary not only to kill the Grand Duke, but to shoot down his assassin. Our plan was to get this American to shoot him in the park, where he walks in the morning, and then for one of the society to shoot the American. That was a good plan, because it meant that the man who could talk would talk no more, and that the comrade who shot down the murderer would stand well with the Government.\"\n\nSerganoff nodded.\n\n\"And your plan has failed,\" he said, \"failed miserably at the outset. You dog!\"\n\nHe leapt to his feet, his eyes blazing, and Boolba stepped back.\n\n\"Highness, wait, wait!\" he cried. \"I have something else in my mind! I could have helped Highness better if I had known more. But I could only guess. I had to grope in the dark all the time.\"\n\n\"Do you imagine I am going to take you into my confidence?\" asked Serganoff. \"What manner of fool am I? Tell me what you have guessed. You may sit down; nobody will come in, and if they do you can be buttoning my boots.\"\n\nBoolba wiped his damp face with a handkerchief and leaned nearer to the man.\n\n\"If the Grand Duke dies, a certain illustrious person succeeds to his estates,\" he said, \"but not to his title.\"\n\nSerganoff looked at him sharply. The man had put into words the one difficulty which had occupied the mind of the Chief of Police for months.\n\n\"Well?\" he said.\n\n\"The title is in the gift of the Czar,\" said Boolba. \"He alone can create a Grand Duke who succeeds but is not in the direct line. Therefore, the killing of Yaroslav would bring little but the property to the illustrious person. Only if His Imperial Majesty decided upon a worthier holder, or if the Grand Duke fell under a cloud at Court, could it pass to the illustrious person.\"\n\n\"That I know,\" said Serganoff. \"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, Highness, would it not be better if the Grand Duke were disgraced, if he were brought to St. Petersburg to answer certain charges which the illustrious person formulated? After, the Grand Duke might die--that is a simple matter. Russia would think that he had been put to death by the Court party as a matter of policy. Yaroslav is not in favour at the Court,\" he added significantly; but Serganoff shook his head.\n\n\"He is not sufficiently out of favour yet,\" he said. \"Go on, man, you have something in your mind.\"\n\nBoolba edged closer.\n\n\"Suppose the Grand Duke or the Grand Duchess were involved in some conspiracy against the Imperial House?\" he said, speaking rapidly. \"Suppose, on evidence which could not be disputed, such as the evidence of the London police, it was proved that either the Grand Duke or his daughter was in league with an anarchist society, or was attending their meetings--does your Excellency see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Serganoff, \"but they do not attend meetings.\"\n\nBoolba hesitated.\n\n\"Yet,\" he said, speaking slowly, \"I would guarantee that I could bring the Grand Duchess Irene to such a meeting, and that I could arrange for the place to be raided whilst she was there.\"\n\nSerganoff put down his orange stick and eyed the other keenly.\n\n\"You have brains, Boolba,\" he said. \"Some day I shall bring you to St. Petersburg and place you on my staff--if you do not know too much.\"\n\nHe paced the apartment, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\n\"Suppose you get in touch with this American again, bring him to the meeting, unless he's afraid to come, and then boldly suggest to him that he goes to St. Petersburg to make an attempt upon the life of the Czar himself.\"\n\n\"He would reject it,\" said Boolba, shaking his head.\n\n\"What if he did--that doesn't matter,\" said Serganoff impatiently. \"It is sufficient that the suggestion is made. Suppose this man is amongst these infamous fellows when the London police raid and arrest them, and he makes a statement that he was approached to destroy the Imperial life, and the Grand Duchess Irene is arrested at the same time?\"\n\nBoolba's eyes brightened.\n\n\"That is a wonderful idea, Highness,\" he said admiringly.\n\nSerganoff continued his pacing, and presently stopped.\n\n\"I will arrange the police raid,\" he said. \"I am in communication with Scotland Yard, and it will be better if I am present when the raid is conducted. It is necessary that I should identify myself with this chapter,\" he said, \"but how will you induce the Grand Duchess to come?\"\n\n\"Leave that to me, Highness,\" replied the man, and gave some details of his scheme.",
    "His vigil was painfully monotonous. It was the most uninteresting job he had ever undertaken. Most of the habitu\u00e9s of the club had evidently come at an early hour, for he saw nobody come in and nobody go out until nearly eleven o'clock. It began to rain a fine, thin drizzle, which penetrated every crevice, which insinuated itself down his neck, though his collar was upturned; and then, on top of this, came a gusty easterly wind, which chilled him to the marrow. Keeping in the shadow of the houses opposite, he maintained, however, a careful scrutiny, thereby earning the suspicion of a policeman, who passed him twice on his beat before he stopped to ask if he were looking for somebody.\n\nAs midnight chimed from a neighbouring church the door of the club opened and its members came out. Malcolm crossed the road and walked down to meet them, since they all seemed to be coming in the same direction.\n\nThere were about twenty men, and they were speaking in Russian or Yiddish, but the subjects of their discourse were of the most innocent character. He saw nobody he knew, or had ever seen before. Israel Kensky had expected that the St. Petersburg Chief of Police would be present; that expectation was not realized. Then he heard the door bolted and chained, and went home, after the most unprofitable evening he had ever spent.\n\nHow much better it would have been to sit in the warm theatre, with, perhaps, a clear view of the girl, watching her every movement, seeing her smile, noting her little tricks of manner or gesture.\n\nIn the end he laughed himself into a sane condition of mind, ate a hearty supper, and went to bed to dream that Serganoff was pursuing him with a hammer in his hand, and that the Grand Duchess was sitting in a box wildly applauding the efforts of her homicidal relative.\n\nThe next afternoon Malcolm Hay was packing, with the remainder of his belongings, a few articles he had purchased in London. Amongst these was a small and serviceable Colt revolver, and he stood balancing this in the palm of his hand, uncertain as to whether it would not be better to retain his weapon until after his present adventure. Twice he put it into his portmanteau and twice took it out again, and finally, blushing at the act, he slipped the weapon into his hip-pocket.\n\nHe felt theatrical and cheap in doing so. He told himself that he was investing a very common-place measure of precaution taken by old Israel Kensky, who was probably in the secret police, to protect his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, with an importance and a romance which it did not deserve. He went down to his post that night, feeling horribly self-conscious. This time he kept on the same side of the street as that on which the club was situated.\n\nHis watch was rewarded by events of greater interest than had occurred on the previous night. He had not been on duty half an hour before two men walked rapidly from the end of the street and passed him so closely that he could not make any mistake as to the identity of one. Had he not been able to recognize him, his voice would have instantly betrayed his identity, for, as they passed, the shorter of the two was talking.\n\n\"I'm one of those guys who don't believe in starving to death in a delicatessen store----\"\n\nMalcolm looked after the pair in amazement. It was the little man whom he had befriended in the courtyard at Charing Cross station. Other people drifted through the door in ones and twos, and then a man came walking smartly across the street, betraying the soldier at every stride. Malcolm turned and strolled in his direction.\n\nThere was no mistaking him either, though he was muffled up to the chin. With his tight-waisted greatcoat, a glimpse of an olive face with two piercing dark eyes, which flashed an inquiring glance as they passed--there was no excuse for error. It was Colonel Prince Serganoff beyond a doubt.\n\nA quarter of an hour later came the real shock of the evening. A girl was almost on top of him before he saw her, for she was wearing shoes which made no sound. He had only time to turn so that she did not see his face, before she too entered the door and passed in. The Grand Duchess! And Serganoff! And the American adventurer!\n\nWhat had these three in common, he wondered. And now he recalled the warning of the old man. Perhaps the girl was in danger--the thought brought him to the door, with his hand raised and touching the bell-push before he realized his folly. There was nothing to do but wait.\n\nFive minutes passed and ten minutes, and then Malcolm Hay became conscious of the fact that something unusual was happening in the street. It was more thickly populated. Half a dozen men had appeared at either end of the street and were moving slowly towards him, as though----\n\nAnd then in a flash he realized just what was happening. It was a police raid. In his student days he had seen such a raid upon a gambling house, and he recognized all the signs. He first thought of the girl--she must not be involved in this. He raced toward the door, but somebody had ran quicker, and his hand was on the bell-push when he was swung violently backwards, and an authoritative voice said:\n\n\"Take that man, sergeant.\"\n\nA hand gripped his shoulder and somebody peered in his face.\n\n\"Why, he's English,\" he said in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" gasped Malcolm. \"I'm sorry to interfere, but there is a lady in there, in whom I'm rather interested--you're raiding this club, aren't you?\"\n\n\"That's about the size of it,\" said a man in civilian clothes; and then, suspiciously, \"Who are you?\"\n\nMalcolm explained his status and calling.\n\n\"Take my advice and get away. Don't be mixed up in this business,\" said the officer. \"You can release him, sergeant. What's the time?\"\n\nA clock struck at that moment, and the officer in charge of the raid pressed the bell.\n\n\"If you've a lady friend involved in this, perhaps you'd like to stand by,\" he said. \"She may want you to bail her out,\" he added good-humouredly.",
    "She spoke in Russian, and nobody moved. Then a voice said:\n\n\"Speak English, miss.\"\n\nShe turned and glanced gratefully at the stout little man with his grotesque Derby hat and his good-humoured smile.\n\n\"I have been brought here by a trick,\" she said breathlessly, \"by this man\"--she pointed to Serganoff. \"Will you help me leave? You're English, aren't you?\"\n\n\"American, miss,\" said Cherry Bim. \"And as for helping you, why, bless you, you can class me as your own little bodyguard.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Serganoff hoarsely, and instinctively, at the sight of the levelled revolver. Cherry's hands went up. \"You'll keep out of this and do not interfere,\" said Serganoff. \"You'll have all the trouble you want before this evening is through. Irene, come here.\"\n\nAt one side of the room was a narrow doorway, which most of the members believed led to a cupboard, but which a few knew was a safety bolt in case of trouble. The Prince had recognized the door by its description, and had edged his way towards it, taking the key from his pocket.\n\nHe gripped the girl by the waist, inserted the key and flung open the door. She struggled to escape, but the hand that held the key also held the revolver, and never once did it point anywhere but at Cherry Bim's anatomy.\n\n\"Help!\" cried the girl. \"This man is Serganoff, the Chief of Police at Petrograd----\"\n\nThere was a crash, and the sound of hurrying footsteps. A voice from the outer hall screamed, \"The police!\"\n\nAt that moment Serganoff dragged the girl through the doorway and slammed it behind him. They were in a small cellar, almost entirely filled with barrels, with only a narrow alley-way left to reach a farther door. He dragged her through this apartment, up a short flight of stairs. They were on the level of the restaurant, and the girl could hear the clatter of plates as he pushed her up another stairway and into a room. By its furniture she guessed it was a private dining-room. The blinds were drawn and she had no means of knowing whether the apartment overlooked the front or the back of the premises.\n\nHe stopped long enough to lock the door and then he turned to her, slipping off his mask.\n\n\"I thought you would recognize me,\" he said coolly.\n\n\"What does this outrage mean?\" asked the girl with heaving bosom. \"You shall pay for this, colonel.\"\n\n\"There will be a lot of payment to be made before this matter is through,\" he said calmly. \"Calm yourself, Irene. I have saved you from a great disgrace. Are you aware that, at the moment I brought you from that room, the English police were raiding it?\"\n\n\"I should not have been in the room but for you,\" she said, \"my father----\"\n\n\"It is about your father I want to speak,\" he said. \"Irene, I am the sole heir to your father's estate. Beyond the property which is settled on you, you have nothing. My affection for you is known and approved at Court.\"\n\n\"Your affection!\" she laughed bitterly. \"I'd as soon have the affection of a wolf!\"\n\n\"You could not have a more complete wolf than I,\" he said meaningly. \"Do you know what has happened to-night? An anarchist club in London has been raided, and the Grand Duchess Irene Yaroslav has been found in the company of men whose object is to destroy the monarchy.\"\n\nShe realized with a sickening sense of disaster all that it meant. She knew as well as he in what bad odour her father stood at Court, and guessed the steps which would be taken if this matter became public.\n\n\"I was brought here by a trick,\" she said steadily. \"A letter came to me, as I thought, from Israel Kensky----\"\n\n\"It was from me,\" he interrupted.\n\n\"And you planned the raid, of course?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"I planned the raid in the most promising circumstances,\" he said. \"The gentleman who offered to be your good knight is a well-known New York gun-man. He is wanted by the police, who probably have him in their custody at this moment. He was brought here to-night, and an offer was made to him, an offer of a large sum of money, on condition that he would destroy the Czar.\"\n\nShe gasped.\n\n\"You see, my little Irene, that when this gun-man's evidence is taken in court, matters will look very bad for the Yaroslav family.\"\n\n\"What do you propose?\" she asked.\n\n\"There are two alternatives,\" he said. \"The first is that I should arrest you and hand you over to the police. The second is that you should undertake most solemnly to marry me, in which case I will take you away from here.\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"Is there a third possibility?\" she asked, and he shook his head.\n\n\"My dear,\" he said familiarly as he flicked a speck of dust from his sleeve. \"I think you will take the easier way. None of these scum will betray you, thinking that you are one of themselves--as I happen to know, some of the best families in Russia are associated with plotters of this type. As for the American, who might be inclined to talk, in a few weeks he will be on his way to New York to serve a life sentence. I have been looking up his record, and particularly drew the attention of the English police to the fact that he would be here to-night.\"\n\nCherry Bim, creeping up the stairs in his stockinged feet--he had marked and shot the fuse-box to pieces before the police came in, and had burst his way through the door in the wall--heard the sound of voices in the little room and stopped to listen. It was not a thick door, and he could hear Serganoff's voice very clearly. He stooped down to the key-hole. Serganoff had not taken the key out, and it was an old-fashioned key, the end of which projected an eighth of an inch on the other side of the door. Cherry Bim felt in his pocket and produced a pair of peculiarly shaped nippers, and gripped the end of the key, turning it gently. Then he slipped his handy gun from his pocket and waited.",
    "Long before he had reached the street he heard the roar of the crowd, and knew that some kind of trouble was brewing. The street was filled with knots of men and women, and their faces by common attraction, were turned in one direction. The focal point was a densely packed crowd which swayed toward the gateway of a tall, grim-looking house, which he recognized as the home of the millionaire, Kensky.\n\nThe roar intensified to a continuous shriek of malignant hate. He saw sticks and fists brandished and heard above the scream of frenzied women the deep-throated \"Kill! Death to the Jew!\" which was not unfamiliar to one who knew Kieff in moments of religious excitement. It was no business of his, and he drew his horse to the side of the street and watched, wondering what part the black-bearded Russian priests, who were in force and who seemed to form the centre of each knot of idlers, were playing in this act of persecution.\n\nOn the outskirts of the crowd he observed a green and gold coat, and, its wearer turning his head, he recognized him as the swarthy menial who had ridden behind the Grand Duchess. He was as violent and as energetic as the most lawless, and seemed engaged in pushing men into the crowd and dragging forward hesitant bystanders to swell the throng which was pressing about the iron gates of the building.\n\nAnd then Malcolm saw something which brought his heart to his mouth, a white hand raised from above the bobbing black heads, a hand raised in appeal or command. Instinctively he knew its owner and spurred his horse into the throng, sending the people flying in all directions. There was a small clear space immediately before the door which enabled him to see the two chief actors in the drama long before he was within hailing distance.\n\nThe space was caused by a dead horse, as he afterwards discovered, but, for the moment, his eyes were fixed on the girl who stood with her back to the grille, shielding with her frail body a little old man, white-bearded and bent, who crouched behind her outstretched arms, his pale face streaming with blood. A broken key in the grille told the story of his foiled attempt to escape. Grimy hands clutched at Malcolm's knees as he drove through the press, a stone whistled past his ear and shrill voices uttered imprecations at the daring foreigner, but he swerved to left and right and made a way until the sight of the dead horse brought his frightened mount to a quivering standstill.\n\nHe leapt from the saddle and sprang to the girl's side, and to his amazement his appearance seemed to strike consternation into her heart.\n\n\"Why did you come? Get away as quickly as you can,\" she breathed. \"Oh, you were mad to come here!\"\n\n\"But--but you?\" he said.\n\n\"They will not hurt me,\" she said rapidly. \"It is the old man they want. Can you smash the lock and get him inside?\"\n\n\"Give us the book, Jew,\" yelled a deep voice above the babel of sound. \"Give us the book and you shall live! Lady! Magnificence! Make the old man give us the book!\"\n\nMalcolm took a flying kick at the gate and the lock yielded. He half lifted, half carried the old man and pushed inside, where another locked door confronted them.\n\n\"Have you a key?\" demanded Malcolm hurriedly. \"Quick!\"\n\nThe old man felt in his pocket with trembling fingers and in doing so he crept behind his guardian. Malcolm now turned and faced the crowd.\n\n\"Come in, for God's sake,\" he called to the girl, but she shook her head.\n\n\"They will not hurt me,\" she said over her shoulder; \"it is you!\"\n\nAt that moment Malcolm felt something heavy slipped into the loose pocket of his jacket and a quivering voice, harsh with fear, whispered in his ear:\n\n\"Keep it, _gospodar_. To-morrow I will come for it at the Grand Hotel at the middle hour!\"\n\nThe crowd was now surging forward and the girl was being pressed back into the little lobby by their weight. Suddenly the door opened with a crack and the old man slipped through.\n\n\"Come, come,\" he cried.\n\nMalcolm leapt forward, clasped the girl about the waist and swung her behind him.\n\nThe shrieks of the crowd broke and a new note crept into the pandemonium of sound, a note of fear. From outside came a clatter of hoofs on the cobbled roadway. There was a flash of red and white pennons, the glitter of steel lances and a glimpse of bottle-green coats as half a sotnia of Cossacks swept the street clear.\n\nThey looked at one another, the girl and the man, oblivious to the appeal of hand and voice which the old man in the doorway was offering.\n\n\"I think you are very brave,\" said the girl, \"or else very foolish. You do not know our Kieff people.\"\n\n\"I know them very well,\" he said grimly.\n\n\"It was equally foolish of me to interfere,\" she said quickly, \"and I ought not to blame you. They killed my horse.\"\n\nShe pointed to the dead horse lying before the doorway.\n\n\"Where was your servant?\" he asked, but she made no reply. He repeated the question, thinking she had not heard and being at some loss for any other topic of conversation.\n\n\"Let us go out,\" she said, ignoring the query, \"we are safe now.\"\n\nHe was following her when he remembered the packet in his pocket and turned to the old man.\n\n\"Here is your----\"\n\n\"No, no, no, keep it,\" whispered Israel Kensky. \"They may come again to-night! My daughter told them that I was carrying it. May she roast!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Malcolm curiously.\n\nThe old man's lips parted in a toothless smile.\n\n\"It is the 'Book of All-Power!'\"\n\nHe blinked up at Malcolm, peering into his face expectantly. \"They all desire it, _gospodar_, from the Grand Duke in his beautiful palace to the _moujik_ in his cellar--they all desire my lovely book! I trust you with it for one night, _gospodar_, because you are English. Ah, well, you are not Russian. Guard it closely, for it holds the secret of tears and of happiness. You shall learn how to make men and women your slaves and how to turn people into Jews, and how to make men and women adore you, ai, ai! There are recipes for beauty in my book which make plain women lovely and old men young!\"\n\nMalcolm could only stare.",
    "Malcolm looked up and down the deserted street and then caught the eye of the solitary _intooski_, a thoughtful-looking man with a short, square beard, looking monstrously stout in his padded green coat, the livery of the Moscow drosky driver. The man on the sidewalk smiled and walked across the pavement.\n\n\"Little brother,\" he said in fluent Russian, \"would you condescend to drive me to the Hotel du Bazar Slav?\"\n\nThe driver who had noted so approvingly the shape of Malcolm's shoulders did not immediately answer; then:\n\n\"British?--I thought you were.\"\n\nHe spoke excellent English, and Malcolm looked up at him bewildered.\n\n\"I seem to know your face, too--let me think.\"\n\nThe cab-driver tapped his bearded chin.\n\n\"I have it--Hay. I met you four years ago at a dinner party in Kieff--you are the manager of an oil company or something of the sort.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said the astonished young man, \"but--I don't exactly place you.\"\n\nThe drosky driver smiled.\n\n\"And yet I dined with you,\" he said. \"I sat next the Grand Duchess Irene--later, when war broke out, I invited you to my headquarters.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" Malcolm's jaw dropped. \"General Malinkoff!\"\n\n\"Commanding the 84th Caucasian Division,\" said the bearded man dryly, \"and now commanding one little horse. If you will get into my excellent cab I will drive you to a restaurant where we may eat and drink and be almost merry for--fifty roubles.\"\n\nMalcolm stepped into the little drosky like a man in a dream. Malinkoff! He remembered him, a fine figure on a horse, riding through Kieff at the head of a glittering throng of staff officers. There was a function at the Grand Hotel to meet the new Commander, a great parade at that ancient palace in his honour--Malcolm had come in from the oil-fields partly to meet him at dinner--partly for news of one who had of a sudden vanished from his life.\n\nThe drosky drove furiously through the east end of the town, and the passenger noted that the driver was careful to avoid the big thoroughfares which led to the Krasnaya Plotzad and that centre of Moscow which is the Kremlin. Presently it drew up before a small eating-house in a poor street, and the driver hoisted himself to the ground. He left his horse unattended and, leading the way, pushed open the swing doors of the restaurant and passed down a long, low-ceilinged room crowded with diners, to a table at the far end.\n\n\"Sit down, Mr. Hay. I can promise you a fair but by no means sybarite feast--good morning, Nicholas Vassilitsky.\"\n\nHe nodded pleasantly to a grey-haired man in a workman's blouse sitting at the next table, and the man addressed rose stiffly, bowed and sat down.\n\n\"If you wish your clothes valeted whilst you are in Moscow, I recommend my friend,\" said the driver, snapping his fingers towards a stout waitress. \"Colonel Nicholas Vassilitsky is not only an excellent Director of Military Intelligence but he can press a pair of trousers with any man.\"\n\nHe gave his orders briefly, and turned to his companion.\n\n\"First of all, let me interrogate you. You are on your way to Petrograd?\"\n\n\"Yes--I am on my way home. During the war I have been controlling allied supplies in Little Russia--the Revolution stopped that.\"\n\n\"Fortunate man--to have a country,\" said General Malinkoff, and he spoke seriously and without bitterness. \"A country and an army--coherent, disciplined comrades in arms.\"\n\nHe shrugged his padded shoulders.\n\n\"Yes--you are on your way to your home? It will take you months to leave the country--if you ever leave it. I tried to leave last month. I am a reactionary with a leaning toward discipline. I cannot breathe the air of democracy. I used to think I had Liberal ideas. There was a time when I thought that a day would dawn when the world would be a great United States of Free People. Ah, well--I am still a reactionary.\"\n\nMalcolm knew that behind those grave eyes was a world of laughter, that beneath the solemn words was a gentle irony, and yet for the while he could not distinguish how much of tragedy there was in the man's fun.\n\n\"But why are you----\"\n\n\"Driving a cab?\" The general finished the sentence. \"Because, my friend, I am human. I must eat, for example; I must have a room to sleep in. I need cigarettes, and clean shirts at least three times a week--for God's sake never let that be known. I must also have warm clothes for the winter--in fact, I must live.\"\n\n\"But haven't you--money?\" Malcolm felt all a decent man's embarrassment. \"Forgive me butting into your affairs, but naturally I'm rather hazed.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" laughed the general. \"A bottle of kavass, my peach of Turkistan, and a glass for our comrade.\"\n\n\"Long live the Revolution!\" wheezed the waitress mechanically.\n\n\"Long may it live, little mother!\" responded the general.\n\nWhen the girl had gone he squared round to his companion.\n\n\"I have no shame, Mr. Hay--I'm going to let you pay for your own dinner because I cannot in these democratic times pauperize you by paying for you. No, I have no money. My balance in the State bank has been confiscated to the sacred cause of the people. My estate, a hundred versts or so from Moscow, confiscated to the sacred cause of the Revolution, my house in Petrograd is commandeered to the sacred service of the Soviet.\"\n\n\"But your command?\"\n\nThe general did not smile now. He laid down his knife and fork and threw a glance behind him.\n\n\"The men began shooting their officers in March, 1917,\" he said, lowering his voice. \"They executed the divisional staff in May--the democratic spirit was of slow growth. They spared me because I had written a book in my youth urging popular government and had been confined in the fortess of Vilna for my crime. When the army was disbanded I came to Moscow, and the cab was given to me by a former groom of mine, one Isaac Mosservitch, who is now a judge of the high court and dispenses pretty good law, though he cannot sign his own name.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hay,\" he went on earnestly, \"you did wrong to come to Moscow. Get back to Kieff and strike down into the Caucasus. You can reach the American posts outside of Tiflis. You'll never leave Russia. The Bolsheviks have gone mad--blood-mad, murder-mad. Every foreigner is suspect. The Americans and the English are being arrested. I can get you a passport that will carry you to Odessa, and you can reach Batoum, and Baku from there.\"\n\nMalcolm leant back in his chair and looked thoughtfully at the other.\n\n\"Is it so bad?\"\n\n\"Bad! Moscow is a mad-house. Listen--do you hear anything?\"\n\nAbove the hum of conversation Malcolm caught a sound like the cracking of whips.\n\n\"Rifle-firing,\" said the general calmly. \"There's a counter-revolution in progress. The advanced Anarchists are in revolt against the Bolsheviks. There is a counter-revolution every morning. We cab-drivers meet after breakfast each day and decide amongst ourselves which of the streets shall be avoided. We are pretty well informed--Prince Dalgoursky, who was a captain in the Preopojensky Guard, sells newspapers outside the Soviet headquarters, and the comrades give him tips. One of these days the comrades will shoot him, but for the moment he is in favour, and makes as much as a hundred roubles a day.\"",
    "There were a dozen men in the room in stained military overcoats and red armlets. One, evidently an officer, who carried a black portfolio under his arm, was leaning against the panelled wall, smoking and snapping his fingers to a dingy white terrier that leapt to his repeated invitations. At the table, covered with documents, were two people, the man and the woman.\n\nShe, sprawling indolently forward, her head upon her arm, her strong brown face turned to the man, was obviously a Jewess. The papers were streaked and greasy where her thick black ringlets had rested, and the ashes of her cigarette lay in little untidy heaps on the table.\n\nThe man was burly, with a great breadth of shoulder and big rough hands. But it was his face which arrested the feet of Malcolm and brought him to a sudden halt the moment he came near enough to see and recognize the Commissary.\n\nIt was not by his bushy red beard nor the stiff, upstanding hair, but by the crooked nose, that he recognized Boolba, sometime serving-man to the Grand Duke Yaroslav. Malcolm, looking at the sightless eyes, felt his spine go creepy.\n\nBoolba lifted his head sharply at the sound of an unfamiliar footfall.\n\n\"Who is this?\" he asked. \"Sophia Kensky, you who are my eyes, tell me who is this?\"\n\n\"Oh, a boorjoo,\" said the woman lazily.\n\n\"A foreigner too--who are you, boorjoo?\"\n\n\"A Britisher,\" said Malcolm.\n\nBoolba lifted his chin and turned his face at the voice.\n\n\"A Britisher,\" he repeated slowly. \"The man on the oil-fields. Tell me your name.\"\n\n\"Hay--Malcolm Hay,\" said Malcolm, and Boolba nodded.\n\nHis face was like a mask and he expressed no emotion.\n\n\"And the other?\"\n\n\"Malinkoff!\" snapped the voice at Malcolm's side, and Boolba nodded.\n\n\"Commanding an army--I remember. You drive a cab, comrade. Are there any complaints against this man?\"\n\nHe turned his face to Sophia Kensky, and she shook her head.\n\n\"Are there any complaints against this man, Sophia?\" he repeated.\n\n\"None that I know. He is an aristocrat and a friend of the Romanoffs.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" The grunt sounded like a note of disappointment. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"The stranger wishes permission to remain in Moscow until he can find a train to the north,\" said Malinkoff.\n\nBoolba made no reply. He sat there, his elbows on the table, his fingers twining and untwining the thick red hair of his beard.\n\n\"Where does he sleep to-night?\" he asked after awhile.\n\n\"He sleeps in my stable, near the Vassalli Prospekt,\" said Malinkoff.\n\nBoolba turned to the woman, who was lighting a new cigarette from the end of the old one, and said something in a low, growling tone.\n\n\"Do as you wish, my little pigeon,\" she said audibly.\n\nAgain his hand went to his beard and his big mouth opened in meditation. Then he said curtly:\n\n\"Sit down.\"\n\nThere was no place to sit, and the two men fell back amongst the soldiers.\n\nAgain the two at the table consulted, and then Sophia Kensky called a name. The man in a faded officer's uniform came forward, his big black portfolio in his hand, and this he laid on the table, opening the flap and taking out a sheaf of papers.\n\n\"Read them to me, Sophia,\" said Boolba. \"Read their names.\"\n\nHe groped about on the table and found first a rubber stamp and then a small, flat ink-pad. Sophia lifted the first of the papers and spelt out the names.\n\n\"Mishka Sasanoff,\" she said, and the man growled.\n\n\"An upstart woman and very ugly,\" he said. \"I remember her. She used to whip her servants. Tell me, Sophia, my life, what has she done now?\"\n\n\"Plotted to destroy the Revolution,\" said the woman.\n\n\"Huh!\" grunted the man, as he brought his rubber stamp to the paper, passing it across to the waiting officer, who replaced it in his portfolio. \"And the next?\"\n\n\"Paul Geslkin,\" she said and passed the document to him. \"Plotting to overthrow the Revolution.\"\n\n\"A boorjoo, a tricky young man, in league with the priests,\" he said, and again his stamp came down upon the paper, and again the paper went across the table into the portfolio of the officer.\n\nThe soldiers about Malcolm and his friend had edged away, and they were alone.\n\n\"What are these?\" whispered Malcolm.\n\n\"Death warrants,\" replied Malinkoff laconically, and for the second time a cold chill ran down Malcolm's spine.\n\nName after name were read out, and the little rubber stamp, which carried death to one and sorrow to so many, thudded down upon the paper. Malcolm felt physically ill. The room was close and reeked of vile tobacco fumes. There was no ventilation, and the oil lamps made the apartment insufferably hot. An hour, two hours passed, and no further notice was paid to the two men.\n\n\"I can't understand it quite,\" said Malinkoff in a low voice. \"Ordinarily this would mean serious trouble, but if the Commissary had any suspicion of you or me, we should have been in prison an hour ago.\"\n\nThen suddenly Boolba rose.\n\n\"What is the hour?\" he said.\n\nA dozen voices replied.\n\n\"Half-past ten? It is time that the sweeper was here.\"\n\nHe threw back his head and laughed, and the men joined in the laughter. With a great yellow handkerchief, which reminded Malcolm of something particularly unpleasant, Boolba wiped the streams from his sightless eyes and bent down to the woman at his side, and Malcolm heard him say: \"What is his name--he told me,\" and then he stood up.\n\n\"Hay,\" he said, \"you are a boorjoo. You have ordered many men to sweep your room. Is it not good that a house should be clean, eh?\"\n\n\"Very good, Boolba,\" said Malcolm quietly.\n\n\"Boolba he calls me. He remembers well. That is good! I stood behind him, comrades, giving wine and coffee and bowing to this great English lord! Yes, I, Boolba!\" he struck his chest, \"crawled on my knees to this man, and he calls me Boolba now--Boolba!\" he roared ferociously. \"Come here! Do this! Clean my boots, Boolba! Come, little Boolba, bow thy neck that I may rest my foot!\"\n\nA voice from the door interrupted him.\n\n\"Good!\" he said. \"My sweeper has arrived, Hay. Once a day she sweeps my room and once a day she makes my bed. No ordinary woman will satisfy Boolba. She must come in her furs, drive in her fine carriage from the Nijitnkaya--behold!\"",
    "Irene Yaroslav came back to the home which had always been associated in her mind with unhappy memories, to meet the culminating disaster which Fate had wrought. Whatever thoughts of escape she may have treasured in secret were cut into by the sure knowledge that she was watched day and night, and were now finally terminated by the discovery that the big apartment house, a suite of which Boolba had taken for her disposal when he had ousted her from her father's house, was practically in possession of the Soviet Guard.\n\nShe drove to the palace with an undisguised escort of mounted men, one on either side of the carriage, one before and one behind, and went up the stairs--those grim stairs which had frightened her as a child and had filled her nights with dreams, passing on her way the now empty bureau which it had been Boolba's whim for her to keep.\n\nMaria Badisikaya, an officer of the Committee for the Suppression of the Counter-Revolution, formerly an operative in the Moscow Cigarette Company, was waiting in the small drawing-room which still retained some of its ancient splendour. Maria was a short, stumpy woman with a slight moustache and a wart on her chin, and was dressed in green satin, cut low to disclose her generous figure. About her stiff, coal-black hair was a heavy diamond bandeau. She was sitting on a settee, her feet hardly touching the ground, cleaning her nails with a little pocket-knife as the girl entered. Evidently this was her maid of honour, and she could have laughed.\n\nThe woman glowered up at her and jumped briskly to her feet, closing the knife and slipping it into her corsage.\n\n\"You are late, Irene Yaroslav,\" she said shrilly. \"I have something better to do than to sit here waiting for a boorjoo. There is a committee meeting at ten o'clock to-night. How do you imagine I can attend that? Come, come!\"\n\nShe bustled into an ante-room.\n\n\"Here is your dress, my little bride. See, there is everything, even to stockings--Boolba has thought of all, yet he will not see! La! la! What a man!\"\n\nNumerous articles of attire were laid out on chairs and on the back of the sofa, and the girl, looking at them, shuddered. It was Boolba's idea--nobody but Boolba would have thought of it. Every garment was of red, blood red, a red which seemed to fill the room with harsh sound. Stockings of finest silk, shoes of russian leather, cobweb underwear--but all of the same hideous hue. In Russia the word \"red\" is also the word \"beautiful.\" In a language in which so many delicate shades of meaning can be expressed, this word serves a double purpose, doing duty for that which, in the eyes of civilized people, is garish, and that which is almost divine.\n\nMaria's manner changed suddenly. From the impatient, slightly pompous official, conscious of her position, she became obsequious and even affectionate. Possibly she remembered that the girl was to become the wife of the most powerful man in Moscow, whose word was amply sufficient to send even Gregory Prodol to the execution yard, and Gregory's position seemed unassailable.\n\n\"I will help you to dress, my little dear,\" she said. \"Let me take your hat, my little dove.\"\n\n\"I would rather be alone,\" said the girl. \"Will you please wait in the next room, Maria Badisikaya?\"\n\n\"But I can help you so, my little darling,\" said the woman, fussing about. \"A bride has no luck for thirty years if she puts on her own stockings.\"\n\n\"Go!\" said the girl imperiously, and the woman cringed.\n\n\"Certainly, Excellenz,\" she stammered, and went out without another word.\n\nThe girl changed quickly, and surveyed herself in the pier glass at the end of the room. It was striking but horrible. There came a tap at the door and the agitated Maria entered.\n\n\"He has sent for you, my little dove,\" she said. \"Come, take my arm. Do not tremble, my little pretty. Boolba is a good man and the greatest man in Moscow.\"\n\nShe would have taken the girl's arm, but Irene waved her aside, and walked swiftly from the drawing-room into the grand saloon. She wanted the ordeal over as soon as possible.\n\nThe room was crowded, and though many of the electric lamps in the great glass chandelier were not in working order and a broken fuse had put half the wall brackets in darkness, the light was almost dazzling. This wonderful saloon, where ten Czars had eaten bread and salt with ten generations of Yaroslavs, was thick with humanity. Some of the men were in uniform, some were in a nondescript costume which was the Soviet compromise between evening-dress and diplomatic uniform. One man wore a correct evening-jacket and a white waistcoat with a perfectly starched shirt, over uniform trousers and top-boots. The women were as weirdly clothed. Some were shabby to the point of rags, a few wore court dresses of the approved pattern, and there was one woman dressed like a man, who smoked all the time. The air was blue with tobacco smoke and buzzing with sound.\n\nAs she came into the saloon somebody shouted her name, and there was vigorous applause, not for her, she knew, nor for the name she bore, but for the novelty and the \"beauty\" of her wedding gown.\n\nAt the farther end of the room was a table covered with a red cloth, and behind it sat a man in evening-dress, whom she recognized as one of the newly-appointed magistrates of the city. Nudged behind by Maria, she made her way through the press of people, whose admiring comments were spoken loud enough for her to hear.\n\n\"What a little beauty! Too good for a blind man, eh?\"\n\n\"We have knelt for her many times, now she shall kneel for us.\"\n\n\"Such a dress! This Boolba is a wonderful fellow.\"\n\nShe halted before the table, her hands clasped lightly in front of her. Her head was high, and she met every glance steadily and disdainfully.\n\nThe clock struck a quarter after ten when Boolba made his entrance amidst a storm of applause.\n\nThey had never seen him in such a uniform before. Some thought it was a new costume which had been sanctioned by the supreme Soviet for its Commissaries; others that it had been planned especially for the marriage. Irene alone knew it, and a cold, disdainful smile lit for a moment her expressionless face.\n\nShe had seen Boolba in knee-breeches and white silk stockings before; she knew the coat of green and gold which the retainers of the house of Yaroslav wore on state occasions. Boolba was marrying her in his butler's livery--a delicate piece of vengeance.",
    "It was into the bureau that the man groped his way. A table had been set, crowded with bottles and glasses, piled with fruit, sweetmeats, and at the end the inevitable samovar.\n\"I will lock the door,\" said Boolba. \"Now you shall kiss me on the eyes and on the mouth and on the cheeks, making the holy cross.\"\nShe braced herself for the effort, and wrenched free. In a flash he came at her, and his hands caught the silken gown at the shoulder. She twisted under his arm, leaving a length of tattered and torn silk in his hand, and the marks of his finger-nails upon her white shoulder. He stopped and laughed--a low, gurgling laugh--and it was to the girl like the roar of some subterranean river heard from afar.\n\"Oh, Highness,\" he mocked, \"would you rob a blind man of his bride? Then let us be blind together!\"\nHe blundered to the door. There was a click, and the room was in darkness.\n\"I am better than you now,\" he said. \"I hear you in the dark; I can almost see you. You are by the corner of the table. Now you are pushing a chair. Little pigeon, come to me!\"\nWhilst he was talking she was safe because she could locate him. It was when he was silent that she was filled with wild fear. He moved as softly as a cat, and it seemed that his boast of seeing in the dark was almost justified. Once his hand brushed her and she shrank back only just in time. The man was breathing heavily now, and the old, mocking terms of endearment had changed.\n\"Come to me, Irene Yaroslav!\" he roared. \"Have I not often run to you? Have I not waited throughout the night to take your wraps and bring you coffee? Now you shall wait on me by Inokente! You shall be eyes and hands for me, and when I am tired of you, you shall go the way of Sophia Kensky.\"\nShe was edging her way to the door. Once she could switch on the light she was safe, at any rate for the time being. There was a long silence, and, try as she did, she could not locate him. He must have been crouching near the door, anticipating her move, for as her hand fell on the switch and the lights sprang into being, he leapt at her. She saw him, but too late to avoid his whirling hands. In a second he had her in his arms. The man was half mad. He cursed and blessed her alternately, called her his little pigeon and his little devil in the same breath. She felt the tickle of his beard against her bare shoulder, and strove to push him off.\n\"Come, my little peach,\" he said. \"Who shall say that there is no justice in Russia, when Yaroslav's daughter is the bride of Boolba!\"\nHis back was to the curtain, and he was half lifting, half drawing her to the two grey strips which marked its division, when the girl screamed.\n\"Again, again, my little dear,\" grinned Boolba. \"That is fine music.\"\nBut it was not her own danger which had provoked the cry. It was that vision, twice seen in her lifetime, of dead white hands, blue-veined, coming from the curtain and holding this time a scarlet cord.\nIt was about Boolba's neck before he realized what had happened. With a strangled cry he released the girl, and she fell back again on the table, overturning it with a crash.\n\"This way, Highness,\" said a hollow voice, and she darted through the curtains.\nShe heard the shock of Boolba's body as it fell to the ground, and then Israel Kensky darted past her, flung open the door and pushed her through.\n\"The servants' way,\" he said, and she ran to the narrow staircase which led below to the kitchen, and above to the attics in which the servants slept.",
    "Malcolm was the first to hear the sound of wheels on the roadway, and the party listened in silence till a low whistle sounded and their host darted out of the room.\n\"What was that?\" asked Malinkoff. \"Somebody has come to the front door.\"\nA few minutes later Petroff staggered through the doorway, carrying the limp figure of Irene. It was Malcolm who took the girl in his arms and laid her upon the sofa.\n\"She is not dead,\" said a voice behind him.\nHe looked up; it was Israel Kensky. The old man looked white and ill. He took the glass of wine which Ivan brought him with a shaking hand, and wiped his beard as he looked down at the girl. There was neither friendliness nor pity in his glance, only the curious tranquillity which comes to the face of a man who has done that which he set out to do.\n\"What of Boolba?\" asked Petroff eagerly.\n\"I think he lives,\" said Kensky, and shook his head. \"I am too weak and too old a man to have killed him. I put the cord about his neck and twisted it with a stick. If he can loosen the cord he will live; if he cannot, he will die. But I think he was too strong a man to die.\"\n\"Did he know it was you?\" asked Petroff.\nKensky shook his head.\n\"What is the hour?\" he asked, and they told him that it was two o'clock.\n\"Sophia Kensky dies at four,\" he said, in such a tone of unconcern that even Malinkoff stared at him.\n\"It is right that she should die,\" said Kensky, and they marvelled that he, who had risked his life to save one of the class which had persecuted his people for hundreds of years, should speak in so matter-of-fact tones about the fate of his own blood. \"She betrayed her race and her father. It is the old law of Israel, and it is a good law. I am going to sleep.\"\n\"Is there a chance that you have been followed?\" asked Malinkoff, and Kensky pulled at his beard thoughtfully.\n\"I passed a watchman at the barricade, and he was awake--that is the only danger.\"\nHe beckoned to Malcolm, and, loth as the young man was to leave the girl's side, now that she was showing some signs of recovering consciousness, he accompanied the old man from the room.\n\"_Gospodar_,\" said Israel Kensky (it sounded strange to hear that old title), \"once you carried a book for me.\"\n\"I remember.\" Malcolm smiled in spite of himself.\n\"'The Book of All-Power,'\" repeated the Jew quietly. \"It is in my room, and I shall ask you to repeat your service. That book I would give to the Grand Duchess, for I have neither kith nor child, and she has been kind to me.\"\n\"But surely, Kensky,\" protested Malcolm, \"you, as an intelligent man, do not believe in the potency of books or charms of incantations?\"\n\"I believe in the 'Book of All-Power,'\" said Kensky calmly. \"Remember, it is to become the property of the Grand Duchess Irene. I do not think I have long to live,\" he added. \"How my death will come I cannot tell, but it is not far off. Will you go with me now and take the book?\"\nMalcolm hesitated. He wanted to get back to the girl, but it would have been an ungracious act not to humour the old man, who had risked so much for the woman he loved. He climbed the stairs to the little bedroom, and waited at the door whilst Kensky went in. Presently the old man returned; the book was now stitched in a canvas wrapping, and Malcolm slipped the book into his pocket. The very act recalled another scene which had been acted a thousand miles away, and, it seemed, a million years ago.\n\"Now let us go down,\" said Kensky.\n\"Lord,\" he asked, as Malcolm's foot was on the stair, \"do you love this young woman?\"\nIt would have been the sheerest affectation on his part to have evaded the question.\n\"Yes, Israel Kensky,\" he replied, \"I love her,\" and the old man bowed his head.\n\"You are two Gentiles, and there is less difference in rank than in race,\" he said. \"I think you will be happy. May the Gods of Jacob and of Abraham and of David rest upon you and prosper you. Amen!\"\nNever had benediction been pronounced upon him that felt so real, or that brought such surprising comfort to the soul of Malcolm Hay. He felt as if, in that dingy stairway, he had received the very guerdon of manhood, and he went downstairs spiritually strengthened, and every doubt in his mind set at rest.\nThe girl half rose from the couch as he came to her, and in her queer, impulsive way put out both her hands. Five minutes before he might have hesitated; he might have been content to feel the warmth of her palms upon his. But now he knelt down by her side, and, slipping one arm about her, drew her head to his shoulder. He heard the long-drawn sigh of happiness, he felt her arm creep about his neck, and he forgot the world and all the evil and menace it held: he forgot the grave Malinkoff, the interested Cherry Bim, still wearing his Derby hat on the back of his head, and girt about with the weapons of his profession. He forgot everything except that the world was worth living for. There lay in his arms a fragrant and a beautiful thing.\nIt was Petroff who put an end to the little scene.\n\"I have sent food into the wood for you,\" he said, \"and my man has come back to tell me that your chauffeur is waiting by the car. He has all the petrol that he requires, and I do not think you should delay too long.\"\nThe girl struggled to a sitting position, and looked with dismay at her scarlet bridal dress.\n\"I cannot go like this,\" she said.\n\"I have your trunk in the house, Highness,\" said Petroff, and the girl jumped up with a little cry of joy.\n\"I had forgotten that,\" she said.\nShe had forgotten also that she was still weak, for she swayed and would have stumbled, had not Malcolm caught her.\n\"Go quickly, Highness,\" said Petroff urgently. \"I do not think it would be safe to stay here--safe for you or for Kensky. I have sent one of my men on a bicycle to watch the Moscow road.\"\n\"Is that necessary?\" asked Malinkoff. \"Are you suspect?\"\nPetroff nodded.",
    "They were in a stone hall, and the priest hesitated. Then he opened the door cautiously, and peeped in. The room was well illuminated; they could see the hanging kerosene lamps from where they stood.\n\"Come,\" said the priest's voice in a whisper, \"he is awake.\"\nMalcolm went first. The room, though bare, looked bright and warm; a big wood fire blazed in an open hearth, and before it stood a man dressed in a long blue military coat, his hands thrust into his pockets. The hood of the coat was drawn over his head, and his attitude was one of contemplation. Malcolm approached him.\n\"Excellenz,\" he began, \"we are travellers who desire----\"\nSlowly the man turned.\n\"Oh, you 'desire'!\" he bellowed. \"What do you desire, Comrade Hay? I will tell you what _I_ desire--my beautiful little lamb, my pretty little wife!\"\nIt was Boolba.\nCherry Bim, the last of the party to enter the room, made a dash for the door, and came face to face with the levelled rifle held in the hands of a soldier who had evidently been waiting the summons of Boolba's shout. Behind him were three other men. Cherry dropped to the ground as the man's rifle went off, shooting as he fell, and the man tumbled down. Scrambling to his feet, he burst through the doorway like a human cannon ball, but not even his nimble guns could save him this time. The hall was full of soldiers, and they bore him down by sheer weight.\nThey dragged him into the refectory, bleeding, and the diversion at any rate had had one good effect. Only Boolba was there, roaring and raging, groping a swift way round the walls, one hand searching, the other guiding.\n\"Where are they?\" he bellowed. \"Come to me, my little beauty. Hay! I will burn alive. Where are they?\"\n\"Little Commissary,\" said the leader of the soldiers, \"she is not here. They did not pass out.\"\n\"Search, search!\" shouted Boolba, striking at the man. \"Search, you pig!\"\n\"We have the other boorjoo,\" stammered the man.\n\"Search!\" yelled Boolba. \"There is a door near the fire--is it open?\"\nThe door lay in the shadow, and the man ran to look.\n\"It is open, comrade,\" he said.\n\"After them, after them!\"\nBoolba howled the words, and in terror they left their prisoner and flocked out of the door. Cherry stood in the centre of the room, his hands strapped behind his back, his shirt half ripped from his body, and looked up into the big blinded face which came peering towards him as though, by an effort of will, it could glimpse his enemy.\n\"You are there?\"\nBoolba's hands passed lightly over the gun-man's face, fell upon his shoulders, slipped down the arm.\n\"Is this the thief? Yes, yes; this is the thief. What is he doing?\"\nHe turned, not knowing that the soldiers had left him alone, and again his hands passed lightly over Cherry's face.\n\"This is good,\" he said, as he felt the bands on the wrists. \"To-morrow, little brother, you will be dead.\"\nHe might have spared himself his exercise and his reproaches, because to Cherry Bim's untutored ear his reviling was a mere jabber of meaningless words. Cherry was looking round to find something sharp enough on which to cut the strap which bound him, but there was nothing that looked like a knife in the room. He knew he had a minute, and probably less, to make his escape. His eyes rested for a moment on the holster at Boolba's belt, and he side-stepped.\n\"Where are you going?\"\nBoolba's heavy hand rested on his shoulder.\n\"Not out of the doorway, my little pigeon. I am blind, but----\"\nSo far he had got when Cherry turned in a flash, so that his back was toward Boolba. He stooped, and made a sudden dash backward, colliding with the Commissary, and in that second his hand had gripped the gun at Boolba's waist. There was a strap across the butt, but it broke with a jerk.\nThen followed a duel without parallel. Boolba pulled his second gun and fired, and, shooting as blindly, Cherry fired backward. He heard a groan over his shoulder and saw Boolba fall to his knees. Then he ran for the main door, stumbled past the state-bedroom of the monks, and into the chapel. It was his one chance that the priest had returned to his devotions, and he found the man on his knees.\n\"Percy,\" said Cherry, \"unfasten that strap.\"\nThe priest understood no language but his own. But a gesture, the strap about the wrists, blue and swollen, and the long revolver, needed no explanation. The strap fell off and Cherry rubbed his wrists.\nHe opened the breech of his gun; he had four shells left, but he was alone against at least twenty men. He guessed that Boolba had made the monastery his advance headquarters whilst he was waiting for news of the fugitives, and probably not twenty but two hundred were within call.\nHe reached the road and made for the place where the car had been left. If the others had escaped they also would go in that direction. He saw no guard or sentry, and heard no sound from the walled enclosure of the monastery. He struck against something in the roadway and stooped and picked it up. It was stitched in a canvas cover and it felt like a book. He suddenly remembered the scraps of conversation he had overheard between the girl and Malcolm.\nThis, then, was the \"Book of All-Power.\"\n\"Foolishness,\" said Cherry, and put it in his pocket. But the book showed one thing clearly--the others had got away. He had marked the place where they had stopped, but the car was gone!"

  "Talbot Mundy -- Told in the East": [
    "A Blood-red sun rested its huge disk upon a low mud wall that crested a rise to westward, and flattened at the bottom from its own weight apparently. A dozen dried-out false-acacia-trees shivered as the faintest puff in all the world of stifling wind moved through them; and a hundred thousand tiny squirrels kept up their aimless scampering in search of food that was not there.\n\nA coppersmith was about the only living thing that seemed to care whether the sun went down or not. He seemed in a hurry to get a job done, and his reiterated \"Bong-bong-bong!\"--that had never ceased since sunrise, and had driven nearly mad the few humans who were there to hear it--quickened and grew louder. At last Brown came out of a square mud house, to see about the sunset.\n\nHe was nobody but plain Bill Brown--or Sergeant William Brown, to give him his full name and entitlements--and the price of him was two rupees per day.\n\nHe stared straight at the dull red disk of the sun, and spat with eloquence. Then he wiped the sweat from his forehead, and scratched a place where the prickly heat was bothering him. Next, he buttoned up his tunic, and brushed it down neatly and precisely. There was official business to be done, and a man did that with due formality, heat or no heat.\n\n\"Guard, turn out!\" he ordered.\n\nTwelve men filed out, one behind the other, from the hut that he had left. They seemed to feel the heat more than Brown did, as they fell in line before Brown's sword. There was no flag, and no flag-pole in that nameless health-resort, so the sword, without its scabbard, was doing duty, point downward in the ground, as a totem-pole of Empire. Brown had stuck it there, like Boanerges' boots, and there it stayed from sunrise until sunset, to be displaced by whoever dared to do it, at his peril.\n\nThey had no clock. They had nothing, except the uniforms and arms of the Honorable East India Company, as issued in this year of Our Lord, 1857--a cooking-pot or two, a kettle, a little money and a butcher-knife. Their supper bleated miserably some twenty yards away, tied to a tree, and a lean Punjabi squatted near it in readiness to buy the skin. It was a big goat, but it was mangy, so he held only two annas in his hand. The other anna (in case that Brown should prove adamant) was twisted in the folds of his pugree, but he was prepared to perjure himself a dozen times, and take the names of all his female ancestors in vain, before he produced it.\n\nThe sun flattened a little more at the bottom, and began to move quickly, as it does in India--anxious apparently to get away from the day's ill deeds.\n\n\"Shoulder umms!\" commanded Brown. \"General salute! Present-umms!\"\n\nThe red sun slid below the sky-line, and the night was on them, as though somebody had shut the lid. Brown stepped to the sword, jerked it out of the ground and returned it to his scabbard in three motions.\n\n\"Shoulder-umms! Order-umms! Dismiss!\" The men filed back into the hut again, disconsolately, without swearing and without mirth. They had put the sun to bed with proper military decency. They would have seen humor--perhaps--or an excuse for blasphemy in the omission of such a detail, but it was much too hot to swear at the execution of it.\n\nBesides, Brown was a strange individual who detested swearing, and it was a very useful thing, and wise, to humor him. He had a way of his own, and usually got it.\n\nBrown posted a sentry at the hut-door, and another at the crossroads which he was to guard, then went round behind the but to bargain with the goatskin-merchant. But he stopped before he reached the tree.\n\n\"Boy!\" he called, and a low-caste native servant came toward him at a run.\n\n\"Is that fakir there still?\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib!\"\n\n\"Ha? Can't you learn to say 'yes,' like a human being?\"\n\n\"Yes, sahib!\"\n\n\"All right. I'm going to have a talk with him. Kill the goat, and tell the Punjabi to wait, if he wants to buy the skin.\"\n\n\"Ha, sahib!\"\n\nBrown spun round on his heel, and the servant wilted.\n\n\"Yes, sahib!\" he corrected.\n\nBrown left him then, with a nod that conveyed remission of cardinal sin, and a warning not to repeat the offence. As the native ran off to get the butcher-knife and sharpen it, it was noticeable that he wore a chastened look.\n\n\"Send Sidiki after me!\" Brown shouted after him, and a minute later a nearly naked Beluchi struck a match and emerged from the darkness, with the light of a lantern gleaming on his skin. He followed like a snake, and only Brown's sharp, authority-conveying footfalls could be heard as he trudged sturdily--straight-backed, eyes straight in front of him--to where an age-old baobab loomed like a phantom in the night. He marched like a man in armor. Not even the terrific heat of a Central-Indian night could take the stiffening out of him.\n\n\nThe Beluchi ran ahead, just before they reached the tree. He stopped and held the lantern up to let its light fall on some object that was close against the tree-trunk. At a good ten-pace distance from the object Brown stopped and stared. The lamplight fell on two little dots that gleamed. Brown stepped two paces nearer. Two deadly, malicious human eyes blinked once, and then stared back at him.\n\n\n\"Does he never sleep?\" asked Brown.\n\n\nThe Beluchi said something or other in a language that was full of harsh hard gutturals, and the owner of the eyes chuckled. His voice seemed to be coming from the tree itself, and there was nothing of him visible except the cruel keen eyes that had not blinked once since Brown drew nearer.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Sahib, he does not answer.\"\n\n\"Tell him I'm tired of his not answering. Tell him that if he can't learn to give a civil answer to a civilly put question I'll exercise my authority on him!\"\n\nThe Beluchi translated, or pretended to. Brown was not sure which, for he was rewarded with nothing but another chuckle, which sounded like water gurgling down a drain.\n\n\"Does he still say nothing?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing, sahib.\"\n\nBrown stepped up closer yet, and peered into the blackness, looking straight into the eyes that glared at him, and from them down at the body of the owner of them. The Beluchi shrank away.\n\n\"Have a care, sahib! It is dangerous! This very holy--most holy--most religious man!\"\n\n\"Bring that lantern back.\"\n\n\"He will curse you, sahib!\"\n\n\"Do you hear me?\"\n\nThe Beluchi came nearer again, trembling with fright. Brown snatched the lamp away from him, and pushed it forward toward the fakir, moving it up and down to get a view of the whole of him. There was nothing that he saw that would reassure or comfort or please a devil even. It was ultradevilish; both by design and accident--conceived and calculated ghastliness, peculiar to India. Brown shuddered as he looked, and it took more than the merely horrible to make him betray emotion.",
    "An Indian city that has yet to have its mysterie's laid bare and banished by electric light is a stage deliberately set for massacre. The bazaars run criss-crosswise; any way at all save parallel, and anyhow but straight. Between them lies always a maze of passages, and alleys, deep sided, narrow, overhung by trellised windows and loopholed walls and guarded stairways.\n\nFor every square inch where the sun can shine there are a hundred where a man could hide unseen. Through century piled on suspicious century, no designer, no architect, no builder has neglected to provide a means of secret ingress, and still more secret egress, to each new house. And the newest house is built on secret passages that hid conspirators against the kings of men who lived before the oldest house was thought of.\n\nAfter the Mutiny of '57 came broader roads--so that a cannon might be trained along them.\n\nBut in '57, Jailpore was a nest of winding alley-ways and blind bat and rat holes, where weird smells and strange unlisted poisons and prophecies were born. In its midst, tight-packed in a roaring babel-din of many-colored markets, stood a stone-walled palace, built once by a Hindu king to commemorate a victory over Moslems, added to by a Moslem Nizam, to celebrate his conquest of the Hindus and added to once again by the Honorable East India Company, to make a suitable barracks for its native troops.\n\nFrom the rat-infested slums, from the hot shadows and the mazy back-bazaars, from temples, store-houses, shops, and from the sin-steeped underworld, there screamed and surged and swept the many-graded, many-minded polyglot rebellion-spume. A quarter of a million underdogs had turned against their masters. A hundred factions and as many more religions, all had one common end in view--to loot. All were agreed on one thing--that the first stage of the game must be to turn Jailpore and, after Jailpore, India, into a charnel-house.\n\nAround and around the burning palace the mob screamed and swept uncontrolled. Moslem looted Hindu, and Hindu Moslem. Armed sepoys, with the blood of their British officers fresh-soaked on their British uniforms, and the unspent pay of \"John Company\" still jingling in their pockets, danced weird, wild devil-dances through the streets, clearing their way, when they saw fit, with cold steel or wanton volleys. Women screamed. Caste looted caste. Loose horses galloped madly through the streets. Here and there a pitched battle raged, where a merchant who had wealth had also courage, and apprentices and friends to help him defend his store.\n\nAnd through all the din and clamor, under and above the howling and the volleys and the roar of flames, sounded the steady thumping of the sacred war-drums. The whole sky glowed red. The Indian night was scorched and smoked and lit by arson. Hell screamed with the cooking of red mutiny, and throbbed with the thunder of the sacred temple-drums. And that was only one of the hells, and a small one. India glowed red that night from end to end!\n\nJuggut Khan, free-lance Rajput and gentleman of fortune, had ridden out of that caldron of Jailpore. His house was a heap of glowing ashes, and his goods were tossed for and distributed among a company. But his mark lay indelibly impressed upon the town. There were three European women and a child who were nowhere to be found; and there was a trail that led from somewhere near the palace to the western gate. It was a red trail.\n\nIn one spot lay a sepoy pierced through by a lance, and with half of the lance-shaft still standing upright in him. That had been bad art--sheer playing to the gallery! Juggut Khan had run him through and tried to lift him on the lance-end for a trophy. It was luck that saved the day for him that time, not swordsmanship.\n\nBut a man who has done what he had done that day may be forgiven. There lay nine other men behind him where his lance was left, and each of them lay face upward with a round red hole in his anatomy where the lance had entered.\n\nAnd from the point where he had broken his lance and left it, up to where a self-appointed guard had refused at first to open the city gate for him, there was a trail that did honor to the man who taught him swordsmanship. One man lay headless, and another's head was only part of him, because the sword had split it down the middle and the two halves were still joined together at the neck.\n\nThere were men who claimed afterward that of the twenty-three who lay between his lance-shaft and the city gate, some five or six had been slain in brawls and looting forays. And Juggut Khan was never known to discuss the matter. But the fact remains that every man of them was killed by the blade or point of a cavalry-saber, and that Juggut Khan broke out of the place untouched.\n\nAnd another fact worthy of record is, that underneath a stone floor, in a building that was partly powder-magazine-surrounded at every end and side by mutineers who searched for them, and very nearly stifled by the dust of decaying ages--there lay three women and a child, with a jar of water close beside them and a sack of hastily collected things to eat. They lay there in all but furnace-heat, close-huddled in the darkness, and they shuddered and sobbed and blessed Juggut Khan alternately. Below them the whispering echoes sighed mysteriously through a maze of tunnels. Around them, and around their sack of food, the rats scampered. Above them, where a ten-ton stone trapdoor lay closed over their heads, black powder stood in heaps and sacks and barrels. Closing the trapdoor had been easy. One pushed it and it fell. Not all the mutineers in Jailpore nor Juggut Khan nor any one could open it again without the secret. And no man living knew the secret. The three women and the child were safe from immediate intrusion!",
    "The blazing roof of the guardroom lit up even the crossroads for a while, and Brown and his men could see that for the present there was a good wide open space between them and the enemy. The firelight showed a tree not far from the crossroads, and since anything is cover to men who are surrounded, Brown marched his men toward it and halted them there.\n\n\"Form single rank!\" commanded Brown.\n\nThere was no response. They stood there fixed like a row of chickens staring at a snake!\n\n\"Form single rank!\"\n\nHe leaped at them, and broke the first rule of the service--as a man may when he is man enough, and the alternative would be black shame.\n\nHis fist was a hard one and heavy, and they felt the weight of it.\n\n\"Form single rank! Take one pace open order! Extend! Now, forward--by the right! Right dress, there!\"\n\nHe marched in front of them, and they followed him for very shame, now that he had broken their paralysis.\n\n\"Halt! Port-arms! Charge bayonets!\"\n\nHe was peering at something in the dark, something that chuckled and smelled horrible, and sat unusually still for anything that lived.\n\n\"Numbers One, Two, Three--left wheel--forward! Halt! Numbers Seven, Eight, Nine--right wheel--forward! Halt!\"\n\nThey were standing now on three sides of a square. The fourth side was the trunk of the baobab. Between them and the trunk, the streaming tendrils swayed and swung, bats flitted and something still invisible sat still and chuckled.\n\n\"One pace forward--march!\"\n\nThey could see now. The fakir sat and stared at them and grinned. Brown raised the lamp and let its rays fall on him. The light glinted off his eyes, and off the only other part of him that shone--the long, curved, ghastly fingernails that had grown through the palm of his upstretched hand.\n\n\"How did you get here?\" demanded Brown, not afraid to speak, for fear that fright would take possession of himself as well as of his men, but quite well aware that the fakir would not answer him. Then he remembered the Beluchi.\n\n\"Ask him, you! Ask him how he came here.\"\n\nThe Beluchi found his tongue, and stammered out a question. The fakir chuckled, and following his chuckle let a guttural remark escape him.\n\n\"He says, sahib, that he flew!\"\n\n\"Ask him, could he fly with nine fixed bayonets in him!\"\n\nThere was a little laughter from the men at that sally. It takes very little in the way of humor to dispel a sense of the uncanny or mysterious.\n\n\"He answers, sahib, that you have seen what comes of striking him. He asks how many dead there be.\"\n\n\"Does he want me to hold him answerable for those men's lives?\"\n\n\"He says he cares not, sahib! He says that he has promised what shall befall you, sahib, before a day is past--you and one other!\"\n\n\"Ask him, where is the Punjabi skin-buyer?\"\n\nThe fakir chuckled at that question, and let out suddenly a long, low, hollow-sounding howl, like a she-wolf's just at sundown. He was answered by another howl from near the guardroom, and every soldier faced about as though a wasp had stung him.\n\n\"Front!\" commanded Brown. \"Now, one of you, about turn! Keep watch that way! Is that the Punjabi?--ask him.\"\n\n\"He says 'Yes!' sahib. He and others!\"\n\n\"Very well. Now tell him that unless he obeys my orders on the jump, word for word as I give them, I'll hang him as high as Haman by that withered arm of his, and have him beaten on the toenails with a cleaning-rod before I fill him so full of bayonet-holes that the vultures'll take him for a sponge! Say I'm a man of my word, and don't exaggerate.\"\n\nThe Beluchi translated.\n\n\"He says you dare not, sahib!\"\n\n\"Advise him to talk sense.\"\n\n\"He says, sahib, 'You have had one lesson!\"'\n\n\"Now it's my turn to give him one. Men! We'll have to give up that sleep I talked about. This limping dummy of a fakir thinks he's got us frightened, and we've got to teach him different. There's some reason why we're not being attacked as yet. There's something fishy going on, and this swab's at the bottom of it! We want him, too, on a charge of murder, or instigating murder, and the guardroom's the best place for him. To the guardroom with him. He'll do for a hostage anyhow. And where he is, I've a notion that the control of this treachery won't be far away! Grab him below the arms and by the legs. One of you hold a bayonet-point against his ribs. The rest, face each way on guard. Now--all together, forward to the guardroom--march!\"\n\nThe fakir howled. Ululating howls replied from the surrounding night, and once a red light showed for a second and disappeared in front of them. Then the fakir howled again.\n\n\"Look, sahib! See! The guardroom!\"\n\nIt was the Beluchi who saw it first--the one who was most afraid of things in general and the least afraid of Sergeant Brown. A little flame had started in the thatch.\n\n\"Halt!\" ordered Brown. \"Two of you hold the fakir! The remainder--volley-firing--kneeling--point-blank-range. Ready--as you were--independent firing--ready! Now, wait till you see 'em in the firelight, then blaze away all you like!\"\n\nHis last words were cut off short by the sound of rifle-fire. Each rifle in turn barked out, and three rifles answered from the night.\n\n\"Let that fakir feel a bayonet-point, somebody!\"\n\nThe fakir cursed between his teeth, in proof of prompt obedience by one of the men who held him.\n\n\"Tell him to order his crowd to cease fire!\"\n\nThe Beluchi translated, and the fakir howled again. The flames leaped through the thatch, and in a minute more the countryside was lit for half a mile or more by the glare of the burning guardroom.\n\nThe flames betrayed more than a hundred turbaned men, who hugged the shadows.\n\n\"Keep that bayonet-point against his ribs. See? That comes o' moving instead o' sitting still! If we'd shut ourselves in the guardroom there, we'd have been merrily roasting in there now! We stole a march on them. Beauty here was sitting on his throne to see the fun. Didn't expect us. Thought we'd be all hiding under the beds, like Sidiki here! Goes to prove the worst thing that a soldier can do is to sit still when there's trouble. We're better off than ever. We're free and they won't dare do much to us as long as we've got Sacred-Smells-and-Stinks in charge. Form up round him, men, and keep your eyes skinned till morning!\"",
    "He held up one frayed end of a manila rope, that was wound around the tree-trunk. Some tethered ox had rendered them that service. \"Fifty feet of good manila, and a fakir that needs hanging! Anybody see the connection?\" There was a chorus of ready laughter, and the two men who had the unenviable task of carrying the fakir picked him up and tossed him to the tree-trunk. The roof of the guardhouse was blazing fiercely, and now they had fired the other roofs. The fakir, the tree and the little bunch of men who held him prisoner were as plainly visible as though it had been daytime. A bullet pinged past Brown's ear, and buried itself in the tree-trunk with a thud. \"Let him feel that bayonet again!\" said Brown. A rifleman obeyed, and the fakir howled aloud. An answering howl from somewhere beyond the dancing shadows told that the fakir had been understood. \"And now,\" said Brown, paraphrasing the well-remembered wording of the drill-book, in another effort to get his men to laughing again, \"when hanging a fakir by numbers--at the word one, place the noose smartly round the fakir's neck. At the word two, the right-hand man takes the bight of the rope in the hollow of his left hand, and climbs the tree, waiting on the first branch suitable for the last sound of the word three. At the last sound of the word three, he slips the rope smartly over the bough of the tree and descends smartly to the ground, landing on the balls of his feet and coming to attention. At the word four, the remainder seize the loose end of the rope, being careful to hold it in such a way that the fakir has a chance to breathe. And at the last sound of the word five, you haul all together, lifting the fakir off the ground, and keeping him so until ordered to release. Now--one!\"\n\nHe had tied a noose while he was speaking, and the fakir had watched him with eyes that blazed with hate. A soldier seized the noose, and slipped it over the fakir's head. \"Two!\" The tree was an easy one to climb. \"Two\" and \"three\" were the work of not more than a minute. \"Four!\" commanded Brown, and the rope drew tight across the bough. The fakir had to strain his chin upward in order to draw his breath. \"Steady, now!\" The men were lined out in single file, each with his two hands on the rope. Not half of them were really needed to lift such a wizened load as the fakir, but Brown was doing nothing without thought, and wasting not an effort. He wanted each man to be occupied, and even amused. He wanted the audience, whom he could not see, but who he knew were all around him in the shadows, to get a full view of what was happening. They might not have seen so clearly, had he allowed one-half of the men to be lookers-on. \"Steady!\" he repeated. \"Be sure and let him breathe, until I give the word.\" Then he seized the cowering Beluchi by the neck, and dragged him up close beside the fakir. \"Translate, you!\" he ordered. \"To the crowd out yonder first. Shout to 'em, and be careful to make no mistakes.\"\n\n\"Speak, then, sahib! What shall I say?\"\n\n\"Say this. This most sacred person here is our prisoner. He will die the moment any one attempts to rescue him.\" The Beluchi translated, and repeated word for word. \"I will now talk with him, and he himself will talk with you, and thus we will come to an arrangement!\"' There was a commotion in the shadows, and somewhere in the neighborhood of fifty men appeared, keeping at a safe distance still, but evidently anxious to get nearer. \"Now talk to the fakir, and not so loudly! Ask him 'Are you a sacred person?' Ask him softly, now!\"\n\n\"He says 'Yes,' sahib, 'I am sacred!'\"\n\n\"Do you want to die?\"\n\n\"All men must die!\" The answer made an opening for an interminable discussion, of the kind that fakirs and their kindred love. But Brown was not bent just then on dissertation. He changed his tactics. \"Do you want to die, a little slowly, before all those obedient worshipers of yours, and in such a way that they will see and understand that you can not help yourself, and therefore are a fraud?\" The Beluchi repeated the question in the guttural tongue that apparently the fakir best understood. In the fitful light cast by the burning roofs, it was evident that the fakir had been touched in the one weak spot of his armor. There can scarcely be more than one reason why a man should torture himself and starve himself and maim and desecrate and horribly defile himself. At first sight, the reason sounds improbable, but consideration will confirm it. It is vanity, of an iron-bound kind, that makes the wandering fakir. \"Ask him again!\" said Brown. But again the fakir did not answer. \"Tell him that I'm going to let him save his face, provided he saves mine. Explain that I, too, have men who think I am something more than human!\" The Beluchi interpreted, and Brown thought that the fakir's eyes gleamed with something rather more than their ordinary baleful light. It might have been the dancing flames that lit them, but Brown thought he saw the dawn of reason. \"Say that if I let my men kill him, my men will believe me superhuman, and his men will know that he is only a man with a withered arm! But tell him this: He's got the best chance he ever had to perform a miracle, and have the whole of this province believe in him forevermore.\"\n\nAgain the fakir's eyes took on a keener than usual glare, as he listened to the Beluchi. He did not nod, though, and he made no other sign, beyond the involuntary evidence of understanding that his eyes betrayed. \"His men can see that noose round his neck, tell him. And his men know me, more or less, and British methods anyhow. They believe now, they're sure, they're positive that his neck's got about as much chance of escaping from that noose as a blind cow has of running from a tiger. Now then! Tell him this. Let him come the heavy fakir all he likes. Tell him to tell his gang that he's going to give an order. Let him tell them that when he says 'Hookum hai!' my men'll loose his neck straight away, and fall down flat. Only, first of all he's got to tell them that he needs us for the present. Let him say that he's got an extra-special awful death in store for us by and by, and that he's going to keep us by him until he's ready to work the miracle. Meantime, nobody's to touch us, or come near us, except to bring him and us food!\" The fakir listened, and said nothing. At a sign from Brown the rope tightened just a little. The fakir raised his chin. \"And tell him that, if he doesn't do what I say, and exactly what I say, and do it now, he's got just so long to live as it takes a man to choke his soul out!\" The fakir answered nothing. \"Just ever such a wee bit tighter, men!\" The fakir lost his balance, and had to scramble to his feet and stand there swaying on his heels, clutching at the rope above him with his one uninjured hand, and sawing upward with his head for air. There came a murmur from the shadows, and a dozen breech-bolts clicked. There seemed no disposition to lie idle while the holiest thing in a temple-ridden province dangled in mid-air. \"In case of a rush,\" said Brown quietly, \"all but two of you let go! The remainder seize your rifles and fire independently. The two men on the rope, haul taut, and make fast to the tree-trunk. This tree's as good a place to die as anywhere, but he dies first! Understand?\"",
    "It is not easy to give any kind of real impression of India twenty-four hours after the outbreak of the mutiny. Movement was the keynote of the picture--stealthy, not-yet-quite-confident pack-movement on the one hand, concentrated here and there in blood-red eddies, and, on the other hand, swift, desperate marches in the open. The moment that the seriousness of the outbreak had been understood, and the orders had gone out by galloper to \"Get a move on!\" each commanding officer strained every nerve at once to strike where a blow would have the most effect. There was no thought of anything but action, and offensive, not defensive action. Until some one at the head of things proved still to be alive, and had had time to form a plan, each divisional commander acted as he saw fit. That was all that any one was asked to do at first: to act, to strike, to plunge in headlong where the mutiny was thickest and most dangerous, to do anything, in fact; except sit still. Even with the evidence of mutiny and treachery on every side, with red flames lighting the horizon and the stench of burning villages on every hand, the strange Anglo-Saxon quality persisted that has done more even that the fighting-quality to teach the English tongue to half the world. The native servants who had not yet run away retained their places still, unquestioned. When an Englishman has once made up his mind to trust another man, he trusts him to the hilt, whatever shade of brown or red or white his hide may be.\n\nBut, since every rule has its exceptions, there were some among the native servants, who remained ostensibly loyal to their masters, who would better have been shot or hanged at the first suggestion of an outbreak. For naturally a man who is trusted wrongly is far more dangerous than one who is held in suspicion. But it never was the slightest use endeavoring to persuade an average English officer that his own man could be anything but loyal. He may be a thief and a liar and a proved-up rogue in every other way; but as for fearing to let him sleep about the house, or fearing to let him cook his master's food, or fearing to let him carry firearms--well! Perhaps, it is conceit, or maybe just ordinary foolishness. It is not fear! So, in a country where the art of poisoning has baffled analysts since analysts have been invented, and where blood-hungry fanatic priests, both Hindu and Mohammedan, were preaching and promising the reward of highest heaven to all who could kill an Englishman or die in the attempt, a native cook whose antecedents were obscured in mystery cooked dinner for a British general, and marched with his column to perform the same service while the general tried to trounce the cook's friends and relatives! But General Baines felt perfectly at ease about his food. He never gave a thought to it, but ate what was brought to him, sitting his horse most likely, and chewing something as he rode among the men, and saw that they filled their bellies properly. He had made up his mind to march on Harumpore, and to take over the five-hundred-strong contingent there. Then he could swoop down on any of a dozen other points, in any one of which a blow would tell.\n\nHe was handicapped by knowing almost too much. He had watched so long, and had suspected for so long that some sort of rebellion was brewing that, now that it had come, his brain was busy with the tail-ends of a hundred scraps of plans. He was so busy wondering what might be happening to all the other men subordinate to him, who would have to be acting on their own initiative, that his own plans lacked something of directness. But there was no lack of decision, and no time was lost. The men marched, and marched their swiftest, in the dust-laden Indian heat. And he marched with them, in among them, and ate what the cook brought him, without a thought but for the best interests of the government he served. So they buried General Baines some eighty-and-twenty miles from Harumpore, and shot the cook. And, according to the easy Indian theology, the cook was wafted off to paradise, while General Baines betook himself to hell, or was betaken. But the column, three thousand perspiring Britons strong, continued marching, loaded down with haversacks and ammunition and resolve.\n\nIt was met, long before the jackals had dug down to General Baines' remains, by the advance-guard of Colonel Kendrick's column, which was coming out of Harumpore because things were not brisk enough in that place to keep it busy. Kendrick himself was riding with the cavalry detachment that led the way southward. \"Who's in command now?\" he asked, for they had told him of General Baines' death by poison. \"I am,\" said a gray-haired officer who rode up at that moment. \"I'm your senior, sir, by two years,\" answered Kendrick. \"Then you command, sir.\" \"Very good. Enough time's been wasted. The column can wait here until my main body reaches us. Then we'll march at once on Jailpore. This idea of leaving Jailpore to its fate is nonsense! The rebels are in strength there, and they have perpetrated an abominable outrage. There we will punish them, or else we'll all die in the attempt! If we have to raze Jailpore to the ground, and put every man in it to the sword before we find the four Europeans supposed to be left alive there, our duty is none the less obvious! Here comes my column. Tell the men to be ready to march in ten minutes.\" He turned his horse, to look through the dust at the approaching column, but the man who had been superseded touched him on the sleeve. \"What's that? Better have a rest? Tired out, you say? Oh! Form them all up in hollow square, then, and I'll say a few words to them. There are other ways of reviving a leg-weary column than by letting it lie down.\" Ten minutes later a dull roar rose up through a steel-shot dust-cloud, and three thousand helmets whirled upward, flashing in the sun. Three thousand weary men had given him his answer! There was no kind of handle to it; no reserve--nothing but generous and unconditional allegiance unto hunger, thirst, pain, weariness, disease or death. It takes a real commander to draw that kind of answer from a tired-out column, but it is a kind of answer, too, that makes commanders! It is not mere talk, on either side. It means that by some sixth sense a strong man and his men have discovered something that is good in each other.",
    "There were many more causes than one that worked together to make possible the entry of Brown and his little force into Jailpore. They were brave men; they were more than brave and they held the ace of trumps, as Brown had stated, in the person of the fakir known as \"He.\" But luck favored them as well, and but for luck they must have perished half a dozen times. They marched the whole of the first afternoon, and met no one. They only overtook little straggling parties of rebels, making one and all for Jailpore, who bolted at the sight of them, imagining them probably to be the advance-guard of a larger force. The very idiocy of marching eleven strong through a country infested by their enemies was in their favor. Nobody could believe that there were no more than eleven of them. Even the English could not be such lunatics!\n\nThat night, they rested for a while, and then went on again. During the day following they lay in a hollow between some trees and rested, and slept by turns. They suffered agonies from the heat, and not a little from hunger, and once or twice they were hard put to it to stop the Rajput's charger from neighing when a native pony passed along the nearby road. But night came again, and with it the screen of darkness for their strange, almost defenseless caravan. Once or twice the fakir tried to shout an alarm to passing villagers, but the quick and energetic application of a cleaning-rod by Brown stopped him always in the nick of time, and they came within sight of the battlements of Jailpore without an accident. Then, though, their problem became really serious, and it was a series of circumstances altogether out of their control and not connected with them that made their entry possible. The mutineers in Jailpore had learned that Kendrick sahib was coming down on them from the north by forced marches with thirty-five hundred men or more. They were putting the place into a state of siege, and getting ready by all means in their power to oppose him. Little attention was being paid to small parties of arrivals from no man knew or cared where. And, in a final effort to find the four who were the lure that was bringing Kendrick down on them, the city was once more being turned upside down and inside out, and men were even being tortured who were thought to know of hiding-places. With purely Eastern logic, the leaders of the rebels had decided that the sight of the bodies of the four, writhing in their last agony on the sun-scorched outer wall, would mightily discourage the British when they came. So no efforts were being spared and no stones left unturned to find them. The hooks on the wall were sharp and ready, so that they might be impaled without loss of time in full view of their would-be rescuers. Almost every secret passage of the thousand odd had been explored. In the hurry to run through them and explore the next one, doors had been left open here and there that had been kept closed in some instances for centuries. One door in particular, placed cornerwise in a buttress of the outer wall, was spotted by Juggut Khan as he circled round the city on his charger at dusk on the day following their arrival. He brought his charger back to where the others lay concealed, and then went on an exploring-expedition on foot--to discover that the outer city wall was like a sponge, a nest of honey-combed cells and passages wandering interminably in the fifty-foot-thick brick and rubble rampart.\n\nAnd while he searched amid the mazy windings of the wall, Bill Brown sat in the forked top of a tree and studied out the ground-plan of the city. He was imprinting landmarks in his memory for future reference, and trying--with a brain that ached from the apparent hopelessness of the task--to figure out a plan. He knew by now that the four he had come to rescue were hidden underneath the powder-magazine, and he could see the magazine itself. But he could think of no way of rescuing them, for the city absolutely boiled with frantic, mixed-up castes and creeds picked at random, and thrown in at random from the whole of India. A mouse could not have passed through the streets undetected! And yet, from a soldier's point of view, there were certain fascinating details to be noticed about that powder-magazine. In the first place, it had been constructed for a granary by an emperor who never heard of Joseph, but who had the same ideal plan for cornering the people's food-supply. And since labor had been unlimited, and cheap, he had gone about building the thing on the most thoroughly unpractical and most pretentious plan that he and his architects could figure out. It was big enough to hold about ten times as much grain as the province could grow in any one year of plenty. And, since that was the least practical and most ungranary-like shape, he had caused it to be built like an enormous beehive, with a tiny platform at the top. Winding round and round the huge stone dome, and on the outside, was a six-foot-wide trail, which was the elevator. Up this, each with a sack or a basket on his head, the population was to have been induced to run in single file, dumping its hard-won corn into the granary through an opening at the top until the granary was full.",
    "And so, above a stone-flagged courtyard, in a room that once had echoed to the laughter of a sultan's favorite, it happened that an English girl of twenty-one was pacing back and forth. Through the open curtained window she had seen her husband lead his command out through the echoing archway to the plain beyond; she had heard his boyish voice bark out the command and had listened to the rumble of the gun-wheels dying in the distance--for the last time possibly. She knew, as many an English girl has known, that she was alone, one white woman amid a swarm of sullen Aryans, and that she must follow along the road the guns had taken, served and protected by nothing more than low-caste natives.\n\nAnd yet she was dry-eyed, and her chin was high; for they are a strange breed, these Anglo-Saxon women who follow the men they love to the lonely danger-zone. Ruth Bellairs could have felt no joy in her position; she had heard her husband growling his complaint at being forced to leave her, and she guessed what her danger was. Fear must have shrunk her heartbeats and loneliness have tried her courage. But there was an ayah in the room with her, a low-caste woman of the conquered race; and pride of country came to her assistance. She was firm-lipped and, to outward seeming, brave as she was beautiful.\n\nEven when the door resounded twice to the sharp blow of a saber-hilt, and the ayah's pock-marked ebony took on a shade of gray, she stood like a queen with an army at her back and neither blanched nor trembled.\n\n\"Who is that, ayah?\" she demanded.\n\nThe ayah shrank into herself and showed the whites of her eyes and grinned, as a pariah dog might show its teeth--afraid, but scenting carrion.\n\n\"Go and see!\"\n\nThe ayah shuddered and collapsed, babbling incoherencies and calling on a horde of long-neglected gods to witness she was innocent. She clutched strangely at her breast and used only one hand to drag her shawl around her face. While she babbled she glanced wild-eyed around the long, low-ceilinged room. Ruth Bellairs looked down at her pityingly and went to the door herself and opened it.\n\n\"Salaam, memsahib!\" boomed a deep voice from the darkness.\n\nRuth Bellairs started and the ayah screamed.\n\n\"Who are you? Enter--let me see you!\"\n\nA black beard and a turban and the figure of a man--and then white teeth and a saber-hilt and eyes that gleamed moved forward from the darkness.\n\n\"It is I, Mahommed Khan!\" boomed the voice again, and the Risaldar stepped out into the lamplight and closed the door behind him. Then, with a courtly, long-discarded sweep of his right arm, he saluted.\n\n\"At the heavenborn's service!\"\n\n\"Mahommed Khan! Thank God!\"\n\nThe old man's shabbiness was very obvious as he faced her, with his back against the iron-studded door; but he stood erect as a man of thirty, and his medals and his sword-hilt and his silver scabbard-tip were bright.\n\n\"Tell me, Mahommed Khan, you have seen my husband?\"\n\nHe bowed.\n\n\"You have spoken to him?\"\n\nThe old man bowed again.\n\n\"He left you in my keeping, heavenborn. I am to bring you safe to Jundhra!\"\n\nShe held her hand out and he took it like a cavalier, bending until he could touch her fingers with his lips.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this hurrying of the guns to Jundhra, Risaldar?\"\n\n\"Who knows, memsahib! The orders of the Sirkar come, and we of the service must obey. I am thy servant and the Sirkar's!\"\n\n\"You, old friend--that were servant, as you choose to call it, to my husband's father! I am a proud woman to have such friends at call!\" She pointed to the ayah, recovering sulkily and rearranging the shawl about her shoulders. \"That I call service, Risaldar. She cowers when a knock comes at the door! I need you, and you answer a hardly spoken prayer; what is friendship, if yours is not?\"\n\nThe Risaldar bowed low again.\n\n\"I would speak with that ayah, heavenborn!\" he muttered, almost into his beard. She could hardly catch the words.\n\n\"I can't get her to speak to me at all tonight, Mahommed Khan. She's terrified almost out of her life at something. But perhaps you can do better. Try. Do you want to question her alone?\"\n\n\"By the heavenborn's favor, yes.\"\n\nRuth walked down the room toward the window, drew the curtain back and leaned her head out where whatever breeze there was might fan her cheek. The Risaldar strode over to where the ayah cowered by an inner doorway.\n\n\"She-Hindu-dog!\" he growled at her. \"Mother of whelps! Louse-ridden scavenger of sweepings! What part hast thou in all this treachery? Speak!\"\n\nThe ayah shrank away from him and tried to scream, but he gripped her by the throat and shook her.\n\n\"Speak!\" he growled again.\n\nBut his ten iron fingers held her in a vise-like grip and she could not have answered him if she had tried to.\n\n\"O Risaldar!\" called Ruth suddenly, with her head still out of the window. He released the ayah and let her tumble as she pleased into a heap.\n\n\"Heavenborn?\"\n\n\"What is that red glow on the skyline over yonder?\"\n\n\"A burning, heavenborn!\"\n\n\"A burning? What burning? Funeral pyres? It's very big for funeral pyres!\"\n\n\"Nay, heavenborn!\"\n\n\"What, then?\"\n\nShe was still unfrightened, unsuspicious of the untoward. The Risaldar's arrival on the scene had quite restored her confidence and she felt content to ride with him to Jundhra on the morrow.\n\n\"Barracks, heavenborn!\"\n\n\"Barracks? What barracks?\"\n\n\"There is but one barracks between here and Jundhra.\"\n\n\"Then--then--then--what has happened, Mahommed Khan?\"\n\n\"The worst has happened, heavenborn!\"\n\nHe stood between her and the ayah, so that she could not see the woman huddled on the floor.\n\n\"The worst? You mean then--my--my--husband--you don't mean that my husband--\"\n\n\"I mean, heavenborn that there is insurrection! All India is ablaze from end to end. These dogs here in Hanadra wait to rise because they think the section will return here in an hour or two; then they propose to burn it, men, guns and horses, like snakes in the summer grass. It is well that the section will not return! We will ride out safely before morning!\"\n\n\"And, my husband--he knew--all this--before he left me here?\"\n\n\"Nay! That he did not! Had I told him, he had disobeyed his orders and shamed his service; he is young yet, and a hothead! He will be far along the road to Jundhra before he knows what burns. And then he will remember that he trusts me and obey orders and press on!\"\n\n\"And you knew and did not tell him!\"\n\n\"Of a truth I knew!\"",
    "\"Sergeant!\"\n\n\"Sir!\"\n\nThe close-cropped, pipe-clayed non-commissioned officer spurred his horse into a canter until his scabbard clattered at young Bellairs' boot. Nothing but the rattling and the jolting of the guns and ammunition-wagon was audible, except just on ahead of them the click-clack, click-click-clack of the advance-guard. To the right and left of them the shadowy forms of giant banian-trees loomed and slid past them as they had done for the past four hours, and for ten paces ahead they could see the faintly outlined shape of the trunk road that they followed. The rest was silence and a pall of blackness obscuring everything. They had ridden along a valley, but they had emerged on rising ground and there was one spot of color in the pall now, or else a hole in it.\n\n\"What d'you suppose that is burning over there?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say, sir.\"\n\n\"How far away is it?\"\n\n\"Very hard to tell on a night like this, sir. It might be ten miles away and might be twenty. By my reckoning it's on our road, though, and somewhere between here and Jundhra.\"\n\n\"So it seems to me; our road swings round to the right presently, doesn't it? That'll lead us right to it. That would make it Doonha more or less. D'you suppose it's at Doonha?\"\n\n\"I was thinking it might be, sir. If it's Doonha, it means that the sepoy barracks and all the stores are burning--there's nothing else there that would make all that flame!\"\n\n\"There are two companies of the Thirty-third there, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but they're under canvas; tents would blaze up, but they'd die down again in a minute. That fire's steady and growing bigger!\"\n\n\"It's the sepoy barracks, then!\"\n\n\"Seems so to me, sir!\"\n\n\"Halt!\" roared Bellairs. The advance-guard kicked up a little shower of sparks, trace-chains slacked with a jingle and the jolting ceased. Bellairs rode up to the advance-guard.\n\n\"Now, Sergeant,\" he ordered, \"it looks as though that were the Doonha barracks burning over yonder. There's no knowing, though, what it is. Send four men on, two hundred yards ahead of you, and you and the rest keep a good two hundred yards ahead of the guns. See that the men keep on the alert, and mind that they spare their horses as much as possible. If there's going to be trouble, we may just as well be ready for it!\"\n\n\"Very good, sir!\"\n\n\"Go ahead, then!\"\n\nAt a word from the sergeant, four men clattered off and were swallowed in the darkness. A minute later the advance-guard followed them and then, after another minute's pause, young Bellairs' voice was raised into a ringing shout again.\n\n\"Section, advance! Trot, march!\"\n\nThe trace-chains tightened, and the clattering, bumping, jingling procession began again, its rear brought up by the six-horse ammunition-wagon. They rode speechless for the best part of an hour, each man's eyes on the distant conflagration that had begun now to light up the whole of the sky ahead of them. They still rode in darkness, but they seemed to be approaching the red rim of the Pit. Huge, billowing clouds of smoke, red-lit on the under side, belched upward to the blackness overhead, and a something that was scarcely sound--for it was yet too distant--warned them that it was no illusion they were riding into. The conflagration grew. It seemed to be nearly white-hot down below.\n\nBellairs wet his finger and held it extended upward.\n\n\"There's no wind that I can feel!\" he muttered. \"And yet, if that were a grass-fire, there'd be game and rats and birds and things--some of 'em would bolt this way. That's the Doonha barracks burning or I'm a black man, which the Lord forbid!\"\n\nA minute later, every man in the section pricked up his ears. There was no order given; but a sensation ran the whole length of it and a movement from easy riding to tense rigidity that could be felt by some sixth sense. Every man was listening, feeling, groping with his senses for something he could neither hear as yet nor see, but that he knew was there. And then, far-distant yet--not above, but under the jolting of the gun-wheels and the rattle of the scabbards--they could hear the clickety-clickety-clickety-click of a horse hard-ridden.\n\nThey had scarcely caught that sound, they had barely tightened up their bridle-reins, when another sound, one just as unmistakable, burst out in front of them. A ragged, ill-timed volley ripped out from somewhere near the conflagration and was answered instantly by one that was close-ripped like the fire of heavy ordnance. And then one of the advance-guard wheeled his horse and drove his spurs home rowel-deep. He came thundering back along the road with his scabbard out in the wind behind him and reined up suddenly when his horse's forefeet were abreast of the lieutenant.\n\n\"There's some one coming, sir, hard as he can gallop! He's one of our men by the sound of him. His horse is shod--and I thought I saw steel when the fire-light fell on him a minute ago!\"\n\n\"Are you sure there's only one?\"\n\n\"Sure, sir! You can hear him now!\"\n\n\"All right! Fall in behind me!\"\n\nBellairs felt his sword-hilt and cocked a pistol stealthily, but he gave no orders to the section. This might be a native soldier run amuck, and it might be a messenger; but in either case, friend or foe, if there was only one man he could deal with him alone.\n\n\"Halt!\" roared the advance-guard suddenly. But the horse's hoof-beats never checked for a single instant.\n\n\"Halt, you! Who comes there?\"\n\n\"Friend!\" came the answer, in an accent that was unmistakable.\n\n\"What friend? Where are you going?\"\n\nOne of the advance-guard reined his horse across the road. The others followed suit and blocked the way effectually. \"Halt!\" they roared in unison.\n\nThe main body of the advance came up with them.\n\n\"Who is he?\" shouted the sergeant.\n\n\"We'll soon see! Here he comes!\"\n\n\"Out of my way!\" yelled a voice, as a foamed-flecked horse burst out of the darkness like an apparition and bore straight down on them--his head bored a little to one side, the red rims of his nostrils wide distended and his whole sense and energy, and strength concentrated on pleasing the speed-hungry Irishman who rode him. He flashed into them head-on, like a devil from the outer darkness. His head touched a man's knee--and he rose and tried to jump him! His breast crashed full into the obstruction and horse and gunner crashed down to the road.",
    "The red glow of barracks burning--an ayah from whom a dagger has been taken locked in another room--the knowledge that there are fifty thousand Aryan brothers, itching to rebel, within a stone's throw--and two lone protectors of an alien race intent on torturing a High Priest, each and every one of these is a disturbing feature. No woman, and least of all a young woman such as Ruth Bellairs, can be blamed for being nervous under the stress of such conditions or for displaying a certain amount of feminine unreasonableness.\n\nShe stood shivering for a minute and watched spellbound while Mahommed Khan held the hot coal closer and even closer to the High Priest's naked foot. The priest writhed in anticipation of the agony and turned his eyes away, and as he turned them they met Ruth's. High priests of a religion that includes sooth-saying and prophecy and bribery of gods among its rites are students of human nature, and especially of female human nature. Knowledge of it and of how it may be gulled, and when, is the first essential of their calling. Her pale face, her blue eyes strained in terror, the parted lips and the attitude of tension, these gave him an idea. Before the charcoal touched him, he screamed--screamed like a wounded horse.\n\n\"Mahommed Khan, stop! Stop this instant! I won't have it! I won't have my life, even, on those terms! D'you hear me, sir!\"\n\n\"Have courage, heavenborn! There is but one way to force a Hindu priest, unless it be by cutting off his revenues--he must be hurt! This dog is unhurt as yet--see! The fire has not yet touched his foot!\"\n\n\"Don't let it, Mahommed Khan! Set that iron down! This is my room. I will not have crime committed here!\"\n\n\"And how long does the heavenborn think it would be her room were this evil-living pig of a priest at large, or how long before a worse crime were committed? Heavenborn, the hour is late and the charcoal dies out rapidly when it has left the fire! See. I must choose another piece!\"\n\nHe rummaged in the brazier, and she screamed again.\n\n\"I will not have it, Risaldar! You must find another way.\"\n\n\"Memsahib! Thy husband left thee in my care. Surely it is my right to choose the way?\"\n\n\"Leave me, then! I relieve you of your trust. I will not have him tortured in my room, or anywhere!\"\n\nMahommed Khan bowed low.\n\n\"Under favor, heavenborn,\" he answered, \"my trust is to your husband. I can be released by him, or by death, not otherwise.\"\n\n\"Once, and for all, Mahommed Khan, I will not have you torture him in here!\"\n\n\"Memsahib, I have yet to ride for succor! At daybreak, when these Hindus learn that the guns will not come back, they will rise to a man. Even now we must find a hiding-place or--it is not good even to think what I might find on my return!\"\n\nHe leaned over the priest again, but without the charcoal this time.\n\n\"Speak, thou!\" he ordered, growling in Hindustanee through his savage black mustache. \"I have yet to hear what price a Hindu sets on immunity from torture!\"\n\nBut the priest, it seemed, had formed a new idea. He had been looking through puckered eyes at Ruth, keen, cool calculation in his glance, and in spite of the discomfort of his strained position he contrived to nod.\n\n\"Kharvani!\" he muttered, half aloud.\n\n\"Aye! Call on Kharvani!\" sneered the Risaldar. \"Perhaps the Bride of Sivi will appear! Call louder!\"\n\nHe stirred again among the charcoal with his tongs, and Ruth and the High Priest both shuddered.\n\n\"Look!\" said the High Priest in Hindustanee, nodding in Ruth's direction. It was the first word that he had addressed to them. It took them by surprise, and the Risaldar and his half-brother turned and looked. Their breath left them.\n\nFramed in the yellow lamplight, her thin, hot-weather garments draped about her like a morning mist, Ruth stood and stared straight back at them through frightened eyes. Her blue-black hair, which had become loosened in her excitement, hung in a long plait over one shoulder and gleamed in the lamp's reflection. Her skin took on a faintly golden color from the feeble light, and her face seemed stamped with fear, anxiety, pity and suffering, all at once, that strangely enhanced her beauty, silhouetted as she was against the blackness of the wall behind, she seemed to be standing in an aura, shimmering with radiated light.\n\n\"Kharvani!\" said the High Priest to himself again, and the two Rajputs stood still like men dumfounded, and stared and stared and stared.\nThey knew Kharvani's temple. Who was there in Hanadra, Christian or Mohammedan or Hindu, who did not? The show-building of the city, the ancient, gloomy, wonderful erection where bats lived in the dome and flitted round Kharvani's image, the place where every one must go who needed favors of the priests, the central hub of treason and intrigue, where every plot was hatched and every rumor had its origin--the ultimate, mazy, greedy, undisgorging goal of every bribe and every blackmail-wrung rupee!\n\nThey knew, too, as every one must know who has ever been inside the place, the amazing, awe-inspiring picture of Kharvani painted on the inner wall; of Kharvani as she was idealized in the days when priests believed in her and artists thought the labor of a lifetime well employed in painting but one picture of her--Kharvani the sorrowful, grieving for the wickedness of earth; Kharvani, Bride of Siva, ready to intercede with Siva, the Destroyer, for the helpless, foolish, purblind sons of man.\n\nAnd here, before them, stood Kharvani--to the life!\n\n\"What of Kharvani?\" growled Mahommed Khan.\n\n\"'A purblind fool, a sot and a Mohammedan,\"' quoted the priest maliciously, \"'how many be they, three or one?'\"\n\nThe Risaldar's hand went to his scabbard. His sword licked out free and trembled like a tuning-fork. He flicked with his thumbnail at the blade and muttered: \"Sharp! Sharp as death itself!\"\n\nThe Hindu grinned, but the blade came down slowly until the point of it rested on the bridge of his nose. His eyes squinted inward, watching it.\n\n\"Now, make thy gentle joke again!\" growled the Risaldar. Ruth Bellairs checked a scream.\n\n\"No blood!\" she exclaimed. \"Don't hurt him, Risaldar! I'll not have you kill a man in here--or anywhere, in cold blood, for that matter! Return your sword, sir!\"\n\nThe Risaldar swore into his beard. The High Priest grinned again. \"I am not afraid to die!\" he sneered. \"Thrust with that toy of thine! Thrust home and make an end!\"",
    "She had recovered far enough to climb the ladder and the steep stone stair above it, and Suliman climbed up behind her, grumbling dreadful prophecies of what would happen to the priests now that Mohammed Khan had come.\n\"Is all well, Risaldar?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Nay, heavenborn! All is not well yet! The general sahib from Jundhra and your husband's guns and others, making one division, are engaged with rebels eight or nine miles from here. We saw part of the battle as we rode!\"\n\n\"Who wins?\"\n\n\"It is doubtful, heavenborn! How could we tell from this distance?\"\n\n\"Have you a horse for me?\"\n\n\"Ay, heavenborn! Here! Bring up that horse, thou, and Suliman's! Ride him cross-saddle, heavenborn--there were no side-saddles in Siroeh! Nay, he is just a little frightened. He will stand--he will not throw thee! I did better than I thought, heavenborn. I come with four-and-twenty, making twenty-six with me and Suliman. An escort for a queen! So--sit him quietly. Leave the reins free. Suliman will lead him! Ho! Fronnnt! Rank--'bout-face!\"\n\n\"My son!\" wailed the High Priest. \"Where is my son?\"\n\n\"Tell him, Suliman!\"\n\n\"Where I caught thee, thou idol-briber!\" snarled the Risaldar's half-brother.\n\n\"Where? In that den of stinks. Gagged and bound all this while?\"\n\n\"Ha! Gagged and bound and out of mischief where all priests and priests' sons ought to be!\" laughed Mahommed Khan. \"Farward! Farm twos Ter-r-r-ott!\"\n\nIn went the spur, and the snorting, rattling, clanking cavalcade sidled and pranced out of the temple into the sunshine, with Ruth and Suliman in the midst of them.\n\n\"Gallop!\" roared the Risaldar, the moment that the last horse was clear of the temple-doors. And in that instant he saw what the High Priest's whispering had meant.\n\nComing up the street toward them was a horde of silent, hurrying Hindus, armed with swords and spears, wearing all of them the caste-marks of the Brahman--well-fed, indignant relations of the priests, intent on avenging the defilement of Kharvani's temple.\n\n\"Canter! Fronnnt--farm--Gallop! Charge!\"\n\nRuth found herself in the midst of a whirlwind of flashing sabers, astride of a lean-flanked Katiawari gelding that could streak like an antelope, knee to knee with a pair of bearded Rajputs, one of whom gripped her bridle-rein--thundering down a city street straight for a hundred swords that blocked her path. She set her eyes on the middle of Mahommed Khan's straight back, gripped the saddle with both hands, set her teeth and waited for the shock. Mahommed Khan's right arm rose and his sword flashed in the sunlight as he stood up in his stirrups. She shut her eyes. But there was no shock! There was the swish of whirling steel, the thunder of hoofs, the sound of bodies falling. There was a scream or two as well and a coarse-mouthed Rajput oath. But when she dared to open her eyes once more they were thundering still, headlong down the city street and Mahommed Khan was whirling his sword in mid-air to shake the blood from it.\n\n\nAhead lay the city gate and she could see another swarm of Hindus rushing from either side to close it. But \"Charge!\" yelled Mahommed Khan again, and they swept through the crowd, through the half-shut gate, out on the plain beyond, as a wind sweeps through the forest, leaving fallen tree-trunks in its wake.\n\n\"Halt!\" roared the Risaldar, when they were safely out of range. \"Are any hurt? No? Good for us that their rifles are all in the firing-line yonder!\"\n\nHe sat for a minute peering underneath his hand at the distant, dark, serried mass of men and the steel-tipped lines beyond it, watching the belching cannon and the spurting flames of the close-range rifle-fire.\n\n\"See, heavenborn!\" he said, pointing. \"Those will be your husband's guns! See, over on the left, there. See! They fire! Those two! We can reach them if we make a circuit on the flank here!\"\n\n\"But can we get through, Risaldar? Won't they see us and cut us off?\"\n\n\"Heavenborn!\" he answered, \"men who dare ride into a city temple and snatch thee from the arms of priests dare and can do anything! Take this, heavenborn--take it as a keepsake, in case aught happens!\"\n\nHe drew off the priest's ring, gave it to her and then, before she could reply:\n\n\"Canter!\" he roared. The horses sprang forward in answer to the spurs and there was nothing for Ruth to do but watch the distant battle and listen to the deep breathing of the Rajputs on either hand.",
    "There could be no retreat that day and no thought of it. Jundhra and Doonha were in ruins. The bridges were down behind them and Hanadra lay ahead. The British had to win their way into it or perish. Tired out, breakfastless, suffering from the baking heat, the long, thin British line had got--not to hold at bay but to smash and pierce--an over-whelming force of Hindus that was stiffened up and down its length by small detachments of native soldiers who had mutinied.\n\nNumbers were against them, and even superiority of weapons was not so overwhelmingly in their favor, for those were the days of short-range rifle-fire and smoothbore artillery, and one gun was considerably like another. The mutinous sepoys had their rifles with them; there were guns from the ramparts of Hanadra that were capable of quite efficient service at close range; and practically every man in the dense-packed rebel line had a firearm of some kind. It was only in cavalry and discipline and pluck that the British force had the advantage, and the cavalry had already charged once and had been repulsed.\n\nGeneral Turner rode up and down the sweltering firing-line, encouraging the men when it seemed to him they needed it and giving directions to his officers. He was hidden from view oftener than not by the rolling clouds of smoke and he popped up here and there suddenly and unexpectedly. Wherever he appeared there was an immediate stiffening among the ranks, as though he carried a supply of spare enthusiasm with him and could hand it out.\n\nColonel Carter, commanding the right wing, turned his head for a second at the sound of a horse's feet and found the general beside him.\n\n\"Had I better have my wounded laid in a wagon, sir?\" he suggested, \"in case you find it necessary to fall back?\"\n\n\"There will be no retreat!\" said General Turner. \"Leave your wounded where they are. I never saw a cannon bleed before. How's that?\"\n\nHe spurred his horse over to where one of Bellairs' guns was being run forward into place again and Colonel Carter followed him. There was blood dripping from the muzzle of it.\n\n\"We're short of water, sir!\" said Colonel Carter.\n\nAnd as he spoke a gunner dipped his sponge into a pool of blood and rammed it home.\n\nBellairs was standing between his two guns, looking like the shadow of himself, worn out with lack of sleep, disheveled, wounded. There was blood dripping from his forehead and he wore his left arm in a sling made from his shirt.\n\n\"Fire!\" he ordered, and the two guns barked in unison and jumped back two yards or more.\n\n\"If you'll look,\" said General Turner, plucking at the colonel's sleeve, \"you'll see a handful of native cavalry over yonder behind the enemy--rather to the enemy's left--there between those two clouds of smoke. D'you see them?\"\n\n\"They look like Sikhs or Rajputs,\" said the colonel.\n\n\"Yes. Don't they? I'd like you to keep an eye on them. They've come up from the rear. I caught sight of them quite a while ago and I can't quite make them out. It's strange, but I can't believe that they belong to the enemy. D'you see?--there--they've changed direction. They're riding as though they intended to come round the enemy's left flank!\"\n\n\"By gad, they are! Look! The enemy are moving to cut them off!\"\n\n\"I must get back to the other wing!\" said General Turner. \"But that looks like the making of an opportunity! Keep both eyes lifting, Carter, and advance the moment you see any confusion in the enemy's ranks.\"\n\nHe rode off, and Colonel Carter stared long and steadily at the approaching horsemen. He saw a dense mass of the enemy, about a thousand strong, detach itself from the left wing and move to intercept them, and he noticed that the movement made a tremendous difference to the ranks opposed to him. He stepped up to young Bellairs and touched his sleeve. Bellairs started like a man roused from a dream.\n\n\"That's your wife over there!\" said Colonel Carter. \"There can't be any other white woman here-abouts riding with a Rajput escort!\"\n\nBellairs gripped the colonel's outstretched arm.\n\n\"Where?\" he almost screamed. \"Where? I don't see her!\"\n\n\"There, man! There, where that mass of men is moving! Look! By the Lord Harry! He's charging right through the mob! That's Mahommed Khan, I'll bet a fortune! Now's our chance Bugler!\"\n\n\nThe bugler ran to him, and he began to puff into his instrument.\n\n\"Blow the 'attention' first!\"\n\nOut rang the clear, strident notes, and the non-commissioned officers and men took notice that a movement of some kind would shortly be required of them, but the din of firing never ceased for a single instant. Then, suddenly, an answering bugle sang out from the other flank.\n\n\"Advance in echelon!\" commanded Colonel Carter, and the bugler did his best to split his cheeks in a battle-rending blast.\n\n\"You remain where you are, sir!\" he ordered young Bellairs. \"Keep your guns served to the utmost!\"\n\nSix-and-twenty horsemen, riding full-tilt at a thousand men, may look like a trifle, but they are disconcerting. What they hit, they kill; and if they succeed in striking home, they play old Harry with formations. And Risaldar Mahommed Khan did strike home. He changed direction suddenly and, instead of using up his horses' strength in outflanking the enemy, who had marched to intercept him, and making a running target of his small command, he did the unexpected--which is the one best thing to do in war. He led his six-and-twenty at a headlong gallop straight for the middle of the crowd--it could not be called by any military name. They fired one ragged volley at him and then had no time to load before he was in the middle of them, clashing right and left and pressing forward. They gave way, right and left, before him, and a good number of them ran. Half a hundred of them were cut down as they fled toward their firing-line. At that second, just as the Risaldar and his handful burst through the mob and the mob began rushing wildly out of his way, the British bugles blared out the command to advance in echelon.\n\n\nThe Indians were caught between a fire and a charge that they had good reason to fear in front of them, and a disturbance on their left flank that might mean anything. As one-half of them turned wildly to face what might be coming from this unexpected quarter, the British troops came on with a roar, and at the same moment Mahommed Khan reached the rear of their firing-line and crashed headlong into it.",
    "Lying lazily at anchor off the reeking beach of Adra Bight, the Puncher looked peaceful and complacent--which is altogether opposite to what she and her commander were, or had been, for a month. The ship hummed her shut-in discontent, as a hive does when the bees propose to swarm, and her commander--who never, be it noted, went to windward of the one word \"damn\"--used that one word very frequently.\n\nHe sat \"abaft the mainmast\" at a table that was splotched already with abundant perspiration, and the acting engineer who stood in front of him shifted from foot to foot in attitudes expressive of increasing agony of mind. It grew obvious at last that there was a limit to Mr. Hartley's store of courteous deference.\n\nThere had been news, red hot but wrong, of dhows loaded to the water-line with guns and ammunition somewhere up the Gulf. India, ever fretful for her tribes beyond the border, had borrowed Applewaite and his destroyer by instant cablegram, and jealously held records had been broken while the Puncher quartered those indecent seas and heated up her bearings. It was almost too much to have to come back empty-handed. It was quite too much to have to run for shelter under the lee of Adra's uninviting coral reef. And to be told by an acting engineer that he would have to stay a week was utterly beyond the scope of polite conversation.\n\n\"Why a week?\" asked Commander Applewaite, with eyebrows raised to the nth power of incredulity.\n\n\"Why a week?\" asked Mr. Hartley, breaking down the barrier of self-restraint at last. \"I'll tell you why. Because, although the guts of her are so much scrap-iron, you've a crew of engineers who could build machinery of hell-slag--build it, mind--and could get steam out o' the Sahara, where there isn't any water at all. Because--conditional upon the act o' God and your permission--I'm willing to perform a miracle. Because the whole engine-room complement is dancing mad for shore leave, and there'll be none this side o' Bombay; and because, in consequence o' that, creation would be a mild name for what's about to happen under gratings until the shafts revolve again. Man, I wish ye'd take one peep at her bearings, though ye wouldn't understand. Because you're lucky; any other engineer in all the navies o' the world would take a month to tinker with her, even if he didn't have to send to Bombay for a tow. Because--\"\n\n\"That'll do!\" said Applewaite, his mind wandering already in search of suitable employment for the crew. \"Get the repairs done as soon as possible; we stay here until you have finished what is necessary.\"\n\nIt looked like an evil moment for asking favors, but it was the time laid down in Regulations when such things as favors may be had; and it was the moment Curley Crothers had picked out for asking for shore leave.\n\n\"Come 'ere, Scamp. Come along, Scamp. Come along 'ere--good boy!\" he coaxed, dragging by a short chain in his wake the sorriest-looking bull terrier that ever acted mascot in the British or any other navy.\nCourteous and huge and cap in hand, his weather-beaten face smiling respectfully above a snow-white uniform, he took his stand before the little table. His outward bearing was one of certainty, but his shrewd, slightly puckered eyes alternately conned the expression of his commander's face and watched the dog.\n\nThe lee scuppers were the goal of the dog's immediate ambition, for he was a well-brought-up dog and such of the decencies as were not his by instinct he had learned by painful and repeated acquisition. But at the moment Curley Crothers showed a wondrous disregard for etiquette.\n\n\"He's very sick, sir,\" he asserted, tugging a little at the chain in the hope of producing instant proof of his contention. But the dog was gamiest of the game, and swallowed hurriedly.\n\n\"Well? I'm not a vet. What about it?\"\n\n\"The whole ship's crew 'ud be sorry, sir, if 'e was to lose 'is number. He's the best mascot this ship ever had, by all accounts.\"\n\n\"He hasn't brought us much luck this run!\" smiled Applewaite, remembering a long list of \"previous convictions\" and wondering what Crothers might be up to next.\n\n\"No, sir? We're still a-top o' the water, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh! He gets the credit for that, eh? But for him, I suppose we'd have piled up on the reef yesterday?\"\n\n\"Saving your presence, sir.\"\n\nCurley Crothers made a gesture expressive of a world of compliment and praise, but he kept one eye steadily on the dog; he seemed to imply that but for the presence of the dog on board the commander might have forgotten his seamanship.\n\n\"Well? What do you suggest?\"\n\n\"Seeing the poor dog's sick, sir, and you and all of us so fond of him, and all he needs is exercise, I thought perhaps as 'ow you'd order me an' Byng, sir, to take 'im for a run ashore. There'd be jackals and pi-dogs for 'im to chase. A bit o' sport 'ud set 'im up in a jiffy. He's languishing--that's what's the matter with him.\"\n\nThere were almost tears in his voice as he tugged at the chain surreptitiously, in a vain effort to produce the cataclysm that was overdue. But for all his efforts to appear affected, his eyes were smiling. So were his commander's.\n\n\"Why Byng?\" he asked.\n\n\"Byng cleans him, sir. He knows Byng.\"\n\n\"Then, why you?\"\n\n\"Why; he knows me too, sir, and between the two of us, we'd manage him proper. S'posin' he was to get huntin' on his own and one of us was tired out chasin' him, t'other could run and catch him. If there was only one of us, he couldn't.\"\n\n\"I see. But supposing exercise isn't what he wants after all? Suppose he needs a long rest and lots of sleep? How about that?\"\n\nThe argument had reached a crisis, and Curley realized it. Joking or not, when the commander of a ship takes too long in reaching a decision he generally does not reach a favorable one. The leash was tugged again, this time with some severity. The martyred Scamp was drawn on his protesting haunches close to the official table, that the commander might have a better view of his distress. And then the expected happened--voluminously.\n\nCurley stood with an expression of wooden-headed, abject innocence on his big, broad face, and looked straight in front of him.\n\n\"He certainly is sick, sir,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Sick. Good heavens! The dog's turning himself inside out! That's the last time a thing like this happens; he's the last dog I ever take on a cruise. Take him away at once! Bosun--call some one to wipe up that disgusting mess!\"\n\n\"Take him ashore, did you say, sir?\"\n\n\"Take him out of this! Take him anywhere you like! Yes, take him ashore and lose him--feed him to the sharks--give him to the Arabs--take him away, that's all!\"\n\n\"Me and Byng, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, you and Byng! Did you hear me tell you to take him away?\"\n\n\"Very good, sir; thank you!\""

  "Talbot Mundy -- Hira Singh : when India came to fight in Flanders": [
    "A Sikh who must have stood about six feet without his turban--and only imagination knows how stately he was with it--loomed out of the violet mist of an Indian morning and scrutinized me with calm brown eyes. His khaki uniform, like two of the medal ribbons on his breast, was new, but nothing else about him suggested rawness. Attitude, grayness, dignity, the unstudied strength of his politeness, all sang aloud of battles won. Battles with himself they may have been--but they were won.\n\nI began remembering ice-polished rocks that the glaciers once dropped along Maine valleys, when his quiet voice summoned me back to India and the convalescent camp beyond whose outer gate I stood. Two flags on lances formed the gate and the boundary line was mostly imaginary; but one did not trespass, because at about the point where vision no longer pierced the mist there stood a sentry, and the grounding of a butt on gravel and now and then a cough announced others beyond him again.\n\n\"I have permission,\" I said, \"to find a certain Risaldar-major Ranjoor Singh, and to ask him questions.\"\n\nHe smiled. His eyes, betraying nothing but politeness, read the very depths of mine.\n\n\"Has the sahib credentials?\" he asked. So I showed him the permit covered with signatures that was the one scrap of writing left in my possession after several searchings.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said gravely. \"There were others who had no permits. Will you walk with me through the camp?\"\n\nThat was new annoyance, for with such a search as I had in mind what interest could there be in a camp for convalescent Sikhs? Tents pitched at intervals--a hospital marquee--a row of trees under which some of the wounded might sit and dream the day through-these were all things one could imagine without journeying to India. But there was nothing to do but accept, and I walked beside him, wishing I could stride with half his grace.\n\n\"There are no well men here,\" he told me. \"Even the heavy work about the camp is done by convalescents.\"\n\n\"Then why are you here?\" I asked, not trying to conceal admiration for his strength and stature.\n\n\"I, too, am not yet quite recovered.\"\n\n\"From what?\" I asked, impudent because I felt desperate. But I drew no fire.\n\n\"I do not know the English name for my complaint,\" he said. (But he spoke English better than I, he having mastered it, whereas I was only born to its careless use.)\n\n\"How long do you expect to remain on the sick list?\" I asked, because a woman once told me that the way to make a man talk is to seem to be interested in himself.\n\n\"Who knows?\" said he.\n\nHe showed me about the camp, and we came to a stand at last under the branches of an enormous mango tree. Early though it was, a Sikh non-commissioned officer was already sitting propped against the trunk with his bandaged feet stretched out in front of him--a peculiar attitude for a Sikh.\n\n\"That one knows English,\" my guide said, nodding. And making me a most profound salaam, he added: \"Why not talk with him? I have duties. I must go.\"\n\nThe officer turned away, and I paid him the courtesy due from one man to another. It shall always be a satisfying memory that I raised my hat to him and that he saluted me.\n\n\"What is that officer's name?\" I asked, and the man on the ground seemed astonished that I did not know.\n\n\"Risaldar-major Ranjoor Singh bahadur!\" he said.\n\nFor a second I was possessed by the notion of running after him, until I recalled that he had known my purpose from the first and that therefore his purpose must have been deliberate. Obviously, I would better pursue the opportunity that in his own way He had given me.\n\n\"What is your name?\" I asked the man on the ground.\n\n\"Hira Singh,\" he answered, and at that I sat down beside him. For I had also heard of Hira Singh.\n\nHe made quite a fuss at first because, he said, the dusty earth beneath a tree was no place for a sahib. But suddenly he jumped to the conclusion I must be American, and ceased at once to be troubled about my dignity. On the other hand, he grew perceptibly less distant. Not more friendly, perhaps, but less guarded.\n\n\"You have talked with Sikhs in California?\" he asked, and I nodded.\n\n\"Then you have heard lies, sahib. I know the burden of their song. A bad Sikh and a bad Englishman alike resemble rock torn loose. The greater the height from which they fall, the deeper they dive into the mud. Which is the true Sikh, he who marched with us or he who abuses us? Yet I am told that in America men believe what hired Sikhs write for the German papers. No man hired me, sahib, although one or two have tried. When I came of age I sought acceptance in the army, and was chosen among many. When my feet are healed I shall return to duty. I am a true Sikh. If the sahib cares to listen, I will tell him truth that has not been written in the papers.\"\n\nSo, having diagnosed my nationality and need, he proceeded to tell me patiently things that many English are in the dark about, both because of the censorship and because of the prevailing superstition that the English resent being told--he stabbing and sweeping at the dust with a broken twig and making little heaps and dents by way of illustration,--I sitting silent, brushing away the flies. Day after day I sought him soon after dawn when they were rolling up the tent-flaps. I shared the curry and chapatties that a trooper brought to him at noon, and I fetched water for him to drink from time to time. It was dusk each day before I left him, so that, what with his patience and my diligence, I have been able to set down the story as he told it, nearly in his own words.\n\nBut of Risaldar-major Ranjoor Singh bahadur in the flesh, I have not had another glimpse. I went in search of him the very first evening, only to learn that he had \"passed his medical\" that afternoon and had returned at once to active service.",
    "Perhaps the sahib has watched Sikh cavalry at night and wondered how so many men and horses could keep so still. We had made but little noise hitherto, but now our silence was that of night itself. We had but one eye, one ear, one intellect among us. We were one! One with the night and with the work ahead!\n\nOne red light swinging near the corner of the forest was to mean BE READY! We were ready as the fuse is for the match! Two red lights would mean that the sidewise movement by the infantry was under way. Three lights swinging together were to be our signal to begin. Sahib, I saw three red lights three thousand times between each minute and the next!\n\nThe shell-fire increased from both sides. Where the British infantry lay was such a lake of flame and din that the very earth seemed to burst apart; yet the answering rifle-fire was steady--steady as the roll of drums. Then we truly saw one red light, and \"EK!\" said we all at once. EK means ONE, sahib, but it sounded like the opening of a breech-block. \"Mount!\" ordered Colonel Kirby, and we mounted.\n\nWhile I held my breath and watched for the second light I heard a new noise behind me, different from the rest, and therefore audible--a galloping horse and a challenge close at hand. I saw in the light of a bursting shell a Sikh officer, close followed by a trooper on a blown horse. I saw the officer ride to Colonel Kirby's side, rein in his charger, and salute. At that instant there swung two red lights, and \"DO!\" said the regiment. DO means TWO, sahib, but it sounded like the thump of ordnance. \"Draw sabers!\" commanded Colonel Kirby, and the rear ranks drew. The front-rank men had lances.\n\nBy the light of a star-shell I could plainly see the Sikh officer and trooper. I recognized the charger--a beast with the devil in him and the speed of wind. I recognized both men. I thought a shell must have struck me. I must be dead and in a new world. I let my horse edge nearer, not believing--until ears confirmed eyes. I heard Colonel Kirby speak, very loud, indeed, as a man to whom good news comes.\n\n\"Ranjoor Singh!\" said he; and he took him by the hand and wrung it. \"Thank God!\" he said, speaking from the heart as the British do at times when they forget that others listen. \"Thank God, old man! You've come in the nick of time!\"\n\nSo I was right, and my heart leapt in me. He was with us before the blood ran! Every man in the squadron recognized him now, and I knew every eye had watched to see Colonel Kirby draw saber and cut him down, for habit of thought is harder to bend than a steel bar. But I could feel the squadron coming round to my way of thinking as Colonel Kirby continued talking to him, obviously making him an explanation of our plan.\n\n\"Join your squadron, man--hurry!\" I heard Colonel Kirby say at last, for taking advantage of the darkness I had let my horse draw very near to them. Now I had to rein back and make pretense that my horse had been unruly, for Ranjoor Singh came riding toward us, showing his teeth in a great grin, and Captain Fellowes with a word of reproof thrown back to me spurred on to meet him.\n\n\"Hurrah, Major Ranjoor Singh!\" said Captain Fellowes. \"I'm damned glad to see you!\" That was a generous speech, sahib, from a man who must now yield command of the squadron, but Captain Fellowes had a heart like a bridegroom's always. He must always glory in the squadron's luck, and he loved us better than himself. That was why we loved him. They shook hands, and looked in each other's eyes. Ranjoor Singh wheeled his charger. And in that same second we all together saw three red lights swinging by the corner.\n\n\"TIN!\" said we, with one voice. Tin means three, sahib, but it sounded rather like the scream of a shell that leaves on its journey.\n\nMy horse laid his ears back and dug his toes into the ground. A trumpet sounded, and Colonel Kirby rose in his stirrups:\n\n\"Outram's Own!\" he yelled, \"by squadrons on number One--\"\n\nBut the sahib would not be interested in the sequence of commands that have small meaning to those not familiar with them. And who shall describe what followed? Who shall tell the story of a charge into the night, at an angle, into massed regiments of infantry advancing one behind another at the double and taken by surprise?\n\nThe guns of both sides suddenly ceased firing. Even as I used my spurs they ceased. How? Who am I that I should know? The British guns, I suppose, from fear of slaying us, and the German guns from fear of slaying Germans; but as to how, I know not. But the German star-shells continued bursting overhead, and by that weird light their oncoming infantry saw charging into them men they had never seen before out of a picture-book!\n\nGod knows what tales they had been told about us Sikhs. I read their faces as I rode. Fear is an ugly weapon, sahib, whose hilt is more dangerous than its blade. If our officers had told us such tales about Germans as their officers had told them about us, I think perhaps we might have feared to charge.\n\nNumbers were as nothing that night. Speed, and shock, and unexpectedness were ours, and lies had prepared us our reception. D Squadron rode behind Ranjoor Singh like a storm in the night--swung into line beside the other squadrons--and spurred forward as in a dream. There was no shouting; no war-cry. We rode into the Germans as I have seen wind cut into a forest in the hills--downward into them, for once we had leapt the trench the ground sloped their way. And they went down before us as we never had the chance of mowing them again.",
    "The day passed and there came another day, when the bread was done, and there were no more German wounded straddled in the mud over whom to strike new bargains. It had ceased raining, so we could catch no rain to drink. We were growing weak from weariness and want of sleep, and we demanded of Ranjoor Singh that he lead us back toward the British lines.\n\n\"We should perish on the way,\" said he.\n\n\"What of it?\" we answered, I with the rest. \"Better that than this vulture's death in a graveyard!\"\n\nBut he shook his head and ordered us to try to think like men. \"The life of a Sikh,\" said he, \"and the oath of a Sikh are one. We swore to serve our friends. To try to cut our way back would be but to die for our own comfort.\"\n\n\"You should have led us back that first night, when the attack was spent,\" said Gooja Singh.\n\n\"I was not in command that first night,\" Ranjoor Singh answered him, and who could gainsay that?\n\nAt irregular intervals British shells began bursting near us, and we all knew what they were. The batteries were feeling for the range. They would begin a new bombardment. Now, therefore, is the end, said we. But Ranjoor Singh stood up with his head above the trench and began shouting to the Germans. They answered him. Then, to our utter astonishment, he tore the shirt from a dead man, tied it to a rifle, and held it up.\n\nThe Germans cheered and laughed, but we made never a sound. We were bewildered--sick from the stink and weariness and thirst and lack of food. Yet I swear to you, sahib, on my honor that it had not entered into the heart of one of us to surrender. That we who had been first of the Indian contingent to board a ship, first to land in France, first to engage the enemy, should now be first to surrender in a body seemed to us very much worse than death. Yet Ranjoor Singh bade us leave our rifles and climb out of the trench, and we obeyed him. God knows why we obeyed him. I, who had been half-hearted hitherto, hated him in that minute as a trapped wolf hates the hunter; yet I, too, obeyed.\n\nWe left our dead for the Germans to bury, but we dragged the wounded out and some of them died as we lifted them. When we reached the German trench and they counted us, including Ranjoor Singh and three-and-forty wounded there were two-hundred-and-three-and-fifty of us left alive.\n\nThey led Ranjoor Singh apart. He had neither rifle nor saber in his hand, and he walked to their trench alone because we avoided him. He was more muddy than we, and as ragged and tired. He had stood in the same foul water, and smelt the same stench. He was hungry as we. He had been willing to surrender, and we had not. Yet he walked like an officer, and looked like one, and we looked like animals. And we knew it, and he knew it. And the Germans recognized the facts.\n\nHe acted like a crowned king when he reached the trench. A German officer spoke with him earnestly, but he shook his head and then they led him away. When he was gone the same officer came and spoke to us in English, and I understanding him at once, he bade me tell the others that the British must have witnessed our surrender. \"See,\" said he, \"what a bombardment they have begun again. That is in the hope of slaying you. That is out of revenge because you dared surrender instead of dying like rats in a ditch to feed their pride!\" It was true that a bombardment had begun again. It had begun that minute. Those truly had been ranging shells. If we had stayed five minutes longer before surrendering we should have been blown to pieces; but we were in no mood to care on that account.\n\nThe Germans are a simple folk, sahib, although they themselves think otherwise. When they think they are the subtlest they are easiest to understand. Understanding was reborn in my heart on account of that German's words. Thought I, if Ranjoor Singh were in truth a traitor then he would have leaped at a chance to justify himself to us. He would have repeated what that German had urged him to tell us. Yet I saw him refuse.\n\nAs they hurried him away alone, pity for him came over me like warm rain on the parched earth, and when a man can pity he can reason, I spoke in Punjabi to the others and the German officer thought I was translating what he told me to say, yet in truth I reminded them that man can find no place where God is not, and where God is is courage. I was senior now, and my business was to encourage them. They took new heart from my words, all except Gooja Singh, who wept noisily, and the German officer was pleased with what he mistook for the effect of his speech.\n\n\"Tell them they shall be excellently treated,\" said he, seizing my elbow. \"When we shall have won this war the British will no longer be able to force natives of India to fight their battles for them.\"\n\nI judged it well to repeat that word for word. There are over ten applicants for every vacancy in such a regiment as ours, and until Ranjoor Singh ordered our surrender, we were all free men--free givers of our best; whereas the Germans about us were all conscripts. The comparison did no harm.",
    "\"Yet in that case,\" said I, \"we should not be traitors.\"\n\n\"I will tell you a story,\" said he, and we held our breath to listen, for this was his old manner. This had ever been his way of putting recruits at ease and of making a squadron understand. In that minute, for more than a minute, men forgot they had ever suspected him.\n\n\"When I was a little one,\" said he, \"my mother's aunt, who was an old hag, told me this tale. There was a pack of wolves that hunted in a forest near a village. In the village lived a man who wished to be headman. Abdul was his name, and he had six sons. He wished to be headman that he might levy toll among the villagers for the up-keep of his sons, who were hungry and very proud. Now Abdul was a cunning hunter, and his sons were strong. So he took thought, and chose a season carefully, and set his sons to dig a great trap. And so well had Abdul chosen--so craftily the six sons digged--that one night they caught all that wolf-pack in the trap. And they kept them in the trap two days and a night, that they might hunger and thirst and grow amenable.\n\nThen Abdul leaned above the pit, and peered down at the wolves and began to bargain with them. 'Wolves,' said he, 'your fangs be long and your jaws be strong, and I wish to be headman of this village.' And they answered, 'Speak, Abdul, for these walls be high, and our throats be dry, and we wish to hunt again!' So he bade them promise that if he let them go they would seek and slay the present headman and his sons, so that he might be headman in his place. And the wolves promised. Then when he had made them swear by a hundred oaths in a hundred different ways, and had bound them to keep faith by God and by earth and sky and sea and by all the holy things he could remember, he stood aside and bade his six sons free the wolves.\n\nThe sons obeyed, and helped the wolves out of the trap. And instantly the wolves fell on all six sons, and slew and devoured them. Then they came and stood round Abdul with their jaws dripping with blood.\n\n\"'Oh, wolves,' said he, trembling with fear and anger, 'ye are traitors! Ye are forsworn! Ye are faithless ones!'\n\n\"But they answered him, 'Oh, Abdul, shall he who knows not false from true judge treason?' and forthwith they slew him and devoured him, and went about their business.\n\n\"Now, which had the right of that--Abdul or the wolves?\"\n\n\"We are no wolves!\" said Gooja Singh in a whining voice. \"We be true men!\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you another story,\" Ranjoor Singh answered him. And we listened again, as men listen to the ticking of a clock. \"This is a story the same old woman, my mother's aunt, told me when I was very little.\n\nThere was a man--and this man's name also was Abdul--who owned a garden, and in it a fish-pond. But in the fish-pond were no fish. Abdul craved fish to swim hither and thither in his pond, but though he tried times out of number he could catch none. Yet at fowling he had better fortune, and when he was weary one day of fishing and laid his net on land he caught a dozen birds.\n\n\"'So-ho!' said Abdul, being a man much given to thought, and he went about to strike a bargain. 'Oh, birds,' said he, 'are ye willing to be fish? For I have no fishes swimming in my pond, yet my heart desires them greatly. So if ye are willing to be fish and will stay in my good pond and swim there, gladdening my eyes, I will abstain from killing you but instead will set you in the pond and let you live.'\n\n\"So the birds, who were very terrified, declared themselves willing to be fish, and the birds swore even more oaths than he insisted on, so that he was greatly pleased and very confident. Therefore he used not very much precaution when he came to plunge the birds into the water, and the instant he let go of them the birds with feathers scarcely wet flew away and perched on the trees about him.\n\n\"Then Abdul grew very furious. 'Oh, birds,' said he, 'ye are traitors. Ye are forsworn! Ye are liars--breakers of oaths--deceitful ones!' And he shook his fist at them and spat, being greatly enraged and grieved at their deception.\n\n\"But the birds answered him, 'Oh, Abdul, a captive's gyves and a captive's oath are one, and he who rivets on the one must keep the other!' And the birds flew away, but Abdul went to seek his advocate to have the law of them! Now, what think ye was the advocate's opinion in the matter, and what remedy had Abdul?\"\n\nHas the sahib ever seen three hundred men all at the same time becoming conscious of the same idea? That is quite a spectacle. There was no whispering, nor any movement except a little shifting of the feet. There was nothing on which a watchful man could lay a finger. Yet between one second and the next they were not the same men, and I, who watched Ranjoor Singh's eyes as if he were my opponent in a duel, saw that he was aware of what had happened, although not surprised. But he made no sign except the shadow of one that I detected, and he did not change his voice--as yet.\n\n\"As for me,\" he said, telling a tale again, \"I wrote once on the seashore sand and signed my name beneath. A day later I came back to look, but neither name nor words remained. I was what I had been, and stood where the sea had been, but what I had written in sand affected me not, neither the sea nor any man. Thought I, if one had lent me money on such a perishable note the courts would now hold him at fault, not me; they would demand evidence, and all he could show them would be what he had himself bargained for. Now it occurs to me that seashore sand, and the tricks of rogues, and blackmail, and tyranny perhaps are one!\"",
    "Tugendheim, marching behind us, kept up an incessant growl. Ranjoor Singh, striding in front of us with the staff officer at his side, shook the rain from his shoulders and said nothing.\n\nWe were marched to a ferry and taken across what I know now was the Golden Horn; and there was so much mist on the water that at times we could scarcely see the ferry. Many troopers asked me if we were not already on our way to Gallipoli, and I, knowing no more than they, bade them wait and see.\n\nOn the other side of the Golden Horn we were marched through narrow streets, uphill, uphill, uphill to a very great barrack and given a section of it to ourselves. Ranjoor Singh was assigned private quarters in a part of the building used by many German officers for their mess. Not knowing our tongue, those officers were obliged to converse with him in English, and I observed many times with what distaste they did so, to my great amusement. I think Ranjoor Singh was also much amused by that, for he grew far better humored and readier to talk.\n\nSahib, that barrack was like a zoo--like the zoo I saw once at Baroda, with animals of all sorts in it!--a great yellow building within walls, packed with Kurds and Arabs and Syrians of more different tribes than a man would readily believe existed in the whole world. Few among them could talk any tongue that we knew, but they were full of curiosity and crowded round us to ask questions; and when Gooja Singh shouted aloud that we were Sikhs from India they produced a man who seemed to think he knew about Sikhs, for he stood on a step and harangued them for ten minutes, they listening with all their ears.\n\nThen came a Turk from the German officers' mess--we were all standing in the rain in an open court between four walls--and he told them truly who we were. Doubtless he added that we were in revolt against the British, for they began to welcome us, shouting and dancing about us, those who could come near enough taking our hands and saying things we could not understand.\n\nPresently they found a man who knew some English, and, urged by them, he began to fill our ears with information. During our train journey I had amused myself for many weary hours by asking Tugendheim for details of the fighting he had seen and by listening to the strings of lies he thought fit to narrate. But what Tugendheim had told were almost truths compared to this man's stories; in place of Tugendheim's studied vagueness there was detail in such profusion that I can not recall now the hundredth part of it.\n\nHe told us the British fleet had long been rusting at the bottom of the sea, and that all the British generals and half the army were prisoners in Berlin. Already the British were sending tribute money to their conquerors, and the principal reason why the war continued was that the British could not find enough donkeys to carry all the gold to Berlin, and to prevent trickery of any kind the fighting must continue until the last coin should have been counted.\n\nThe British and French, he told us, were all to be compelled, at the point of the sword, to turn Muhammadan, and France was being scoured that minute for women to grace the harems of the kaiser and his sons and generals, all of whom had long ago accepted Islam. The kaiser, indeed, had become the new chief of Islam.\n\nI asked him about the fighting in Gallipoli, and he said that was a bagatelle. \"When we shall have driven the remnants of those there into the sea,\" said he, \"one part of us will march to conquer Egypt and the rest will be sent to garrison England and France.\"\n\nWhen he had done and we were all under cover at last I repeated to the men all that this fool had said, and they were very much encouraged; for they reasoned that if the Turks and Germans needed to fill up their men with such lies as those, then they must have a poor case indeed. With our coats off, and a meal before us, and the mud and rain forgotten, we all began to feel almost happy; and while we were in that mood Ranjoor Singh came to us with Tugendheim at his heels.\n\n\"The plan now is to keep us here a week,\" said he. \"After that to send us to Gallipoli by steamer.\"\n\nSahib, there was uproar! Men could scarcely eat for the joy of getting in sight of British lines again--or rather for joy of the promise of it. They almost forgot to suspect Ranjoor Singh in that minute, but praised him to his face and even made much of Tugendheim.\n\nBut I, who followed Ranjoor Singh between the tables in case he should have any orders to give, noticed particularly that he did not say we were going to Gallipoli. He said, \"The plan now is to send us to Gallipoli.\" The trade of a leader of squadrons, thought I, is to confound the laid plans of the enemy and to invent unexpected ones of his own.\n\n\"The day we land in Gallipoli behind the Turkish trenches,\" said I to myself, \"is unlikely to be yet if Ranjoor Singh lives.\"",
    "Ranjoor Singh stood and shook himself, and moved slowly along the line to look in each man's face, and I took new courage from his bearing. If I could have known what he had in store for us, I would have leaped and shouted. Yet, no, sahib; that is not true. If he had told me what was coming, I would never have believed. Can the sahib imagine, for instance, what was to happen next?\n\n\"Ye are as good as dead men!\" he said, coming back to the center and facing all the men. \"Consider!\" said he. \"Our ship is sunk and the Turks, to save their own skins, will swear they saw us drown. Who, then, will come and hunt for dead men?\"\n\nI could see the eyes of the nearest men opening wider as new possibilities began to dawn. As for me--my two hands shook.\n\n\"And we have with us,\" said he, \"a hostage who might prove useful--a hostage who might prove amenable to reason. Bring out the prisoner!\" said he.\n\nSo I bade Tugendheim come forth. He was sitting on the straw where the guards had pushed him, still working sullenly to free his hands. He came and peered through the doorway into darkness, and Ranjoor Singh stood aside to let the men see him. They can not have seen much, for it was now that utter gloom that precedes dawn. Nor can Tugendheim have seen much.\n\n\"Do you wish to live or die?\" asked Ranjoor Singh, and the German gaped at him.\n\n\"That is a strange question!\" he said.\n\n\"Is it strange,\" asked Ranjoor Singh, \"that a prisoner should be asked for information?\"\n\n\"I am not afraid to die,\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"You mean by rifle-fire?\" asked Ranjoor Singh, and Tugendheim nodded.\n\n\"But there are other kinds of fire,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Tugendheim.\n\n\"Why,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"if we were to fire this hut to warm ourselves, and you should happen to be inside it--what then?\"\n\n\"If you intend to kill me,\" said Tugendheim, \"why not be merciful and shoot me?\" His voice was brave enough, but it seemed to me I detected a strain of terror in it.\n\n\"Few Germans are afraid to be shot to death,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"But what have I done to any of you that you should want to burn me alive?\" asked Tugendheim; and that time I was positive his voice was forced.\n\n\"Haven't you been told by your officers,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"that the custom of us Sikhs is to burn all our prisoners alive?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tugendheim. \"They told us that. But that was only a tale to encourage the first-year men. Having lived in India, I knew better.\"\n\n\"Did you trouble yourself to tell anybody better?\" asked Ranjoor Singh, but Tugendheim did not answer.\n\n\"Then can you give me any reason why you should not be burned alive here, now?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Tugendheim. \"It would be cruel. It would be devil's work!\" He was growing very uneasy, although trying hard not to show it.\n\n\"Then give me a name for the tales you have been party to against us Sikhs!\" said Ranjoor Singh; but once more the German refrained from answering. The men were growing very attentive, breathing all in unison and careful to make no sound to disturb the talking. At that instant a great burst of firing broke out over the water, so far away that I could only see one or two flashes, and, although that was none too reassuring to us, it seemed to Tugendheim like his death knell. He set his lips and drew back half a step.\n\n\"Can you wish to live with the shame of all those lies against us on your heart--you, who have lived in India and know so much better?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Of course I wish to live!\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"Have you any price to offer for your life?\" asked Ranjoor Singh, and stepping back two paces he ordered a havildar with a loud voice to take six men and hunt for dry kindling. \"For there is not enough here,\" said he.\n\n\"Price?\" said Tugendheim. \"I have a handful of coins, and my uniform, and a sword. You left my baggage on the steamer--\"\n\n\"Nay!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Your baggage came ashore in one of the boats. Where is it? Who has it?\"\n\nA man stepped forward and pointed to it, lying in the shadow of the hut with the rain from the roof dripping down on it.\n\n\"Who brought it ashore?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"I,\" said the trooper.\n\n\"Then, for leaving it there in the rain, you shall carry it three days without assistance or relief!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Get back to your place in the ranks!\" And the man got back, saying nothing. Ranjoor Singh picked up the baggage and tossed it past Tugendheim into the hut.\n\n\"That is all I have!\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"If you decide to burn, it shall burn with you,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"and that trooper shall carry a good big stone instead to teach him manners!\"\n\n\"GOTT IN HIMMEL!\" exclaimed Tugendheim, losing his self-control at last. \"Can I offer what I have not got?\"\n\n\"Is there nothing you can do?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"In what way? How?\" asked the German.\n\n\"In the way of making amends to us Sikhs for all those lies you have been party to,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"If you were willing to offer to make amends, I would listen to you.\"\n\n\"I will do anything in reason,\" said Tugendheim, looking him full in the eye and growing more at ease.\n\n\"I am a reasonable man,\" said Ranjoor Singh.",
    "It was a pitiable effort, for our bellies yearned and our feet were sore and stiff. We stumbled from weariness, and men fell and were helped up again. Gooja Singh and his ammunition bearers made more noise than a squadron of mounted cavalry, and the way proved twice as long as the most hopeless had expected. Yet we made the circuit unseen and, as far as we knew, unheard--certainly unchallenged. Doubtless, as Ranjoor Singh said afterward, the Turks were too overriden by Germans and the Germans too overconfident to suspect the presence of an enemy. At any rate, although we made more noise than was expedient, we halted at last among low bushes and beheld nine or ten Turkish sentries posted along the rim of a rise, all unaware of us. Two were fast asleep. Some sat. The others drowsed, leaning on their rifles. Ranjoor Singh gave us whispered orders and we rushed them, only one catching sight of us in time to raise an alarm. He fired his rifle, but hit nobody, and in another second they were all surrounded and disarmed.\n\nThen, down in the hollow we saw many little campfires, each one reflected in the water. Some Turks and about fifty men of another nation sat up and rubbed their eyes, and a Turkish captain--an upstanding flabby man, came out from the only tent to learn what the trouble might be. Ranjoor Singh strode down into the hollow and enlightened him, we standing around the rim of the rise with our bayonets fixed and rifles at the \"ready.\" I did not hear what Ranjoor Singh said to the Turkish captain because he left me to prevent the men from stampeding toward the smell of food--no easy task.\n\nAfter five minutes he shouted for Tugendheim, and the German went down the slope visibly annoyed by the four guards who kept their bayonets within a yard of his back. It was a fortunate circumstance for us, not only then but very many times, that Tugendheim would have thought himself disgraced by appealing to a Turk. Seeing there was no German officer in the hollow, he adopted his arrogant manner, and the Turkish officer drew back from him like a man stung. After that the Turkish captain appeared to resign himself to impotence, for he ordered his men to pile arms and retired into his tent.\n\nThen Ranjoor Singh came up the slope and picked the twenty men who seemed least ready to drop with weariness, of whom I regretted to be one. He set us on guard where the Turkish sentries had been, and the Turks were sent below, where presently they fell asleep among their brethren, as weary, no doubt, from plundering as we were from marching on empty bellies. None of them seemed annoyed to be disarmed. Strange people! Fierce, yet strangely tolerant!\n\nThen all the rest of the men, havildars no whit behind the rest, swooped down on the camp-fires, and presently the smell of toasting corn began to rise, until my mouth watered and my belly yearned. Fifteen or twenty minutes later (it seemed like twenty hours, sahib!) hot corn was brought to us and we on guard began to be new men. Nevertheless, food made the guard more sleepy, and I was hard put to it walking from one to another keeping them awake.\n\nAll that night I knew nothing of what passed in the camp below, but I learned later on that Ranjoor Singh found among the Syrians whose business was to load and drive carts a man named Abraham. All in the camp who were not Turks were Syrians, and these Syrians had been dragged away from their homes scores of leagues away and made to labor without remuneration. This Abraham was a gifted man, who had been in America, and knew English, as well as several dialects of Kurdish, and Turkish and Arabic and German. He knew better German than English, and had frequently been made to act interpreter. Later, when we marched together, he and I became good friends, and he told me many things.\n\nWell, sahib, after he had eaten a little corn, Ranjoor Singh questioned this man Abraham, and then went with him through the camp, examining the plunder the Turks had seen fit to requisition. It was plain that this particular Turkish officer was no paragon of all the virtues, and Ranjoor Singh finally entered his tent unannounced, taking Abraham with him. So it was that I learned the details later, for Abraham told me all I asked.\n\nOn a box beside the bed Ranjoor Singh found writing-paper, envelopes, and requisition forms not yet filled out, but already signed with a seal and a Turkish signature. There was a map, and a list of routes and villages. But best of all was a letter of instructions signed by a German officer. There were also other priceless things, of some of which I may chance to speak later.\n\nI was told by Abraham that during the conversation following Ranjoor Singh's seizure of the papers the word Wassmuss was bandied back and forth a thousand times, the Turk growing rather more amenable each time the word was used. Finally the Turk resigned himself with a shrug of the shoulders, and was left in his tent with a guard of our men at each corner.\n\nThen, for all that the night was black dark and there were very few lanterns, the camp began to be turned upside down, Ranjoor Singh ordering everything thrown aside that could not be immediately useful to us. There were forty carts, burdened to the breaking point, and twenty of them Ranjoor Singh abandoned as too heavy for our purpose. Most of the carts had been drawn by teams of six mules each, but ten of them had been drawn by horses, and besides the Turkish captain's horse there were four other spare ones. There were also about a hundred sheep and some goats.\n\nRanjoor Singh ordered all the corn repacked into fourteen of the carts, sheep and goats into four carts, and ammunition into the remaining two, leaving room in each cart for two men so that the guard who had stood awake all night might ride and sleep. That left him with sixty-four spare horses. Leaving the Turkish officer his own horse, but taking the saddle for himself, he gave Tugendheim one, me another, the third to Gooja Singh--he being next non-commissioned officer to me in order of seniority, and having had punishment enough--and the fourth horse, that was much the best one, he himself took. Then he chose sixty men to cease from being infantry and become a sort of cavalry again--cavalry without saddles as yet, or stirrups--cavalry with rifles--cavalry with aching feet--but cavalry none the less. He picked the sixty with great wisdom, choosing for the most part men who had given no trouble, but he included ten or twelve grumblers, although for a day or two I did not understand why. There was forethought in everything he did.\n\nThe sheep that could not be crowded into the carts he ordered butchered there and then, and the meat distributed among the men; and all the plunder that he decided not to take he ordered heaped in one place where it would not be visible unless deliberately looked for. The plundered money that he found in the Turk's tent he hid under the corn in the foremost cart, and we found it very useful later on. The few of our men who had not fallen asleep were for burning the piled-up plunder, but he threatened to shoot whoever dared set match to it.\n\n\"Shall we light a beacon to warn the countryside?\" said he.",
    "We were far in among the hills now--little low hills with broad open spaces between, in which thousands of cattle could have grazed. Only there were no cattle. I rode, as Ranjoor Singh usually did, twenty or thirty horses' length away on the right flank, well forward, where I could see the whole column with one quick turn of the head. I had ten troopers riding a quarter of a mile in front, and a rear-guard of ten more, but none riding on the flanks because to our left the hills were steep and impracticable and to our right I could generally see for miles, although not always.\n\nWe dipped into a hollow, and I thought I heard rifle shots. I urged my horse uphill, and sent him up a steep place from the top of which I had a fine view. Then I heard many shots, and looked, and lo a battle was before my eyes. Not a great battle--really only a skirmish, although to my excited mind it seemed much more at first. And the first one I recognized taking his part in it was Ranjoor Singh.\n\nI could see no infantry at all. About a hundred Turkish cavalry were being furiously attacked by sixty or seventy mounted men who looked like Kurds, and who turned out later really to be Kurds. The Kurds were well mounted, riding recklessly, firing from horseback at full gallop and wasting great quantities of ammunition.\n\nThe shooting must have been extremely bad, for I could see neither dead bodies nor empty saddles, but nevertheless the Turks appeared anxious to escape--the more so because Ranjoor Singh with his forty men was heading them off. As I watched, one of them blew a trumpet and they all retreated helter-skelter toward us--straight toward us. There was nothing else they could do, now that they had given way. It was like the letter Y--thus, sahib,--see, I draw in the dust--the Kurds coming this way at an angle--Ranjoor Singh and his forty coming this way--and we advancing toward them all along the bottom stroke of the Y, with hills around forming an arena. The best the Turks could do would have been to take the higher ground where we were and there reform, except for the fact that we had come on the scene unknown to them. Now that we had arrived, they were caught in a trap.\n\nThere was plenty of time, especially as we were hidden from view, but I worked swiftly, the men obeying readily enough now that a fight seemed certain. I posted Tugendheim with his Syrians in the center, with the rest of us in equal halves to right and left, keeping Abraham by me and giving Anim Singh, as next to me in seniority, command of our left wing. We were in a rough new moon formation, all well under cover, with the carts in a hollow to our rear. By the time I was ready, the oncoming Turks were not much more than a quarter of a mile away; and now I could see empty saddles at last, for some of the Kurds had dismounted and were firing from the ground with good effect.\n\nI gave no order to open fire until they came within three hundred yards of us. Then I ordered volleys, and the Syrians forthwith made a very great noise at high speed, our own troopers taking their time, and aiming low as ordered. We cavalrymen are not good shots as a rule, rather given, in fact, to despising all weapons except the lance and saber, and perhaps a pistol on occasion. But the practise in Flanders had worked wonders, and at our first volley seven or eight men rolled out of the saddles, the horses continuing to gallop on toward us.\n\nThe surprise was so great that the Turks drew rein, and we gave them three more volleys while they considered matters, bringing down a number of them. They seemed to have no officer, and were much confused. Not knowing who we were, they turned away from us and made as if to surrender to the enemy they did know, but the Kurds rode in on them and in less than five minutes there was not one Turk left alive. My men were for rushing down to secure the loot, but it seemed likely to me that the Kurds might mistake that for hostility and I prevailed on the men to keep still until Ranjoor Singh should come. And presently I saw Ranjoor Singh ride up to the leader of the Kurds and talk with him, using our Turkish officer prisoner as interpreter. Presently he and the Kurdish chief rode together toward us, and the Kurd looked us over, saying nothing. (Ranjoor Singh told me afterward that the Kurd wished to be convinced that we were many enough to enforce fair play.)\n\nThe long and the short of it was that we received half the captured horses--that is, thirty-five, for some had been killed--and all the saddles, no less than ninety of them, besides mauser rifles and uniforms for our ten unarmed Syrians. The Kurds took all the remainder, watching to make sure that the Syrians, whom we sent to help themselves to uniforms, took nothing else. When the Kurds had finished looting, they rode away toward the south without so much as a backward glance at us.\n\nI asked Ranjoor Singh how Turkish cavalry had come to let themselves get caught thus unsupported, and he said he did not know. \"Yet I have learned something,\" he said. \"I shot the Turkish commander's horse myself, and my men pounced on him. That demoralized his men and made the rest easy. Now, I have questioned the Turk, and between him and the Kurdish chief I have discovered good reason to hurry forward.\"\n\n\"I would weigh that Kurd's information twice!\" said I. \"He cut those Turks down in cold blood. What is he but a cutthroat robber?\"\n\n\"Let him weigh what I told him, then, three times!\" he answered with a laugh. \"Have you any men hurt?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I.\n\n\"Then give me a mile start, and follow!\" he ordered. And in another minute he was riding away at the head of his forty, slowly for sake of the horses, but far faster than I could go with all those laden carts. And I had to give a start of much more than a mile because of the trouble we had in fitting the saddles to our mounts. I wished he had left the captured Turkish officer behind to explain his nation's cursed saddle straps!",
    "Rather than have him look like a Turk any longer, we had dressed up Abraham in the uniform of one of our dead troopers; and when at last a Kurdish chief rode up with a hundred men at his back and demanded to know our business, Ranjoor Singh called Abraham to interpret. We could easily have beaten a mere hundred Kurds, but to have won a skirmish just then would have helped us almost as little as to lose one. What we wanted was free leave to ride forward.\n\n\"Where are ye, and whither are ye bound? What seek ye?\" the Kurd demanded, but Ranjoor Singh proved equal to the occasion.\n\n\"We be troops from India,\" said he. \"We have been fighting in Europe on the side of France and England, and the Germans and Turks have been so badly beaten that you see for yourself what is happening. Behold us! We are an advance party. These Turkish officers you see are prisoners we have taken on our way. Behold, we have also a German prisoner! You will find all the Turks between here and Syria in a state of panic, and if plunder is what you desire you would better make haste and get what you can before the great armies come eating the land like locusts! Plunder the Turks and prove yourselves the friends of French and English!\"\n\nSahib, those Kurds would rather loot than go to heaven, and, like all wild people, they are very credulous. There are Kurds and Kurds and Kurds, nations within a nation, speaking many dialects of one tongue. Some of them are half-tame and live on the plains; those the Turks are able to draft into their armies to some extent. Some of the plainsmen, like those I speak of now, are altogether wild and will not serve the Turks on any terms. And most of the hillmen prefer to shoot a Turk on sight. I would rather fight a pig with bare hands than try to stand between a Kurd and Turkish plunder, and it only needed just those few words of Ranjoor Singh's to set that part of the world alight!\n\nWe rode for very many days after that, following the course of the Tigris unmolested. The tale Ranjoor Singh told had gone ahead of us. The village Kurds waited to have one look, saw our Turkish prisoners and our Sikh turbans, judged for themselves, and were off! I believe we cost the Turkish garrisons in those parts some grim fighting; and if any Turks were on our trail I dare wager they met a swarm or two of hornets more than they bargained for!\n\nInstead of having to fight our way through that country, we were well received. Wherever we found Kurds, either in tents or in villages, the unveiled women would give us DU, as they call their curds and whey, and barley for our horses, and now and then a little bread. When other persuasion failed, we could buy almost anything they had with a handful or two of cartridges. They were a savage people, but not altogether unpleasing.\n\nOnce, where the Tigris curved and our road brought us near the banks, by a high cliff past which the river swept at very great speed, we took part in a sport that cost us some cartridges, but no risk, and gave us great amusement. The Kurds of those parts, having heard in advance of our tale of victory, had decided, to take the nearest loot to hand; so they had made an ambuscade down near the river level, and when we came on the scene we lent a hand from higher up.\n\nRushing down the river at enormous speed (for the stream was narrow there) forced between rocks with a roar and much white foam the goatskin rafts kept coming on their way to Mosul and Bagdad, some loaded with soldiers, some with officers, and all with goods on which the passengers must sit to keep their legs dry. The rafts were each managed by two men, who worked long oars to keep them in mid-current, they turning slowly round and round.\n\nThe mode of procedure was to volley at them, shooting, if possible, the men with oars, but not despising a burst goatskin bag. In case the men with oars were shot, the others would try to take their place, and, being unskilful, would very swiftly run the raft against a rock, when it would break up and drown its passengers, the goods drifting ashore at the bend in the river in due time.\n\nOn the other hand, when a few goatskin bags were pierced the raft would begin to topple over and the men with oars would themselves direct the raft toward the shore, preferring to take their chance among Kurds than with the rocks that stuck up like fangs out of the raging water. No, sahib, I could not see what happened to them after they reached shore. That is a savage country.\n\nOne of our first volleys struck a raft so evenly and all together that it blew up as if it had been torpedoed! We tried again and again to repeat that performance, until Ranjoor Singh checked us for wasting ammunition. It was very good sport. There were rafts and rafts and rafts--KYAKS, I think they call them--and the amount of plunder those Kurds collected on the beach must have been astonishing.\n\nWe gave the city of Mosul a very wide berth, for that is the largest city of those parts, with a very large Turkish garrison. Twenty miles to the north of it we captured a good convoy of mules, together with their drivers, headed toward Mosul, and the mul",
    "We had scarcely ridden three hundred yards into the defile of which I speak, remarking the signs of another small body of mounted men who had preceded us, when fifty shots rang out from overhead and we took open order as if a shell had burst among us. Nobody was hit, however, and I think nobody was intended to be hit. I saw that Ranjoor Singh looked unalarmed. He beckoned for Abraham, who looked terrified, and I took Abraham by the shoulder and brought him forward. There came a wild yell from overhead, and Ranjoor Singh made Abraham answer it with something about Wassmuss. In the shouting that followed I caught the word Wassmuss many times.\n\nPresently a Kurdish chief came galloping down, for all the world as one of our Indian mountaineers would ride, leaping his horse from rock to rock as if he and the beast were one. I rode to Ranjoor Singh's side, to protect him if need be, so I heard what followed, Abraham translating.\n\n\"Whence are ye?\" said the Kurd. \"And whither? And what will ye?\" They are inquisitive people, and they always seem to wish to know those three things first.\n\n\"I have told you already, I ride from Farangistan, [Footnote: Europe] and I seek Wassmuss. These are my men,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"No more may reach Wassmuss unless they have the money with them!\" said the Kurd, very truculently. \"Two days ago we let by the last party of men who carried only talk. Now we want only money!\"\n\n\"Who was ever helped by impatience?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Kurd, \"we are a patient folk! We have waited eighteen days for sight of this gold for Wassmuss. It should have been here fifteen days ago, so Wassmuss said, but we are willing to wait eighteen more. Until it comes, none else shall pass!\"\n\nI was watching Ranjoor Singh very closely indeed, and I saw that he saw daylight, as it were, through darkness.\n\n\"Yet no gold shall come,\" he answered, \"until you and I shall have talked together, and shall have reached an agreement.\"\n\n\"Agreement?\" said the Kurd. \"Ye have my word! Ride back and bid them bring their gold in safety and without fear!\"\n\n\"Without fear?\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Then who are ye?\"\n\n\"We,\" said the Kurd, \"are the escort, to bring the gold in safety through the mountain passes.\"\n\n\"So that he may divide it among others?\" asked Ranjoor Singh, and I saw the Kurd wince. \"Gold is gold!\" he went on. \"Who art thou to let by an opportunity?\"\n\n\"Speak plain words,\" said the Kurd.\n\n\"Here?\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"Here in this defile, where men might come on us from the rear at any minute?\"\n\n\"That they can not do,\" the Kurd answered, \"for my men watch from overhead.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"I will speak no plain words here.\"\n\nThe Kurd looked long at him--at least a whole minute. Then he wiped his nose on the long sleeve of his tunic and turned about. \"Come in peace!\" he said, spurring his horse.\n\nRanjoor Singh followed him, and we followed Ranjoor Singh, without one word spoken or order given. The Kurd led straight up the defile for a little way, then sharp to the right and uphill along a path that wound among great boulders, until at last we halted, pack-mules and all, in a bare arena formed by a high cliff at the rear and on three sides by gigantic rocks that fringed it, making a natural fort.\n\n\nThe Kurd's men were mostly looking out from between the rocks, but some of them were sprawling in the shadow of a great boulder in the midst, and some were attending to the horses that stood tethered in a long line under the cliff at the rear. The chief drove away those who lay in the shadow of the boulder in the midst, and bade Ranjoor Singh and me and Abraham be seated. Ranjoor Singh called up the other daffadars, and we all sat facing the Kurd, with Abraham a little to one side between him and us, to act interpreter. That was the first time Ranjoor Singh had taken so many at once into his confidence and I took it for a good sign, although unable to ignore a twinge of jealousy.\n\n\"Now?\" said the Kurd. \"Speak plain words!\"\n\n\"You have not yet offered us food,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\nThe Kurd stared hard at him, eye to eye. \"I have good reason,\" he answered. \"By our law, he who eats our bread can not be treated as an enemy. If I feed you, how can I let my men attack you afterward?\"\n\n\"You could not,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"We, too, have a law, that he with whom we have eaten salt is not enemy but friend. Let us eat bread and salt together, then, for I have a plan.\"\n\n\"A plan?\" said the Kurd. \"What manner of a plan? I await gold. What are words?\"\n\n\"A good plan,\" said Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"And on the strength of an empty boast am I to eat bread and salt with you?\" the Kurd asked.\n\n\"If you wish to hear the plan,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"To my enemy I tell nothing; however, let my friend but ask!\"\n\nThe Kurd thought a long time, but we facing him added no word to encourage or confuse him. I saw that his curiosity increased the more the longer we were silent; yet I doubt whether his was greater than my own! Can the sahib guess what Ranjoor Singh's plan was? Nay, that Kurd was no great fool. He was in the dark. He saw swiftly enough when explanations came.\n\n\"I have three hundred mounted men!\" the Kurd said at last.\n\n\"And I near as many!\" answered Ranjoor Singh. \"I crave no favors! I come with an offer, as one leader to another!\"\n\nThe Kurd frowned and hesitated, but sent at last for bread and salt, for all our party, except that he ordered his men to give none to our prisoners and none to the Syrians, whom he mistook for Turkish soldiers. If Ranjoor Singh had told him they were Syrians he would have refused the more, for Kurds regard Syrians as wolves regard sheep.\n\n\"Let the prisoners be,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"but feed those others! They must help put through the plan!\"\n\nSo the Kurd ordered our Syrians, whom he thought Turks, fed too, and we dipped the flat bread (something like our Indian chapatties) into salt and ate, facing one another.\n\n\"Now speak, and we listen,\" said the Kurd when we had finished. Some of his men had come back, clustering around him, and we were quite a party, filling all the shadow of the great rock.\n\n\"How much of that gold was to have been yours?\" asked Ranjoor Singh, and the Kurd's eyes blazed. \"Wassmuss promised me so-and-so much,\" he answered, \"if I with three hundred men wait here for the convoy and escort it to where he waits.\"\n\n\"But why do ye serve Wassmuss?\" asked Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Because he buys friendship, as other men buy ghee, or a horse, or ammunition,\" said the Kurd. \"He spends gold like water, saying it is German gold, and in return for it we must harry the British and Russians.\"\n\n\"Yet you and I are friends by bread and salt,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"and I offer you all this gold, whereas he offers only part of it! Nay, I and my men need none of it--I offer it all!\"\n\n\"At what price?\" asked the Kurd, suspiciously. Doubtless men who need no gold were as rare among these mountains as in other places!\n\n\"I shall name a price,\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"A low price. We shall both be content with our bargain, and possibly Wassmuss, too, may feel satisfied for a while.\"\n\n\"Nay, you must be a wizard!\" said the Kurd. \"Speak on!\"",
    "The Turks down on the plain were studying the sky, too. We could see them fix bayonets and make little trenches about the tents. Another party of them gathered stones with which to re-enforce the tent pegs, and in every other way possible they made ready against one of those swift, sudden storms that so often burst down the sides of mountains. Most of us had experienced such storms a dozen times or more in the foot-hills of our Himalayas, and all of us knew the signs. As evening fell the sky to our rear grew blacker than night itself and a chill swept down the defile like the finger of death.\n\n\"Repack the camp,\" commanded Ranjoor Singh. \"Stow everything in the cave.\"\n\nThere was grumbling, for we had all looked forward to a warm night's rest.\n\n\"To-night your hearts must warm you!\" he said, striding to and fro to make sure his orders were obeyed. It was dark by the time we had finished, Then he made us fall in, in our ragged overcoats--aye, ragged, for those German overcoats had served as coats and tents and what-not, and were not made to stand the wear of British ones in any case--unmounted he made us fall in, at which there was grumbling again.\n\n\"Ye shall prove to-night,\" he said, \"whether ye can endure what mules and horses never could! Warmth ye shall have, if your hearts are true, but the man who can keep dry shall be branded for a wizard! Imagine yourselves back in Flanders!\"\n\nMost of us shuddered. I know I did. The wind had begun whimpering, and every now and then would whistle and rise into a scream. A few drops of heavy rain fell. Then would come a lull, while we could feel the air grow colder. Our Flanders experience was likely to stand us in good stead.\n\nTugendheim and the Syrians were left in charge of our belongings. There was nothing else to do with them because the Syrians were in more deathly fear of the storm than they ever had been of Turks. Nevertheless, we did not find them despicable. Unmilitary people though they were, they had marched and endured and labored like good men, but certain things they seemed to accept as being more than men could overcome, and this sort of storm apparently was one of them. We tied the mules and horses very carefully, because we did not believe the Syrians would stand by when the storm began, and we were right. Tugendheim begged hard to be allowed to come with us, but Ranjoor Singh would not let him. I don't know why, but I think he suspected Tugendheim of knowing something about the German officers who were ahead of us, in which case Tugendheim was likely to risk anything rather than continue going forward; and, having promised him to the Kurdish chief, it would not have suited Ranjoor Singh to let him escape into Turkey again.\n\nThe ten Kurds who had been left with us as guides and to help us keep peace among the mountains all volunteered to lend a hand in the fight, and Ranjoor Singh accepted gladly. The hostages, on the other hand, were a difficult problem; for they detested being hostages. They would have made fine allies for Tugendheim, supposing he had meditated any action in our rear. They could have guided him among the mountains with all our horses and mules and supplies. And suppose he had made up his mind to start through the storm to find Wassmuss with their aid, what could have prevented him? He might betray us to Wassmuss as the price of his own forgiveness. So we took the hostages with us, and when we found a place between some rocks where they could have shelter we drove them in there, setting four troopers to guard them. Thus Tugendheim was kept in ignorance of their whereabouts, and with no guides to help him play us false. As for the Greek doctor, we took him with us, too, for we were likely to need his services that night, and in truth we did.\n\nWe started the instant the storm began--twenty minutes or more before it settled down to rage in earnest. That enabled us to march about two-thirds of the way toward the Turkish camp and to deploy into proper formation before the hail came and made it impossible to hear even a shout. Hitherto the rain had screened us splendidly, although it drenched us to the skin, and the noise of rain and wind prevented the noise we made from giving the alarm; but when the hail began I could not hear my own foot-fall. Ranjoor Singh roared out the order to double forward, but could make none hear, so he seized a rifle from the nearest man and fired it off. Perhaps a dozen men heard that and began to double. The remainder saw, and followed suit.\n\nThe hail was in our backs. No man ever lived who could have charged forward into it, and not one of the Turkish sentries made pretense at anything but running for his life. Long before we reached their posts they were gone, and a flash of lightning showed the tents blown tighter than drums in the gaining wind and white with the hailstones. When we reached the tents there was hail already half a foot deep underfoot where the wind had blown it into drifts, and the next flash of lightning showed one tent--the bimbashi's own--split open and blown fluttering into strips. The bimbashi rushed out with a blanket round his head and shoulders and tried to kick men out of another tent to make room for him, and failing to do that he scrambled in on top of them. Opening the tent let the wind in, and that tent, too, split and fluttered and blew away. And so at last they saw us coming.\n\nThey saw us when we were so close that there was no time to do much else than run away or surrender. Quite a lot of them ran away I imagine, for they disappeared. The bimbashi tried to pistol Ranjoor Singh, and died for his trouble on a trooper's bayonet. Some of the Turks tried to fight, and they were killed. Those who surrendered were disarmed and driven away into the storm, and the last we saw of them was when a flash of lightning showed them hurrying helter-skelter through the hail with hands behind their defenseless heads trying to ward off hailstones. They looked very ridiculous, and I remember I laughed.",
    "After a few days (I forget how many, for who can remember all the days and distances of that long march?) Abraham got word of a great Christian mission station where thousands of Christians had sought safety under the American flag. He and his Syrians elected to try their fortune there, and we let them go, all of us saluting Abraham, for he was a good brave man, fearful, but able to overcome his fear, and intelligent far beyond the ordinary. We let the Syrians take their rifles and some ammunition with them, because Abraham said they might be called on perhaps to help defend the mission.\n\nNot long after that, we let our Kurds go, giving up our Turkish officer prisoners and Tugendheim as well. We all knew by that time what our final goal was, and Tugendheim begged to be allowed to go with us all the way. But Ranjoor Singh refused him.\n\n\"I promised you to the Kurd, and the Kurd will trade you to Wassmuss against his brother,\" he said. \"Tell Wassmuss whatever lies you like, and make your peace with your own folk however you can. Here is your paper back.\"\n\nTugendheim took the paper. (You remember, sahib, he had signed a receipt in conjunction with the Turkish mate and captain of that ship in which we escaped from Stamboul.) Well, he took the paper back, and burned it in the little fire by which I was sitting facing Ranjoor Singh.\n\n\"Let me go with you!\" he urged. \"It will be rope or bullet for me if ever I get back to Germany!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Ranjoor Singh, \"I promised to deliver you to Wassmuss when we made you prisoner in the first place. I must keep my word to you!\"\n\n\"I release you from your word to me!\" said Tugendheim.\n\n\"And I promised you to the Kurdish chief.\"\n\n\"The Kurdish chief?\" said Tugendheim. \"What of him? What of it? Why, why, why--he is a savage--scarcely human--not to be weighed in the scales against a civilized man! What does such a promise as that amount to?\" And he stood tugging at his mustaches as if he would tear them out.\n\n\"I have some gold left,\" said Ranjoor Singh, when he was sure Tugendheim had no more to say, \"and I had seriously thought of buying you for gold from these Kurds. There may be one of them who would take on himself the responsibility of speaking for his chief. But since you hold my given word so light as that I must look more nearly to my honor. Nay, go with the Kurds, Sergeant Tugendheim!\"\n\nTugendheim made a great wail. He begged for this, and he begged for that. He begged us to give him a letter to Wassmuss explaining that we had compelled him by threats of torture. He begged for gold. And Ranjoor Singh gave him a little gold. Some of us put in a word for him, for on that long journey he had told many a tale to make us laugh. He had suffered with us. He had helped us more than a little by drilling the Syrians, and often his presence with us had saved our skins by convincing Turkish scouts of our bona fides. We thought of Gooja Singh, and had no wish that Tugendheim should meet a like fate. So, perhaps because we all begged for him, or perhaps because he so intended in the first place, Ranjoor Singh relented.\n\n\"The Persians hereabouts,\" he said, \"all tell me that a great Russian army will come down presently from the north. Have I heard correctly that you meditated escape into Russia?\"\n\nTugendheim answered, \"How should I reach Russia?\"\n\n\"That is thy affair!\" said Ranjoor Singh. \"But here is more gold,\" and he counted out to him ten more golden German coins. \"You must ride back with these Kurds, but I have no authority over them. They are not my men. They seem to like gold more than most things.\"\n\nSo Tugendheim ceased begging for himself and rode away rather despondently in the midst of the Kurds; and we followed about a day and a half behind the German party with their strange box-full of machinery. There were many of us who could talk Persian, and as we stopped in the villages to beg or buy curdled milk, and as we rounded up the cattle-herdsmen and the women by the wells, we heard many strange and wonderful stories about what the engine in that box could do. I observed that Ranjoor Singh looked merry-eyed when the wildest stories reached him; but we all began to reflect on the disastrous consequences of letting such crafty people reach Afghanistan. For, as doubtless the sahib knows, the amir of Afghanistan has a very great army; and if he were to decide that the German side is after all the winning one he might make very much trouble for the government of India.\n\nAnd now there was no longer any doubt that the machine slung in the box between two mules was a wireless telegraph, and that most of the other mules were loaded with accessories. The tales we heard could not be made to tally with any other explanation. And what, said we, was to prevent the Germans in Stamboul from signaling whatever lies they could invent to this party in Afghanistan, supposing they should ever reach the country? Yet when we argued thus with Ranjoor Singh, he laughed.\n\nAnd then, after about a week of marching, came Tugendheim back to us, ragged and thirsty and nearly dead, on a horse more dead than he. He had bought himself free from the Kurds with the gold Ranjoor Singh gave him; but because he had no more gold the Persians had refused to feed him. \"How should he find his way alone to meet the Russians,\" he said, \"whose scouts would probably shoot him on sight in any case?\" So we laughed, and let him rest among our wounded and be one of us,--aye, one of us; for who were we to turn him away to starve? He had served us well, and he served us well again.\n\nHas the sahib heard of Bakhtiari Khans? They are people as fierce as Kurds, who live like the Kurds by plundering. The Germans ahead of us, doubtless because Persia is neutral in this war and therefore they had no conceivable right to be crossing the country, chose a route that avoided all towns and cities of considerable size. And Persia seems to have no army any more, so that there was no official opposition. But the Bakhtiari Khans received word of what was doing, and after that there were new problems. But for the fact that Tugendheim was with us in his ragged German uniform we should have had more trouble than we did.\n\nAt first the Khans were content with blackmail, holding up the Germans at intervals and demanding money. But I suppose that finally their money all gave out, and then the Kahns put threats into practise. But before actual skirmishing began the Khans would come to us, after getting money from the Germans, and it was only the fact that we had Tugendheim to show that convinced them we belonged to the party ahead. Ranjoor Singh claimed that our transit fee had been paid for us already, and the Khans did not deny it."

  "Edgar Wallace -- Bones in London": [
    "There was a slump in the shipping market, and men who were otherwise decent citizens wailed for one hour of glorious war, when Kenyon Line Deferred had stood at 88 1/2, and even so poor an organization as Siddons Steam Packets Line had been marketable at 3 3/8. Two bareheaded men came down the busy street, their hands thrust into their trousers pockets, their sleek, well-oiled heads bent in dejection.\n\nNo word they spoke, keeping step with the stern precision of soldiers. Together they wheeled through the open doors of the Commercial Trust Building, together they left-turned into the elevator, and simultaneously raised their heads to examine its roof, as though in its panelled ceiling was concealed some Delphic oracle who would answer the riddle which circumstances had set them. They dropped their heads together and stood with sad eyes, regarding the attendant's leisurely unlatching of the gate.  They slipped forth and walked in single file to a suite of offices inscribed \"Pole Brothers, Brokers,\" and, beneath, \"The United Merchant Shippers' Corporation,\" and passed through a door which, in addition to this declaration, bore the footnote \"Private.\"\n\nHere the file divided, one going to one side of a vast pedestal desk and one to the other. Still with their hands pushed deep into their pockets, they sank, almost as at a word of command, each into his cushioned chair, and stared at one another across the table.\n\nThey were stout young men of the middle thirties, clean-shaven and ruddy. They had served their country in the late War, and had made many sacrifices to the common cause. One had worn uniform and one had not. Joe had occupied some mysterious office which permitted and, indeed, enjoined upon him the wearing of the insignia of captain, but had forbidden him to leave his native land. The other had earned a little decoration with a very big title as a buyer of boots for Allied nations. Both had subscribed largely to War Stock, and a reminder of their devotion to the cause of liberty was placed to their credit every half-year.\n\nBut for these, war, with its horrific incidents, its late hours, its midnight railway journeys by trains on which sleeping berths could not be had for love or money, its food cards and statements of excess profits, was past. The present held its tragedy so poignant as to overshadow that breathless terrifying moment when peace had come and found the firm with the sale of the Fairy Line of cargo steamers uncompleted, contracts unsigned, and shipping stock which had lived light-headedly in the airy spaces, falling deflated on the floor of the house.\n\nThe Fairy Line was not a large line. It was, in truth, a small line. It might have been purchased for two hundred thousand pounds, and nearly was. To-day it might be acquired for one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and yet it wasn't.\n\n\"Joe,\" said the senior Mr. Pole, in a voice that came from his varnished boots, \"we've got to do something with Fairies.\"\n\n\"Curse this War!\" said Joe in cold-blooded even tones. \"Curse the Kaiser! A weak-kneed devil who might at least have stuck to it for another month! Curse him for making America build ships, curse him for----\"\n\n\"Joe,\" said the stout young man on the other side of the table, shaking his head sadly, \"it is no use cursing, Joe. We knew that they were building ships, but the business looked good to me. If Turkey hadn't turned up her toes and released all that shipping----\"\n\n\"Curse Turkey!\" said the other, with great calmness. \"Curse the Sultan and Enver and Taalat, curse Bulgaria and Ferdinand----\"\n\n\"Put in one for the Bolsheviks, Joe,\" said his brother urgently, \"and I reckon that gets the lot in trouble. Don't start on Austria, or we'll find ourselves cursing the Jugo-Slavs.\"\n\nHe sighed deeply, pursed his lips, and looked at his writing-pad intently.\n\nJoe and Fred Pole had many faults, which they freely admitted, such as their generosity, their reckless kindness of heart, their willingness to do their worst enemies a good turn, and the like. They had others which they never admitted, but which were none the less patent to their prejudiced contemporaries.\n\nBut they had virtues which were admirable. They were, for example, absolutely loyal to one another, and were constant in their mutual admiration and help. If Joe made a bad deal, Fred never rested until he had balanced things against the beneficiary. If Fred in a weak moment paid a higher price to the vendor of a property than he, as promoter, could afford, it was Joe who took the smug vendor out to dinner and, by persuasion, argument, and the frank expression of his liking for the unfortunate man, tore away a portion of his ill-gotten gains.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Joe, concluding his minatory exercises, and reaching for a cigar from the silver box which stood on the table midway between the two, \"I suppose we couldn't hold Billing to his contract. Have you seen Cole about it, Fred?\"\n\nThe other nodded slowly.\n\n\"Cole says that there is no contract. Billing offered to buy the ships, and meant to buy them, undoubtedly; but Cole says that if you took Billing into court, the judge would chuck his pen in your eye.\"\n\n\"Would he now?\" said Joe, one of whose faults was that he took things literally. \"But perhaps if you took Billing out to dinner, Fred----\"\n\n\"He's a vegetarian, Joe\"--he reached in his turn for a cigar, snipped the end and lit it--\"and he's deaf. No, we've got to find a sucker, Joe. I can sell the _Fairy May_ and the _Fairy Belle_: they're little boats, and are worth money in the open market. I can sell the wharfage and offices and the goodwill----\"\n\n\"What's the goodwill worth, Fred?\"\n\n\"About fivepence net,\" said the gloomy Fred. \"I can sell all these, but it is the _Fairy Mary_ and the _Fairy Tilda_ that's breaking my heart. And yet, Joe, there ain't two ships of their tonnage to be bought on the market. If you wanted two ships of the same size and weight, you couldn't buy 'em for a million--no, you couldn't. I guess they must be bad ships, Joe.\"",
    "He waved Mr. Fred to a chair and wrote furiously. This frantic pressure of work was a phenomenon which invariably coincided with the arrival of a visitor. It was, I think, partly due to nervousness and partly to his dislike of strangers. Presently he finished, blotted the paper, stuck it in an envelope, addressed it, and placed it in his drawer. Then he took up the card.\n\n\"Mr. Pole?\" he said.\n\n\"Mr. Pole,\" repeated that gentleman.\n\n\"Mr. _Fred_ Pole?\" asked Bones, with an air of surprise.\n\n\"Mr. Fred Pole,\" admitted the other soberly.\n\nBones looked from the card to the visitor as though he could not believe his eyes.\n\n\"We have a letter from you somewhere,\" he said, searching the desk. \"Ah, here it is!\" (It was, in fact, the only document on the table.) \"Yes, yes, to be sure. I'm very glad to meet you.\"\n\nHe rose, solemnly shook hands, sat down again and coughed. Then he took up the ivory paper-knife to chew, coughed again as he detected the lapse, and put it down with a bang.\n\n\"I thought I'd like to come along and see you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred in his gentle voice; \"we are so to speak, associated in business.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Bones. \"In-deed?\"\n\n\"You see, Mr. Tibbetts,\" Fred went on, with a sad smile, \"your lamented uncle, before he went out of business, sold us his ships. He died a month later.\"\n\nHe sighed and Bones sighed.\n\n\"Your uncle was a great man, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, \"one of the greatest business men in this little city. What a man!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Bones, shaking his head mournfully.\n\nHe had never met his uncle and had seldom heard of him. Saul Tibbetts was reputedly a miser, and his language was of such violence that the infant Augustus was invariably hurried to the nursery on such rare occasions as old Saul paid a family visit. His inheritance had come to Bones as in a dream, from the unreality of which he had not yet awakened.\n\n\"I must confess, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Fred, \"that I have often had qualms of conscience about your uncle, and I have been on the point of coming round to see you several times. This morning I said to my brother, 'Joe,' I said, 'I'm going round to see Tibbetts.' Forgive the familiarity, but we talk of firms like the Rothschilds and the Morgans without any formality.\"\n\n\"Naturally, naturally, naturally,\" murmured Bones gruffly.\n\n\"I said: 'I'll go and see Tibbetts and get it off my chest. If he wants those ships back at the price we paid for them, or even less, he shall have them.' 'Fred,' he said, 'you're too sensitive for business.' 'Joe,' I said, 'my conscience works even in business hours.'\"\n\nA light dawned on Bones and he brightened visibly.\n\n\"Ah, yes, my dear old Pole,\" he said almost cheerily, \"I understand. You diddled my dear old uncle--bless his heart--out of money, and you want to pay it back. Fred\"--Bones rose and extended his knuckly hand--\"you're a jolly old sportsman, and you can put it there!\"\n\n\"What I was going to say----\" began Fred seriously agitated.\n\n\"Not a word. We'll have a bottle on this. What will you have--ginger-beer or cider?\"\n\nMr. Fred suppressed a shudder with difficulty.\n\n\"Wait, wait, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he begged; \"I think I ought to explain. We did not, of course, knowingly rob your uncle----\"\n\n\"No, no, naturally,\" said Bones, with a facial contortion which passed for a wink. \"Certainly not. We business men never rob anybody. Ali, bring the drinks!\"\n\n\"We did not consciously rob him,\" continued Mr. Fred desperately, \"but what we did do---- ah, this is my confession!\"\n\n\"You borrowed a bit and didn't pay it back. Ah, naughty!\" said Bones. \"Out with the corkscrew, Ali. What shall it be--a cream soda or non-alcoholic ale?\"\n\nMr. Fred looked long and earnestly at the young man.\n\n\"Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said, and suddenly grasped the hand of Bones, \"I hope we are going to be friends. I like you. That's my peculiarity--I like people or I dislike them. Now that I've told you that we bought two ships from your uncle for one hundred and forty thousand pounds when we knew--yes, positively knew--they were worth at least twenty thousand pounds more--now I've told you this, I feel happier.\"\n\n\"Worth twenty thousand pounds more?\" said Bones thoughtfully. Providence was working overtime for him, he thought.\n\n\"Of anybody's money,\" said Fred stoutly. \"I don't care where you go, my dear chap. Ask Cole--he's the biggest shipping lawyer in this city--ask my brother, who, I suppose, is the greatest shipping authority in the world, or--what's the use of asking 'em?--ask yourself. If you're not Saul Tibbetts all over again, if you haven't the instinct and the eye and the brain of a shipowner--why, I'm a Dutchman! That's what I am--a Dutchman!\"\n\nHe picked up his hat and his lips were pressed tight--a gesture and a grimace which stood for grim conviction.\n\n\"What are they worth to-day?\" asked Bones, after a pause.\n\n\"What are they worth to-day?\" Mr. Fred frowned heavily at the ceiling. \"Now, what are they worth to-day? I forget how much I've spent on 'em--they're in dock now.\"\n\nBones tightened _his_ lips, too.\n\n\"They're in dock now?\" he said. He scratched his nose. \"Dear old Fred Pole,\" he said, \"you're a jolly old soul. By Jove that's not bad! 'Pole' an' 'soul' rhyme--did you notice it?\"\n\nFred had noticed it.\n\n\"It's rum,\" said Bones, shaking his head, \"it is rum how things get about. How did you know, old fellow-citizen, that I was going in for shippin'?\"",
    "Bones started violently.\n\n\"Excuse me, old speaker, I was thinking of something else. Do you mind saying that all over again?\"\n\nHonest John Staines swallowed something and repeated his proposition.\n\nBones shook his head violently.\n\n\"Nothing doing!\" he said. \"Wharves and ships--_no!_\"\n\nBut Honest John was not the kind that accepts refusal without protest.\n\n\"What I'll do,\" said he confidentially, \"is this: I'll leave the matter for twenty-four hours in your hands.\"\n\n\"No, go, my reliable old wharf-seller,\" said Bones. \"I never go up the river under any possible circumstances---- By Jove, I've got an idea!\"\n\nHe brought his knuckly fist down upon the unoffending desk, and Honest John watched hopefully.\n\n\"Now, if--yes, it's an idea!\"\n\nBones seized paper, and his long-feathered quill squeaked violently.\n\n\"That's it--a thousand members at ten pounds a year, four hundred bedrooms at, say, ten shillings a night---- How many is four hundred times ten shillings multiplied by three hundred and sixty-five? Well, let's say twenty thousand pounds. That's it! A club!\"\n\n\"A club?\" said Honest John blankly.\n\n\"A river club. You said Greenhithe--that's somewhere near Henley, isn't it?\"\n\nHonest John sighed.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he said gently, \"it's in the other direction--toward the sea.\"\n\nBones dropped his pen and pinched his lip in an effort of memory.\n\n\"Is it? Now, where was I thinking about? I know--Maidenhead! Is it near Maidenhead?\"\n\n\"It's in the opposite direction from London,\" said the perspiring Mr. Staines.\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\nBones's interest evaporated.\n\n\"No good to me, my old speculator. Wharves! Bah!\"\n\nHe shook his head violently, and Mr. Staines aroused himself.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said simply; \"I'll leave the plans with you. I'm going down into the country for a night. Think it over. I'll call to-morrow afternoon.\"\n\nBones still shook his head.\n\n\"No go, nothin' doin'. Finish this palaver, dear old Honesty!\"\n\n\"Anyway, no harm is done,\" urged Mr. Staines. \"I ask you, is there any harm done? You have the option for twenty-four hours. I'll roll the plans up so that they won't be in the way. Good morning!\"\n\nHe was out of the office door before Bones could as much as deliver the preamble to the stern refusal he was preparing.\n\nAt three o'clock that afternoon came two visitors. They sent in a card bearing the name of a very important Woking firm of land agents, and they themselves were not without dignity of bearing.\n\nThere was a stout gentleman and a thin gentleman, and they tiptoed into the presence of Bones with a hint of reverence which was not displeasing.\n\n\"We have come on a rather important matter,\" said the thin gentleman. \"We understand you have this day purchased Stivvins' Wharf----\"\n\n\"Staines had no right to sell it?\" burst in the stout man explosively. \"A dirty mean trick, after all that he promised us! It is just his way of getting revenge, selling the property to a stranger!\"\n\n\"Mr. Sole\"--the thin gentleman's voice and attitude were eloquent of reproof--\"_please_ restrain yourself! My partner is annoyed,\" he explained \"and not without reason. We offered fifty thousand pounds for Stivvins', and Staines, in sheer malice, has sold the property--which is virtually necessary to our client--literally behind our backs. Now, Mr. Tibbetts, are you prepared to make a little profit and transfer the property to us?\"\n\n\"But----\" began Bones.\n\n\"We will give you sixty thousand,\" said the explosive man. \"Take it or leave it--sixty thousand.\"\n\n\"But, my dear old Boniface,\" protested Bones, \"I haven't bought the property--really and truly I haven't. Jolly old Staines wanted me to buy it, but I assure you I didn't.\"\n\nThe stout man looked at him with glazed eyes, pulled himself together, and suggested huskily:\n\n\"Perhaps you will buy it--at his price--and transfer it to us?\"\n\n\"But why? Nothing to do with me, my old estate agent and auctioneer. Buy it yourself. Good afternoon. _Good_ afternoon!\"\n\nHe ushered them out in a cloud of genial commonplaces.\n\nIn the street they looked at one another, and then beckoned Mr. Staines, who was waiting on the other side of the road.\n\n\"This fellow is either as wide as Broad Street or he's a babe in arms,\" said the explosive man huskily.\n\n\"Didn't he fall?\" asked the anxious Staines.\n\n\"Not noticeably,\" said the thin man. \"This is your scheme, Jack, and if I've dropped four thousand over that wharf, there's going to be trouble.\"",
    "Mr. Charles O. Soames, who sat at a littered table in his shirt-sleeves, was a man with a big shock of hair and large and heavily drooping moustache, and a black chin. He smoked a big, heavy pipe, and, at the moment Bones was announced, his busy pencil was calling into life a new company offering the most amazing prospects to the young and wealthy. He took the card from the hands of his very plain typist, and suppressed the howl of joy which rose to his throat. For the name of Bones was known in the City of London, and it was the dream of such men as Charles O. Soames that one day they would walk from the office of Mr. Augustus Tibbetts with large parcels of his paper currency under each arm. He jumped up from his chair and slipped on a coat, pushed the prospectus he was writing under a heap of documents--one at least of which bore a striking family likeness to a county court writ--and welcomed his visitor decorously and even profoundly.\n\n\"In _re_ Plover Car,\" said Bones briskly. He prided himself upon coming to the point with the least possible delay.\n\nThe face of Mr. Soames fell.\n\n\"Oh, you want to buy a car?\" he said. He might have truly said \"the car,\" but under the circumstances he thought that this would be tactless.\n\n\"No, dear old company promoter,\" said Bones, \"I do not want to buy your car. In fact, you have no cars to sell.\"\n\n\"We've had a lot of labour trouble,\" said Mr. Soames hurriedly. \"You've no idea of the difficulties in production--what with the Government holding up supplies--but in a few months----\"\n\n\"I know all about that,\" said Bones. \"Now, I'm a man of affairs and a man of business.\" He said this so definitely that it sounded like a threat. \"I'm putting it to you, as one City of London business person to another City of London business person, is it possible to make cars at your factory?\"\n\nMr. Soames rose to the occasion.\n\n\"I assure you, Mr. Tibbetts,\" he said earnestly, \"it is possible. It wants a little more capital than we've been able to raise.\" This was the trouble with all Mr. Soames's companies, a long list of which appeared on a brass plate by the side of his door. None of them were sufficiently capitalised to do anything except to supply him with his fees as managing director.\n\nBones produced a dinky little pocket-book from his waistcoat and read his notes, or, rather, attempted to read his notes. Presently he gave it up and trusted to his memory.\n\n\"You've got forty thousand pounds subscribed to your Company,\" he said. \"Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do--I will take over your shares at a price.\"\n\nMr. Soames swallowed hard. Here was one of the dreams of his life coming true.\n\n\"There are four million shares issued,\" Bones went on, consulting his notebook.\n\n\"Eh?\" said Mr. Soames in a shocked voice.\n\nBones looked at his book closer.\n\n\"Is it four hundred thousand?\"\n\n\"Forty thousand,\" said Mr. Soames gently.\n\n\"It is a matter of indifference,\" said Bones. \"The point is, will you sell?\"\n\nThe managing director of the Plover Light Car Company pursed his lips.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"the shares are at a premium--not,\" he added quickly, \"that they are being dealt with on 'Change. We have not troubled to apply for quotations. But I assure you, my dear sir, the shares are at a premium.\"\n\nBones said nothing.\n\n\"At a small premium,\" said Mr. Soames hopefully.\n\nBones made no reply.\n\n\"At a half a crown premium,\" said Mr. Soames pleadingly.\n\n\"At par,\" said Bones, in his firmest and most business-like tones.\n\nThe matter was not settled there and then, because matters are not settled with such haste in the City of London. Bones went home to his office with a new set of notes, and wired to Hamilton, asking him to come on the following day. It was a great scheme that Bones worked out that night, with the aid of the sceptical Miss Whitland. His desk was piled high with technical publications dealing with the motor-car industry. The fact that he was buying the Company in order to rescue a friend's investment passed entirely from his mind in the splendid dream he conjured from his dubious calculations. The Plover car should cover the face of the earth. He read an article on mass production, showing how a celebrated American produced a thousand or a hundred thousand cars a day--he wasn't certain which--and how the car, in various parts, passed along an endless table, between lines of expectant workmen, each of whom fixed a nut or unfixed a nut, so that, when the machine finally reached its journey's end, it left the table under its own power. Bones designed a circular table, so that, if any of the workmen forgot to fix a bar or a nut or a wheel, the error could be rectified when the car came round again. The Plover car should be a household word. Its factories should spread over North London, and every year there should be a dinner with Bones in the chair, and a beautiful secretary on his right, and Bones should make speeches announcing the amount of the profits which were to be distributed to his thousands of hands in the shape of bonuses.\n\nHamilton came promptly at ten o'clock, and he came violently. He flew into the office and banged a paper down on Bones's desk with the enthusiasm of one who had become the sudden possessor of money which he had not earned.\n\n\"Dear old thing, dear old thing,\" said Bones testily, \"remember dear old Dicky Orum--preserve the decencies, dear old Ham. You're not in the Wild West now, my cheery boy.\"\n\n\"Bones,\" shouted Hamilton, \"you're my mascot! Do you know what has happened?\"\n\n\"Lower your voice, lower your voice, dear old friend,\" protested Bones. \"My typewriter mustn't think I am quarrelling.\"\n\n\"He came last night,\" said Hamilton, \"just as I was going to bed, and knocked me up.\" He was almost incoherent in his joy. \"He offered me three thousand five hundred pounds for my shares, and I took it like a shot.\"\n\nBones gaped at him.\n\n\"Offered you three thousand five hundred?\" he gasped. \"Good heavens! You don't mean to say----\"\n\nConsider the tragedy of that moment. Here was Bones, full of great schemes for establishing a car upon the world's markets, who had in his head planned extensive works, who saw in his mind's eye vistas of long, white-covered festive boards, and heard the roar of cheering which greeted him when he rose to propose continued prosperity to the firm. Consider also that his cheque was on the table before him, already made out and signed. He was at that moment awaiting the arrival of Mr. Soames. And then to this picture, tangible or fanciful, add Mr. Charles O. Soames himself, ushered through the door of the outer office and standing as though stricken to stone at the sight of Bones and Hamilton in consultation.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Bones.\n\nMr. Soames uttered a strangled cry and strode to the centre of the room, his face working.\n\n\"So it was a ramp, was it?\" he said. \"A swindle, eh? You put this up to get your pal out of the cart?\"\n\n\"My dear old----\" began Bones in a shocked voice.\n\n\"I see how it was done. Well, you've had me for three thousand five hundred, and your pal's lucky. That's all I've got to say. It is the first time I've ever been caught; and to be caught by a mug like you----\"\n\n\"Dear old thing, moderate your language,\" murmured Bones.\n\nMr. Soames breathed heavily through his nose, thrust his hat on the back of his head, and, without another word, strode from the office, and they heard the door slam behind him. Bones and Hamilton exchanged glances; then Bones picked up the cheque from the desk and slowly tore it up. He seemed to spend his life tearing up expensive cheques.\n\n\"What is it, Bones? What the dickens did you do?\" asked the puzzled Hamilton.\n\n\"Dear old Ham,\" said Bones solemnly, \"it was a little scheme--just a little scheme. Sit down, dear old officer,\" he said, after a solemn pause. \"And let this be a warning to you. Don't put your money in industries, dear old Captain Hamilton. What with the state of the labour market, and the deuced ingratitude of the working classes, it's positively heartbreaking--it is, indeed, dear old Ham.\"",
    "Bones explained. He had seen the derelict cinema company advertised in a technical journal, had been impressed with the amount of the impedimenta which accompanied the proprietorship of the syndicate, had been seized with a brilliant idea, bought the property, lock, stock, and barrel, for two thousand pounds, for which sum, as an act of grace, the late proprietors allowed him to take over the contract of Mr. Lew Becksteine, that amiable and gifted producer. It may be remarked, in passing, that this arrangement was immensely satisfactory to the syndicate, which was so tied and bound to Mr. Becksteine for the next twelve months that to have cancelled his contract would have cost them the greater part of the purchase price which Bones paid.\n\n\"This is the story,\" said Bones impressively. \"And, partner Ham, believe me, I've read many, many stories in my life, but never, never has one touched me as this has. It's a jolly old tear-bringer, Ham. Even a hardened, wicked old dev--old bird like you would positively dissolve. You would really, dear old Ham, so don't deny it. You know you've got one of the tenderest hearts in the world, you rascal!\"\n\nHe got up and shook hands with Hamilton, though there was no necessity for him to move.\n\n\"Now, clever old Becksteine thinks that this is going to be a scorcher.\"\n\n\"A winner, a winner,\" murmured Mr. Becksteine, closing his eyes and shaking his head. He spoke on this occasion very softly, but he could raise his voice to thrilling heights. \"A sure winner, my dear sir. I have been in the profession for twenty-seven years, and never in my life have I read a drama which contains so much heart appeal----\"\n\n\"You hear?\" said Bones in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\"--so much genuine comedy----\"\n\nBones nodded.\n\n\"--so much that I might say goes straight to the passionate heart of the great public, as this remarkable, brilliantly planned, admirably planted, exquisitely balanced little cameo of real life.\"\n\n\"It's to be a two-roller,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Reeler,\" murmured Mr. Becksteine.\n\n\"Reeler or roller, dear old thing; don't let's quarrel over how a thing's spelt,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Who wrote it?\" asked Hamilton.\n\nMr. Becksteine coughed modestly.\n\n\"Jolly old Becksteine wrote it,\" said Bones. \"That man, Ham, is one of the most brilliant geniuses in this or any other world. Aren't you? Speak up, old playwright. Don't be shy, old thing.\"\n\nMr. Becksteine coughed again.\n\n\"I do not know anything about other worlds,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Now, this is my idea,\" said Bones, interrupting what promised to be a free and frank admission of Mr. Becksteine's genius. \"I've worked the thing out, and I see just how we can save money. In producing two-roller cinematographs--that's the technical term,\" explained Bones, \"the heavy expense is with the artistes. The salaries that these people are paid! My dear old Ham, you'd never believe.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you can avoid paying salaries,\" said Hamilton patiently. \"I suppose even actors have to live.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Becksteine, shaking his head.\n\n\"Of course, dear old thing. But why pay outside actors?\" said Bones triumphantly. He glared from one face to the other with a ferocity of expression which did no more than indicate the strength of his conviction. \"Why not keep the money in the family, dear old Ham? That's what I ask you. Answer me that.\" He leaned back in his chair, thrust his hands in his trousers pockets, and blandly surveyed his discomfited audience.\n\n\"But you've got to have actors, my dear chap,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Naturally and necessarily,\" replied Bones, nodding with very large nods. \"And we have them. Who is Jasper Brown, the villain who tries to rob the poor girl of her legacy and casts the vilest aspersions upon her jolly old name?\"\n\n\"Who is?\" asked the innocent Hamilton.\n\n\"You are,\" said Bones.\n\nHamilton gasped.\n\n\"Who is Frank Fearnot, the young and handsome soldier--well, not necessarily handsome, but pretty good-looking--who rescues the girl from her sad predicament?\"\n\n\"Well, that can't be me, anyway,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"It is not,\" said Bones. \"It is me! Who is the gorgeous but sad old innocent one who's chased by you, Ham, till the poor little soul doesn't know which way to turn, until this jolly young officer steps brightly on the scene, whistling a merry tune, and, throwing his arms about her, saves her, dear old thing, from her fate--or, really, from a perfectly awful rotten time.\"\n\n\"Who is she?\" asked Hamilton softly.\n\nBones blinked and turned to the girl slowly.\n\n\"My dear old miss,\" he said, \"what do you think?\"\n\n\"What do I think?\" asked the startled girl. \"What do I think about what?\"\n\n\"There's a part,\" said Bones--\"there's one of the grandest parts that was ever written since Shakespeare shut his little copybook.\"\n\n\"You're not suggesting that I should play it?\" she asked, open-mouthed.\n\n\"Made for you, dear old typewriter, positively made for you, that part,\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"Of course I shall do nothing so silly,\" said the girl, with a laugh. \"Oh, Mr. Tibbetts, you really didn't think that I'd do such a----\"\n\nShe didn't finish the sentence, but Hamilton could have supplied the three missing words without any difficulty. Thereafter followed a discussion, which in the main consisted of joint and several rejection of parts. Marguerite Whitland most resolutely refused to play the part of the bad girl, even though Bones promised to change the title to \"The Good Girl,\" even though he wheedled his best, even though he struck attitudes indicative of despair and utter ruin, even though the gentle persuasiveness of Mr. Lew Becksteine was added to his entreaties. And Hamilton as resolutely declined to have anything to do with the bad man. Mr. Becksteine solved the difficulty by undertaking to produce the necessary actors and actresses at the minimum of cost.\n\n\"Of course you won't play, Bones?\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Bones. \"I'm not so sure, dear old thing. I've got a lot of acting talent in me, and I feel the part--that's a technical term you won't understand.\"\n\n\"But surely, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the girl reproachfully, \"you won't allow yourself to be photographed embracing a perfectly strange lady?\"\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Art, my dear old typewriter,\" he said. \"She'll be no more to me than a bit of wood, dear old miss. I shall embrace her and forget all about it the second after. You need have no cause for apprehension, really and truly.\"\n\n\"I am not at all apprehensive,\" said the girl coldly, and Bones followed her to her office, showering explanations of his meaning over her shoulder.",
    "Bones waited.\n\n\"I've heard it said, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said the young man--\"at least, it has been represented to me--that you are on the look-out for likely businesses that show a profit.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed Bones; \"that show me a big profit,\" he added.\n\n\"Well, Siker's Detective Agency has made two thousand a year clear for twenty years,\" said the young man. \"We've got one of the best lists of clients in the kingdom, and almost every big business man in the City is on our list. With a little more attention than my father has been able to give to it for the last two years, there's a fortune in it.\"\n\nBones was sitting upright now, his eyes shining. The amazing possibilities of such an acquisition were visible to his romantic eye.\n\n\"You want to sell it, my poor old Sherlock?\" he demanded, then, remembering the part he was called upon to play, shook his head. \"No, no, old thing. Deeply sorry and all that sort of thing, but it can't be done. It's not my line of business at all--not,\" he added, \"that I don't know a jolly sight more about detectivising than a good many of these clever ones. But it's really not my game. What did you want for it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the young man, hesitating, \"I thought that three years' purchase would be a bargain for the man who bought it.\"\n\n\"Six thousand pounds,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed the other. \"Of course, I won't ask you to buy the thing blindfolded. You can put the accounts in the hands of your lawyer or your accountant, and you will find that what I have said is true--that my father took two thousand a year out of his business for years. It's possible to make it four thousand. And as to running it, there are three men who do all the work--or, rather, one, Hilton, who's in charge of the office and gives the other fellows their instructions.\"\n\n\"But why sell it, my sad old improvidence?\" said Bones. \"Why chuck away two thousand a year for six thousand cash?\"\n\n\"Because I'm not well enough to carry it on,\" said young Mr. Siker, after a moment's hesitation. \"And, besides, I can't be bothered. It interferes with my other profession--I'm a musician.\"\n\n\"And a jolly good profession, too,\" said Bones, shaking hands with him across the table. \"I'll sleep on this. Give me your address and the address of your accountants, and I'll come over and see you in the morning.\"\n\nHamilton was at his desk the next morning at ten o'clock. Bones did not arrive until eleven, and Bones was monstrously preoccupied. When Hamilton saluted him with a cheery \"Good morning,\" Bones returned a grave and non-committal nod. Hamilton went on with his work until he became conscious that somebody was staring at him, and, looking up, caught Bones in the act.\n\n\"What the devil are you looking at?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"At your boots,\" was the surprising reply.\n\n\"My boots?\" Hamilton pulled them back through the kneehole of the desk and looked at them. \"What's the matter with the boots?\"\n\n\"Mud-stains, old carelessness,\" said Bones tersely. \"You've come from Twickenham this morning.\"\n\n\"Of course I've come from Twickenham. That's where I live,\" said Hamilton innocently. \"I thought you knew that.\"\n\n\"I should have known it,\" said Bones, with great gravity, \"even if I hadn't known it, so to speak. You may have observed, my dear Hamilton, that the jolly old mud of London differs widely--that is to say, is remarkably different. For instance, the mud of Twickenham is different from the mud of Balham. There's what you might call a subtle difference, dear junior partner, which an unimaginative old rascal like you wouldn't notice. Now, the mud of Peckham,\" said Bones, waving his forefinger, \"is distinguished by a certain darkness----\"\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" said Hamilton. \"Have you bought a mud business or something?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bones.\n\n\"And yet this conversation seems familiar to me,\" mused Hamilton. \"Proceed with your argument, good gossip.\"\n\n\"My argument,\" said Bones, \"is that you have Twickenham mud on your boots, therefore you come from Twickenham. It is evident that on your way to the station you stopped to buy a newspaper, that something was on your mind, something mad\"",
    "Bones went to the office of Siker's Detective Agency early the next morning. He went, it may be remarked in passing, though these details can only be interesting to the psychologist, wearing the darkest of his dark suits and a large black wideawake hat. There was a certain furtiveness in his movements between the taxicab and the entrance of the office, which might suggest to anybody who had taken the trouble to observe him that he was an escaping bank-robber. Siker's had spacious offices and a small staff. Only Hilton, the manager, and a clerk were in when Bones presented his card. He was immediately conducted by Mr. Hilton to a very plain inner office, surrounded with narrow shelves, which in turn were occupied by innumerable little deed boxes. Mr. Hilton was a sober-faced man of fifty-five, sallow and unhappy. His tone was funereal and deliberate, his eyes steady and remorseless.\n\n\"Sit down, Mr. Senob,\" he said hollowly. \"I have a message from the lawyers, and I presume I am welcoming to this establishment the new proprietor who has taken the place of my revered chief, whom I have faithfully served for twenty-nine years.\"\n\nBones closed his eyes and listened as to an address of welcome.\n\n\"Personally,\" said Mr. Hilton, \"I think that the sale of this business is a great mistake on the part of the Siker family. The Sikers have been detectives for four generations,\" he said with a relish of an antiquarian. \"George Siker first started work as an investigator in 1814 in this identical building. For thirty-five years he conducted Siker's Confidential Bureau, and was succeeded by his son James the grandfather of the late John George for twenty-three years----\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" said Bones. \"Poor old George! Well, well, we can't live for ever, dear old chief of staff. Now, the thing is, how to improve this jolly old business.\"\n\nHe looked around the dingy apartment without enthusiasm.\n\nBones had visitors that morning, many visitors. They were not, as he had anticipated, veiled ladies or cloaked dukes, nor did they pour into his discreet ears the stories of misspent lives. There was Mr. Carlo Borker, of Borker's Confidential Enquiry Bureau, a gross man in a top hat, who complained bitterly that old man Siker had practically and to all intents and purposes offered him an option of the business years ago. It was a one-sided conversation.\n\n\"I says to him: 'Siker, if you ever want to sell out' ... He says to me: 'Borker, my boy, you've only to offer me a reasonable figure' ... I says to him: 'Now, Siker, don't ever let anybody else get this business....'\"\n\nThen there was ex-Inspector Stellingworth, of Stellingworth's Detective Corps, a gloomy man, who painted in the blackest colours the difficulties and tragedies of private investigation, yet seemed willing enough to assume the burden of Siker's Agency, and give Bones a thousand pounds profit on his transaction.\n\nMr. Augustus Tibbetts spent three deliciously happy days in reorganising the business. He purchased from the local gunsmith a number of handcuffs, which were festooned upon the wall behind his desk and secured secretly--since he did not think that the melancholy Mr. Hilton would approve--a large cardboard box filled to the brim with adjustable beards of every conceivable hue, from bright scarlet to mouse colour. He found time to relate to a sceptical Hamilton something of his achievements.\n\n\"Wonderful case to-day, dear old boy,\" he said enthusiastically on the third evening. \"A naughty old lady has been flirting with a very, very naughty old officer. Husband tremendously annoyed. How that man loves that woman!\"\n\n\"Which man?\" said Hamilton cynically.\n\n\"I refer to my client,\" said Bones not without dignity.\n\n\"Look here, Bones,\" said Hamilton with great seriousness, \"do you think this is a very nice business you are in? Personally, I think it's immoral.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--immoral?\" demanded the indignant Bones.\n\n\"Prying into other people's lives,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Lives,\" retorted the oracular Bones, \"are meant to be pried into, dear old thing. An examination of jolly old motives is essential to scientific progress. I feel I am doing a public duty,\" he went on virtuously, \"exposing the naughty, chastising the sinful, and all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"But, honestly,\" said Hamilton persistently, \"do you think it's the game to chase around collecting purely private details about people's goings on?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Bones firmly, \"certainly, dear old thing. It's a public duty. Never let it be written on the fair pages of Thiggumy that a Tibbetts shrank back when the call of patriotism--all that sort of thing--you know what I mean?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Well, you're a jolly old dense one,\" said Bones. \"And let me say here and now\"--he rammed his bony knuckles on the table and withdrew them with an \"Ouch!\" to suck away the pain--\"let me tell you that, as the Latin poet said, '_Ad What's-his name, ad Thiggumy_.' 'Everything human's frightfully interesting'!\"\n\nBones turned up at his detective office the next morning, full of zeal, and Hilton immediately joined him in his private office.\n\n\"Well, we finish one case to-day, I think,\" said Hilton with satisfaction. \"It has been very hard trailing him, but I got a good man on the job, and here's the record.\"\n\nHe held in his hand a sheaf of papers.\n\n\"Very good,\" said Bones. \"Excellent! I hope we shall bring the malefactor to justice.\"\n\n\"He's not exactly a malefactor,\" demurred Hilton. \"It is a job we were doing for one of our best clients.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent!\" murmured Bones. \"And well we've done it, I'm sure.\" He leant back in his chair and half closed his eyes. \"Tell me what you have discovered.\"\n\n\"This man's a bit of a fool in some ways,\" said Hilton.\n\n\"Which man--the client?\"\n\n\"No, the fellow we've been trailing.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Bones. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"In fact, I wonder that Mr. de Vinne bothered about him.\"\n\n\"De Vinne?\" said Bones sitting up. \"Harold de Vinne, the moneyed one?\"\n\n\"That's him. He's one of our oldest customers,\" said Hilton.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Bones, this time without any enthusiasm at all.\n\n\"You see, a man did him in the eye,\" explained Mr. Hilton, \"swindled him, and all that sort of thing. Well, I think we have got enough to make this chap look silly.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Bones politely. \"What have you got?\"\n\n\"Well, it appears,\" said Hilton, \"that this chap is madly in love with his typist.\"\n\n\"Which chap?\" said Bones.\n\n\"The fellow who did Mr. de Vinne in the eye,\" replied the patient Mr. Hilton. \"He used to be an officer on the West Coast of Africa, and was known as Bones. His real name is Tibbetts.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Bones.\n\n\"Well, we've found out all about him,\" continued Hilton. \"He's got a flat in Jermyn Street, and this girl of his, this typist girl, dines with him. She's not a bad-looking girl, mind you.\"\n\nBones rose to his feet, and there was in his face a terrible look.\n\n\"Hilton,\" he said, \"do you mean that you have been shadowing a perfectly innocent man and a charming, lovely old typewriter, that couldn't say 'Goo' to a boose?\"\n\nBones was pardonably agitated.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that this office descends to this low practice of prying into the private lives of virtuous gentlemen and typewriters? Shame upon you, Hilton!\" His voice shook. \"Give me that report!\" He thrust the report into the fire. \"Now call up Mr. Borker, and tell him I want to see him on business, and don't disturb me, because I am writing a letter.\"\n\nHe pulled a sheet of paper from his stationery rack and wrote furiously. He hardly stopped to think, he scarcely stopped to spell. His letter was addressed to Mr. de Vinne, and when, on the following day, Mr. Borker took over the business of Siker's Agency, that eminent firm of investigators had one client the less.",
    "Bones had indeed moved into the intellectual atmosphere of Devonshire Street. He had hired a flat of great beauty and magnificence, with lofty rooms and distempered walls and marble chimney-pieces, for all the world like those rooms in the catalogues of furniture dealers which so admirably show off the fifty-pound drawing-room suite offered on the easiest terms.\n\n\"My dear old thing,\" he said, describing his new splendours to Hamilton, \"you ought to see the jolly old bathroom!\"\n\n\"What do you want a bath for?\" asked Hamilton innocently. \"You've only got the place for three years.\"\n\n\"Now, dear old thing, don't be humorous,\" said Bones severely. \"Don't be cheap, dear old comic one.\"\n\n\"The question is,\" said Hamilton, \"why the dickens do you want a new flat? Your old flat was quite a palatial establishment. Are you thinking of setting up housekeeping?\"\n\nBones turned very red. In his embarrassment he stood first upon one leg and then the other, lifting his eyebrows almost to the roof of his head to let in his monocle, and lifted them as violently to let it out again.\n\n\"Don't pry, don't pry, dear old Ham,\" he said testily. \"Great Heavens and Moses! Can't a fellow take a desirable flat, with all modern conveniences, in the most fashionable part of the West End, and all that sort of thing, without exciting the voice of scandal, dear old thing? I'm surprised at you, really I am, Ham. I am, Ham,\" he repeated. \"That sounds good,\" he said, brightening up. \"Am Ham!\"\n\n\"But what is the scheme?\" persisted Hamilton.\n\n\"A bargain, a bargain, dear old officer,\" said Bones, hurriedly, and proceeded to the next business.\n\nThat next business included the rejection of several very promising offers which had arrived from different directors of companies, and people. Bones was known as a financier. People who wanted other people to put money into things invariably left Bones to the last, because they liked trying the hard things first. The inventor and patentee of the reaping machine that could be worked by the farmer in his study, by means of push keys, was sure, sooner or later, to meet a man who scratched his chin and said:\n\n\"Hard luck, but why don't you try that man Tibbetts? He's got an office somewhere around. You'll find it in the telephone book. He's got more money than he knows what to do with, and your invention is the very thing he'd finance.\"\n\nAs a rule, it was the very thing that Bones did not finance.\n\nCompanies that required ten thousand pounds for the extension of their premises, and the fulfilment of the orders which were certain to come next year, drafted through their secretaries the most wonderful letters, offering Bones a seat on their board, or even two seats, in exchange for his autograph on the south-east corner of a cheque. These letters usually began somehow like this:\n\n\"At a moment when the eyes of the world are turned upon Great Britain, and when her commercial supremacy is threatened, it behoves us all to increase production....\" And usually there was some reference to \"the patriotic duty of capital.\"\n\nThere was a time when these appeals to his better nature would have moved Bones to amazing extravagance, but happily that time was before he had any money to speak about.\n\nFor Bones was growing in wisdom and in wiliness as the days passed. Going through the pile of correspondence, he came upon a letter which he read thoughtfully, and then read again before he reached to the telephone and called a number. In the City of London there was a business-like agency which supplied him with a great deal of useful information, and it was to these gentlemen that he addressed his query: \"Who are Messrs. Seepidge & Soomes?\"\n\nHe waited for some time with the receiver at his ear, a far-away look in his eyes, and then the reply came:\n\n\"A little firm of printers run by a rascal named Seepidge, who has been twice bankrupt and is now insolvent. His firm has been visited by the police for illegal printing several times, and the firm is in such a low condition that it has a job to pay its wages bill.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Bones. \"Thank you, dear old commercial guardian. What is the business worth?\"\n\n\"It's worth your while to keep away from it,\" said the humorous reply, and Bones hung up the receiver.\n\n\"Ham, old dear,\" he said, and Hamilton looked up. \"Suppose,\" said Bones, stretching out his legs and fixing his monocle, \"suppose, my jolly old accountant and partner, you were offered a business which was worth\"--he paused--\"which was worth your while keeping away from it--that's a pretty good line, don't you think, old literary critic?\"\n\n\"A very good line,\" said Hamilton calmly; \"but you have rather a loud-speaking telephone, and I think I have heard the phrase before.\"\n\n\"Oh, have you?\" said Bones by no means abashed. \"Still, it's a very good line. And suppose you were offered this printing business for fifteen thousand pounds, what would you say?\"\n\n\"It depends on who was present,\" said Ham, \"and where I was. For example, if I were in the gorgeous drawing-room of your wonderful flat, in the splendid presence of your lovely lady wife to be----\"\n\nBones rose and wagged his finger.\n\n\"Is nothing sacred to you, dear old Ham?\" he choked. \"Are the most tender emotions, dear old thing, which have ever been experienced by any human being----\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hamilton, \"and let's hear about this financial problem of yours.\"\n\nBones was ruffled, and blinked, and it was some time before he could bring himself back to sordid matters of business.\n\n\"Well, suppose this jolly old brigand offered you his perfectly beastly business for fifteen thousand pounds, what would you do?\"\n\n\"Send for the police,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Would you now?\" said Bones, as if the idea struck him for the first time. \"I never have sent for the police you know, and I've had simply terrible offers put up to me.\"\n\n\"Or put it in the waste-paper basket,\" said Hamilton, and then in surprise: \"Why the dickens are you asking all these questions?\"\n\n\"Why am I asking all these questions?\" repeated Bones. \"Because, old thing, I have a hump.\"\n\nHamilton raised incredulous eyebrows.\n\n\"I have what the Americans call a hump.\"\n\n\"A hump?\" said Hamilton, puzzled. \"Oh, you mean a 'hunch.'\"\n\n\"Hump or hunch, it's all the same,\" said Bones airily. \"But I've got it.\"\n\n\"What exactly is your hunch?\"\n\n\"There's something behind this,\" said Bones, tapping a finger solemnly on the desk. \"There's a scheme behind this--there's a swindle--there's a ramp. Nobody imagines for one moment that a man of my reputation could be taken in by a barefaced swindle of this character. I think I have established in the City of London something of a tradition,\" he said.\n\n\"You have,\" agreed Hamilton. \"You're supposed to be the luckiest devil that ever walked up Broad Street.\"\n\n\"I never walk up Broad Street, anyway,\" said Bones, annoyed. \"It is a detestable street, a naughty old street, and I should ride up it--or, at least, I shall in a day or two.\"\n\n\"Buying a car?\" asked Hamilton, interested.\n\n\"I'll tell you about that later,\" said Bones evasively, and went on: \"Now, putting two and two together, you know the conclusion I've reached?\"\n\n\"Four?\" suggested Hamilton.\n\nBones, with a shrug ended the conversation then and there, and carried his correspondence to the outer office, knocking, as was his wont, until his stenographer gave him permission to enter.",
    "\"Have you seen her?\" asked Bones.\n\nHe put this question with such laboured unconcern that Hamilton put down his pen and glared suspiciously at his partner.\n\n\"She's rather a beauty,\" Bones went on, toying with his ivory paper-knife. \"She has one of those dinky bonnets, dear old thing, that makes you feel awfully braced with life.\"\n\nHamilton gasped. He had seen the beautiful Miss Whitland enter the office half an hour before, but he had not noticed her head-dress.\n\n\"Her body's dark blue, with teeny red stripes,\" said Bones dreamily, \"and all her fittings are nickel-plated----\"\n\n\"Stop!\" commanded Hamilton hollowly. \"To what unhappy woman are you referring in this ribald fashion?\"\n\n\"Woman!\" spluttered the indignant Bones. \"I'm talking about my car.\"\n\n\"Your car?\"\n\n\"My car,\" said Bones, in the off-handed way that a sudden millionaire might refer to \"my earth.\"\n\n\"You've bought a car?\"\n\nBones nodded.\n\n\"It's a jolly good 'bus,\" he said. \"I thought of running down to Brighton on Sunday.\"\n\nHamilton got up and walked slowly across the room with his hands in his pockets.\n\n\"You're thinking of running down to Brighton, are you?\" he said. \"Is it one of those kind of cars where you have to do your own running?\"\n\nBones, with a good-natured smile, also rose from his desk and walked to the window.\n\n\"My car,\" he said, and waved his hand to the street.\n\nBy craning his neck, Hamilton was able to get a view of the patch of roadway immediately in front of the main entrance to the building. And undoubtedly there was a car in waiting--a long, resplendent machine that glittered in the morning sunlight.\n\n\"What's the pink cushion on the seat?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"That's not a pink cushion, dear old myoptic,\" said Bones calmly; \"that's my chauffeur--Ali ben Ahmed.\"\n\n\"Good lor!\" said the impressed Hamilton. \"You've a nerve to drive into the City with a sky-blue Kroo boy.\"\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"We attracted a certain amount of attention,\" he admitted, not without satisfaction.\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Hamilton, going back to his desk. \"People thought you were advertising Pill Pellets for Pale Poultry. When did you buy this infernal machine?\"\n\nBones, at his desk, crossed his legs and put his fingers together.\n\n\"Negotiations, dear old Ham, have been in progress for a month,\" he recited. \"I have been taking lessons on the quiet, and to-day--proof!\" He took out his pocket-book and threw a paper with a lordly air towards his partner. It fell half-way on the floor.\n\n\"Don't trouble to get up,\" said Hamilton. \"It's your motor licence. You needn't be able to drive a car to get that.\"\n\nAnd then Bones dropped his attitude of insouciance and became a vociferous advertisement for the six-cylinder Carter-Crispley (\"the big car that's made like a clock\"). He became double pages with illustrations and handbooks and electric signs. He spoke of Carter and of Crispley individually and collectively with enthusiasm, affection, and reverence.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Hamilton, when he had finished. \"It sounds good.\"\n\n\"Sounds good!\" scoffed Bones. \"Dear old sceptical one, that car...\"\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nAll excesses being their own punishment, two days later Bones renewed an undesirable acquaintance. In the early days of Schemes, Ltd., Mr. Augustus Tibbetts had purchased a small weekly newspaper called the _Flame_. Apart from the losses he incurred during its short career, the experience was made remarkable by the fact that he became acquainted with Mr. Jelf, a young and immensely self-satisfied man in pince-nez, who habitually spoke uncharitably of bishops, and never referred to members of the Government without causing sensitive people to shudder. The members of the Government retaliated by never speaking of Jelf at all, so there was probably some purely private feud between them. Jelf disapproved of everything. He was twenty-four years of age, and he, too, had made the acquaintance of the Hindenburg Line. Naturally Bones thought of Jelf when he purchased the _Flame_. From the first Bones had run the _Flame_ with the object of exposing things. He exposed Germans, Swedes, and Turks--which was safe. He exposed a furniture dealer who had made him pay twice for an article because a receipt was lost, and that cost money. He exposed a man who had been very rude to him in the City. He would have exposed James Jacobus Jelf, only that individual showed such eagerness to expose his own shortcomings, at a guinea a column, that Bones had lost interest. His stock of personal grievances being exhausted, he had gone in for a general line of exposure which embraced members of the aristocracy and the Stock Exchange. If Bones did not like a man's face, he exposed him. He had a column headed \"What I Want to Know,\" and signed \"Senob.\" in which such pertinent queries appeared as:\n\n\"When will the naughty old lord who owns a sky-blue motor-car, and wears pink spats, realise that his treatment of his tenants is a disgrace to his ancient lineage?\"\n\nThis was one of James Jacobus Jelf's contributed efforts. It happened on this particular occasion that there was only one lord in England who owned a sky-blue car and blush-rose spats, and it cost Bones two hundred pounds to settle his lordship. Soon after this, Bones disposed of the paper, and instructed Mr. Jelf not to call again unless he called in an ambulance--an instruction which afterwards filled him with apprehension, since he knew that J. J. J. would charge up the ambulance to the office. Thus matters stood two days after his car had made its public appearance, and Bones sat confronting the busy pages of his garage bill. On this day he had had his lunch brought into the office, and he was in a maze of calculation, when there came a knock at the door.\n\n\"Come in!\" he yelled, and, as there was no answer, walked to the door and opened it.",
    "The Right Honourable Mr. Parkinson Chenney had concluded a very satisfactory morning's work of inspection at Tolness, and had secured all the information he needed to answer any question which might be put to him in Parliament by the best-informed of questioners. He was lunching with the officers of the small garrison, when a telephone message was brought to him. He read it and smiled.\n\n\"Good!\" he said. \"Gentlemen, I am afraid I have to leave you a little earlier than I expected. Colonel Wraggle, will you see that my special train is ready! I must leave in ten minutes. The Chinese Commission has arrived,\" he said impressively, \"or, rather, it arrives in London this afternoon, and I am deputed by the Prime Minister----\"\n\nHe explained to his respectful audience just what part he had played in securing Chinese Coal Concessions. He made a little speech on the immense value to the Empire in particular and the world in general of these new coalfields which had been secured to the country through the acumen, genius, forethought, and patriotic disinterestedness of the Cabinet.\n\nHe would not claim to set any particular merit on his own action, and went on to claim it. By which time his train was ready. It was indeed vital that he should be in London to meet a commission which had shown such reluctance to trade with foreign devils, and had been, moreover, so punctilious in its demand for ceremonious receptions, but he had not the slightest doubt about his ability to reach London before the boat train arrived. He had two and a half hours, and two and a half hours gave him an ample margin of time.\n\nJust before his special rounded the bend which brought it within sight of Bayham Junction the Lynhaven express had reached within a few hundred yards of annihilation. The signalman at Bayham Junction had watched the oncoming rush of Bones's train, and, having a fairly extensive knowledge of the \"Mary Louisa\" and her eccentricities, he realised just what had happened.\n\nThere was only one thing to be done. He could see the smoke from the Cabinet Minister's special rising above the cutting two miles away, and he threw over two levers simultaneously. The first set the points which brought the Lynhaven express on to the main line, switching it from the deadly bay wherein the runaway train would have been smashed to pieces; the second lever set the distant signal against the special. It was a toss-up whether the special had not already passed the distant signal, but he had to take that risk.\n\nBones, with his arm round the girl, awaiting a noisy and violent dissolution, felt the \"Mary Louisa\" sway to the right when it should have swayed to the left, heard the clang of the points as he passed them, and drew a long breath when he found himself headed along a straight clear stretch of line. It was some time before he found his voice, and then it was little more than a squeak.\n\n\"We're going to London, dear old thing,\" he said tremulously.\n\nThe girl smiled, though her face was deathly pale.\n\n\"I thought we were going to heaven,\" she said.\n\n\"Never, dear old thing,\" said Bones, recovering something of his spirits as he saw the danger past. \"Old Bones will never send you there.\"\n\nThe problem of the \"Mary Louisa\" was still unsettled. She was tearing away like a Flying Dutchman. She was oozing steam at every pore, and, glancing back, Bones saw the agitated countenance of the aged guard thrust through the window. He waved frantically at Bones, and Bones waved genially back again.\n\nHe was turning back to make another attempt on the lever, when, looking past the guard, he saw a sight which brought his heart into his mouth. Pounding along behind him, and emitting feathers of steam from her whistle, was an enormous locomotive. Bones guessed there was a train behind it, but the line was too straight for him to see.\n\n\"Gracious heavens!\" he gasped. \"We're being chased!\"\n\nHe jerked at the lever--though it was a moment when he should have left it severely alone--and to his ill-founded joy it moved.\n\nThe two trains came to a standstill together ten miles from Bayham Junction, and Bones climbed down into the six-foot way and walked back.\n\nAlmost the first person he met was a gesticulating gentleman in a frock coat and with a red face, who, mistaking him for an engine-driver, dismissed him on the spot, threatened him with imprisonment--with or without hard labour he did not specify--and demanded what the dickens he meant by holding up a Cabinet Minister?\n\n\"Why,\" chortled Bones, \"isn't it my dear friend, Mr. Chenney?\"\n\n\"Who are you,\" snarled Mr. Chenney, \"and what do you mean by calling me your dear friend? By Heavens, I'll have you kicked out of this service!\"\n\n\"Don't you know old Tibbetts?\" cooed Bones. \"Well, well, fancy meeting you!\"\n\nHe held out a grimy hand, which was not taken.\n\n\"Tibbetts!\" growled the gentleman. \"Oh, you are the foo--the gentleman who bought the Lynhaven line, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Bones.\n\n\"But what is your train doing here?\" asked Mr. Chenney violently. \"Don't you realise you are holding up a special? Great Heavens, man, this is very serious! You are holding up the business of the country!\"\n\nThe engine-driver of the special came to the rescue.\n\n\"There's a switch-over about half a mile further on,\" he said. \"There's not a down train due for an hour. I'll unlock the switch and put you on to the other line, and, after we have passed, you can come on.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to come on, dear old thing,\" said Bones. \"I want to go back.\"\n\n\"Well, that's simple,\" said the driver.",
    "Bones looked up from his desk as the debonair young man strolled in.\n\n\"You don't know me, Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Jackson Hyane, flashing his famous smile. \"My name is Hyane.\"\n\nIt was his first meeting with Bones, but by no means the first time that Jackson had seen him.\n\n\"My dear old Hyane, sit down,\" said Bones cheerfully. \"What can we do for you?\"\n\nMr. Hyane laughed.\n\n\"There's nothing you can do for me, except to spare your secretary for an hour longer than she usually takes.\"\n\n\"My secretary?\" said Bones quickly, and shot a suspicious glance at the visitor.\n\n\"I mean Miss Whitland,\" said Hyane easily. \"She is my cousin, you know. My mother's brother was her father.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Bones a little stiffly.\n\nHe felt a sense of the strongest resentment against the late Professor Whitland. He felt that Marguerite's father had played rather a low trick on him in having a sister at all, and Mr. Hyane was too keen a student to overlook Bones's obvious annoyance.\n\n\"Yes,\" he went on carelessly, \"we are quite old friends, Marguerite and I, and you can't imagine how pleased I am that she has such an excellent job as this.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Bones, clearing his throat. \"Very nice old--very good typewriter indeed, Mr. Hyane ... very nice person ... ahem!\"\n\nMarguerite, dressed for the street, came in from her office at that moment, and greeted her cousin with a little nod, which, to the distorted vision of Bones, conveyed the impression of a lifelong friendship.\n\n\"I have just been asking Mr. Tibbetts,\" said Hyane, \"if he could spare you for an extra hour.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that can't----\" the girl began.\n\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\" said Bones, raising his voice as he invariably did when he was agitated. \"Certainly, my dear old--er--my dear young--er--certainly, Miss Marguerite, by all means, take your cousin to the Zoo ... I mean show him the sights.\"\n\nHe was patently agitated, and watched the door close on the two young people with so ferocious a countenance that Hamilton, a silent observer of the scene, could have laughed.\n\nBones walked slowly back to his desk as Hamilton reached for his hat.\n\n\"Come on, Bones,\" he said briskly. \"It's lunch time. I had no idea it was so late.\"\n\nBut Bones shook his head.\n\n\"No, thank you, dear old thing,\" he said sadly. \"I'd rather not, if you don't mind.\"\n\n\"Aren't you coming to lunch?\" asked Hamilton, astonished.\n\nBones shook his head.\n\n\"No, dear old boy,\" he said hollowly. \"Ask the girl to send me up a stiff glass of soda-water and a biscuit--I don't suppose I shall eat the biscuit.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Hamilton. \"Half an hour ago you were telling me you could eat a cart-horse.\"\n\n\"Not now, old Ham,\" said Bones. \"If you've ordered it, send it back. I hate cart-horses, anyway.\"\n\n\"Come along,\" wheedled Hamilton, dropping his hand on the other's shoulder. \"Come and eat. Who was the beautiful boy?\"\n\n\"Beautiful boy?\" laughed Bones bitterly. \"A fop, dear old Ham! A tailor's dummy! A jolly old clothes-horse--that's what he was. I simply loathe these people who leap around the City for a funeral. It's not right, dear old thing. It's not manly, dear old sport. What the devil did her father have a sister for? I never knew anything about it.\"\n\n\"They ought to have told you,\" said Hamilton sympathetically. \"Now come and have some food.\"\n\nBut Bones refused. He was adamant. He would sit there and starve. He did not say as much, but he hinted that, when Hamilton returned, his famished and lifeless form would be found lying limply across the desk. Hamilton went out to lunch alone, hurried through his meal, and came back to find Bones alive but unhappy.",
    "\"I'll think it over,\" he said. \"It appeals to me, old de Vinne. It really does appeal to me. Who own the shares?\"\n\n\"I can give you a list,\" said Mr. de Vinne, with admirable calm, \"and you'd be well advised to negotiate privately with these gentlemen. You'd probably get the shares for eighteen shillings.\" He took a gold pencil from his pocket and wrote rapidly a list of names, and Bones took the paper from his hand and scrutinised them.\n\nHamilton, a silent and an amazed spectator of the proceedings, waited until de Vinne had gone, and then fell upon his partner.\n\n\"You're not going to be such a perfect jackass----\" he began, but Bones's dignified gesture arrested his eloquence.\n\n\"Dear old Ham,\" he said, \"senior partner, dear old thing! Let old Bones have his joke.\"\n\n\"Do you realise,\" said Hamilton, \"that you are contemplating the risk of a quarter of a million? You're mad, Bones!\"\n\nBones grinned.\n\n\"Go down to our broker and buy ten thousand shares in old Mazeppa, Ham,\" he said. \"You'll buy them on the market for nineteen shillings, and I've an idea that they're worth about the nineteenth part of a farthing.\"\n\n\"But----\" stammered Hamilton.\n\n\"It is an order,\" said Bones, and he spoke in the Bomongo tongue.\n\n\"Phew!\" said Hamilton. \"That carries me a few thousand miles. I wonder what those devils of the N'gombi are doing now?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you something they're not doing,\" said Bones. \"They're not buying Mazeppa shares.\"\n\nThere were two very deeply troubled people in the office of Tibbetts and Hamilton. One was Hamilton himself, and the other was Miss Marguerite Whitland. Hamilton had two causes for worry. The first and the least was the strange extravagance of Bones. The second--and this was more serious--was the prospect of breaking to Sanders that night that he had been swindled, for swindled he undoubtedly was. Hamilton had spent a feverish hour canvassing City opinion on the Mazeppa Trading Company, and the report he had had was not encouraging. He had, much against his will, carried out the instructions of Bones, and had purchased in the open market ten thousand shares in the Company--a transaction duly noted by Mr. de Vinne and his interested partner.\n\n\"He is biting,\" said that exultant man over the 'phone. \"All we have to do is to sit steady, and he'll swallow the hook!\"\n\nIt was impossible that Marguerite Whitland should not know the extent of her employer's commitments. She was a shrewd girl, and had acquired a very fair working knowledge of City affairs during the period of her employment. She had, too, an instinct for a swindle, and she was panic-stricken at the thought that Bones was marching headlong to financial disaster. Hamilton had gone home to his disagreeable task, when the girl came from her office and stood, her hands clasped behind her, before the desk of the senior partner.\n\nBones peered up in his short-sighted way.\n\n\"Well, young miss?\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Mr. Tibbetts,\" she began a little unsteadily, \"I'm going to be very impertinent.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"I've been with you for some time now,\" said the girl, speaking rapidly, \"and I feel that I have a better right to talk to you than--than----\"\n\n\"Than anybody in the whole wide world,\" said Bones, \"and that's a fact, dear young Marguerite.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said hurriedly, \"but this is something about business, and about--about this deal which you're going into. I've been talking to Captain Hamilton this afternoon, while you were out, and I know it's a swindle.\"\n\n\"I know that, too,\" said Bones calmly.\n\n\"But,\" said the puzzled girl, \"you are putting all your money into it. Mr. Hamilton said that, if this failed, you might be ruined.\"\n\nBones nodded. Outwardly calm, the light of battle shone in his eye.\n\n\"It's a gamble, dear young typewriter,\" he said, \"a terrific gamble, but it's going to turn out all right for did Bones.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Hamilton said you can't possibly make anything from the property--that it is derelict and worth practically nothing. Only a tenth of the stores are open, and the trading is----\"\n\nBones smiled.\n\n\"I'm not gambling on the property,\" he said softly. \"Oh, dear, no, young fianc\u00e9e, I'm not gambling on the property.\"\n\n\"Then what on earth are you gambling on?\" she asked, a little piqued.\n\n\"On me,\" said Bones in the same tone. \"On poor old silly ass Bones, and I'm coming through!\"\n\nHe got up and came across to her and laid his big hand on her shoulder gently.\n\n\"If I don't come through, I shan't be a beggar. I shall have enough to build a jolly little place, where we can raise cows and horses and vegetables of all descriptions, dear old typewriter. And if I do come through, we'll still have that same place--only perhaps we'll have more cows and a pig or two.\"\n\nShe laughed, and he raised her smiling lips to his and kissed them.\n\nMr. de Vinne had dined well and had enjoyed an evening's amusement. He had been to the Hippodrome, and his enjoyment had been made the more piquant by the knowledge that Mr. Augustus Tibbetts had as good as placed ten thousand pounds in his pocket. He was a surprised man, on returning to Sloane Square, to discover, waiting in the hall, his unwilling benefactor."

  "Edgar Wallace -- \"Bones\": Being Further Adventures in Mr. Commissioner Sanders' Country": [
    "You will never know from the perusal of the Blue Book the true inwardness of the happenings in the Ochori country in the spring of the year of Wish. Nor all the facts associated with the disappearance of the Rt. Hon. Joseph Blowter, Secretary of State for the Colonies.\n\nWe know (though this is not in the Blue Books) that Bosambo called together all his petty chiefs and his headmen, from one end of the country to the other, and assembled them squatting expectantly at the foot of the little hillock, where sat Bosambo in his robes of office (unauthorized but no less magnificent), their upturned faces charged with pride and confidence, eloquent of the hold this sometime Liberian convict had upon the wayward and fearful folk of the Ochori.\n\nNow no man may call a palaver of all small chiefs unless he notifies the government of his intention, for the government is jealous of self-appointed parliaments, for when men meet together in public conference, however innocent may be its first cause, talk invariably drifts to war, just as when they assemble and talk in private it drifts womanward.\n\nAnd since a million and odd square miles of territory may only be governed by a handful of ragged soldiers so long as there is no concerted action against authority, extemporized and spontaneous palavers are severely discouraged.\n\nBut Bosambo was too cheery and optimistic a man to doubt that his action would incur the censorship of his lord, and, moreover, he was so filled with his own high plans and so warm and generous at heart at the thought of the benefits he might be conferring upon his patron that the illegality of the meeting did not occur to him, or if it occurred was dismissed as too preposterous for consideration.\n\nAnd so there had come by the forest paths, by canoe, from fishing villages, from far-off agricultural lands near by the great mountains, from timber cuttings in the lower forest, higher chiefs and little chiefs, headmen and lesser headmen, till they made a respectable crowd, too vast for the comfort of the Ochori elders who must needs provide them with food and lodgings.\n\n\"Noble chiefs of the Ochori,\" began Bosambo, and Notiki nudged his neighbour with a sharp elbow, for Notiki was an old man of forty-three, and thin.\n\n\"Our lord desires us to give him something,\" he said.\n\nHe was a bitter man this Notiki, a relative of former chiefs of the Ochori, and now no more than over-head of four villages.\n\n\"Wa!\" said his neighbour, with his shining face turned to Bosambo.\n\nNotiki grunted but said no more.\n\n\"I have assembled you here,\" said Bosambo, \"because I love to see you, and because it is good that I should meet those who are in authority under me to administer the laws which the King my master has set for your guidance.\"\n\nWord for word it was a paraphrase of an address which Sanders himself had delivered three months ago. His audience may have forgotten the fact, but Notiki at least recognized the plagiarism and said \"Oh, ho!\" under his breath and made a scornful noise.\n\n\"Now I must go from you,\" said Bosambo.\n\nThere was a little chorus of dismay, but Notiki's voice did not swell the volume.\n\n\"The King has called me to the coast, and for the space of two moons I shall be as dead to you, though my fetish will watch you and my spirit will walk these streets every night with big ears to listen to evil talk, and great big eyes to see the hearts of men. Yea, from this city to the very end of my dominions over to Kalala.\" His accusing eyes fixed Notiki, and the thin man wriggled uncomfortably.\n\n\"This man is a devil,\" he muttered under his breath, \"he hears and sees all things.\"\n\n\"And if you ask me why I go,\" Bosambo went on, \"I tell you this: swearing you all to secrecy that this word shall not go beyond your huts\" (there were some two thousand people present to share the mystery), \"my lord Sandi has great need of me. For who of us is so wise that he can look into the heart and understand the sorrow-call which goes from brother to brother and from blood to blood. I say no more save my lord desires me, and since I am the King of the Ochori, a nation great amongst all nations, must I go down to the coast like a dog or like the headman of a fisher-village?\"\n\nHe paused dramatically, and there was a faint--a very faint--murmur which he might interpret as an expression of his people's wish that he should travel in a state bordering upon magnificence.\n\nFaint indeed was that murmur, because there was a hint of taxation in the business, a promise of levies to be extracted from an unwilling peasantry; a suggestion of lazy men leaving the comfortable shade of their huts to hurry perspiring in the forest that gum and rubber and similar offerings should be laid at the complacent feet of their overlord.\n\nBosambo heard the murmur and marked its horrid lack of heartiness and was in no sense put out of countenance.\n\n\"As you say,\" said he approvingly, \"it is proper that I should journey to my lord and to the strange people beyond the coast--to the land where even slaves wear trousers--carrying with me most wonderful presents that the name of the Ochori shall be as thunder upon the waters and even great kings shall speak in pride of you,\" he paused again.\n\nNow it was a dead silence which greeted his peroration. Notably unenthusiastic was this gathering, twiddling its toes and blandly avoiding his eye. Two moons before he had extracted something more than his tribute--a tribute which was the prerogative of government.\n\nYet then, as Notiki said under his breath, or openly, or by innuendo as the sentiment of his company demanded, four and twenty canoes laden with the fruits of taxation had come to the Ochori city, and five only of those partly filled had paddled down to headquarters to carry the Ochori tribute to the overlord of the land.\n\n\"I will bring back with me new things,\" said Bosambo enticingly; \"strange devil boxes, large magics which will entrance you, things that no common man has seen, such as I and Sandi alone know in all this land. Go now, I tell thee, to your people in this country, telling them all that I have spoken to you, and when the moon is in a certain quarter they will come in joy bearing presents in both hands, and these ye shall bring to me.\"",
    "It would appear from all the correspondence which was subsequently published that Sanders had particularly warned Mr. Blowter against visiting the interior, that Sir Robert, that amiable man, had also expressed a warning, and that the august Government itself had sent a long and expensive telegram from Downing Street suggesting that a trip to the Ochori country was inadvisable in the present state of public feeling.\n\nThe hasty disposition on the part of certain Journals to blame Mr. Commissioner Sanders and his immediate superior for the kidnapping of so important a person as a Cabinet Minister was obviously founded upon an ignorance of the circumstances.\n\nYet Sanders felt himself at fault, as a conscientious man always will, if he has had the power to prevent a certain happening.\n\nThose loyal little servants of Government, carrier pigeons--went fluttering east, south and north, a missionary steamer was hastily requisitioned, and Sanders embarked for the scene of the disappearance.\n\nBefore he left he telegraphed to every likely coast town for Bosambo.\n\n\"If that peregrinating devil had not left his country this would not have happened,\" said Sanders irritably; \"he must come back and help me find the lost one.\"\n\nBefore any answer could come to his telegrams he had embarked, and it is perhaps as well that he did not wait, since none of the replies were particularly satisfactory. Bosambo was evidently un-get-at-able, and the most alarming rumour of all was that which came from Sierra Leone and was to the effect that Bosambo had embarked for England with the expressed intention of seeking an interview with a very high personage indeed.\n\nNow it is the fact that had Sanders died in the execution of his duty, died either from fever or as the result of scientific torturing at the hands of Akasava braves, less than a couple of lines in the London Press would have paid tribute to the work he had done or the terrible manner of his passing.\n\nBut a Cabinet Minister, captured by a cannibal tribe, offers in addition to alliterative possibilities in the headline department, a certain novelty particularly appealing to the English reader who loves above all things to have a shock or two with his breakfast bacon. England was shocked to its depths by the unusual accident which had occurred to the Right Honourable gentleman, partly because it is unusual for Cabinet Ministers to find themselves in a cannibal's hands, and partly because Mr. Blowter himself occupied a very large place in the eye of the public at home. For the first time in its history the eyes of the world were concentrated on Sanders' territory, and the Press of the world devoted important columns to dealing not only with the personality of the man who had been stolen, because they knew him well, but more or less inaccurately with the man who was charged with his recovery.\n\nThey also spoke of Bosambo \"now on his way to England,\" and it is a fact that a small fleet of motor-boats containing pressmen awaited the incoming coast mail at Plymouth only to discover that their man was not on board.\n\nHappily, Sanders was in total ignorance of the stir which the disappearance created. He knew, of course, that there would be talk about it, and had gloomy visions of long reports to be written. He would have felt happier in his mind if he could have identified Mimbimi with any of the wandering chiefs he had met or had known from time to time. Mimbimi was literally a devil he did not know.\n\nNor could any of the cities or villages which had received a visitation give the Commissioner more definite data than he possessed. Some there were who said that Mimbimi was a tall man, very thin, knobbly at the knees, and was wounded in the foot, so that he limped. Others that he was short and very ugly, with a large head and small eyes, and that when he spoke it was in a voice of thunder.\n\nSanders wasted no time in useless inquiries. He threw a cloud of spies and trackers into the forest of Bim-bi and began a scientific search; snatching a few hours sleep whenever the opportunity offered. But though the wings of his beaters touched the border line of the Ochori on the right and the Isisi on the left, and though he passed through places which hitherto had been regarded as impenetrable on account of divers devils, yet he found no trace of the cunning kidnapper, who, if the truth be told, had broken through the lines in the night, dragging an unwilling and exasperated member of the British Government at the end of a rope fastened about his person.",
    "Chief N'gori organized a surprise party for Bosambo, and took so much trouble with the details, that, because of his sheer thoroughness, he deserved to have succeeded. _Lokali_ men concealed in the bush were waiting to announce the coming of the rescue party, when N'gori sent his cry for help crashing across the world. Six hundred spearmen stood ready to embark in fifty canoes, and five hundred more waited on either bank ready to settle with any survivors of the Ochori who found their way to land.\n\nThe best of plans are subject to the banal reservation, \"weather permitting,\" and the signal intended to bring Bosambo to his destruction was swallowed up in the bellowings of the storm.\n\n\"This night being fine,\" said N'gori, showing his teeth, \"Bosambo will surely come.\"\n\nHis Chief Counsellor, an ancient man of the royal tribe,[2] had unexpected warnings to offer. A man had seen a man, who had caught a glimpse of the _Zaire_ butting her way upstream in the dead of night. Was it wise, when the devil Sandi waited to smite, and so close at hand, to engage in so high an adventure?\n\n\"Old man, there is a hut in the forest for you,\" said N'gori, with significance, and the Counsellor wilted, because the huts in the forest are for the sick, the old, and the mad, and here they are left to starve and die; \"for,\" N'gori went on, \"all men know that Sandi has gone to his people across the black waters, and the M'ilitani rules. Also, in nights of storms there are men who see even devils.\"\n\nWith more than ordinary care he prepared for the final settling with Bosambo the Robber, and there is a suggestion that he was encouraged by the chiefs of other lands, who had grown jealous of the Ochori and their offensive rectitude. Be that as it may, all things were made ready, even to the knives of sacrifice and the young saplings which had not been employed by the Akasava for their grisly work since the Year of Hangings.\n\nAt an hour before midnight the tireless _lokali_ sent out its call:\n\n\"We of the Akasava\" (four long rolls and a quick succession of taps)\n\n\"Danger threatens\" (a long roll, a short roll, and a triple tap-tap)\n\n\"Isisi fighting\" (rolls punctuated by shorter tattoos)\n\n\"Come to me\" (a long crescendo roll and patter of taps)\n\n\"Ochori\" (nine rolls, curiously like the yelping of a dog)\n\nSo the message went out: every village heard and repeated. The Isisi threw the call northward; the N'gombi village, sent it westward, and presently first the Isisi, then the N'gombi, heard the faint answer: \"Coming--the Breaker of Lives,\" and returned the message to N'gori.\n\n\"Now I shall also break lives,\" said N'gori, and sacrificed a goat to his success.\n\nSixteen hundred fighting men waited for the signal from the hidden _lokali_ player, on the far side of the river bend. At the first hollow rattle of his sticks, N'gori pushed off in his royal canoe.\n\n\"Kill!\" he roared, and went out in the white light of dawn to greet ten Ochori canoes, riding in fanshape formation, having as their centre a white and speckless _Zaire_ alive with Houssas and overburdened with the slim muzzles of Hotchkiss guns.\n\n\"Oh, Ko!\" said N'gori dismally, \"this is a bad palaver!\"\n\nIn the centre of his city, before a reproving squad of Houssas, a dumb man, taken in the act of armed aggression, N'gori stood.\n\n\"You're a naughty boy,\" said Bones, reproachfully, \"and if jolly old Sanders were here--my word, you'd catch it!\"\n\nN'gori listened to the unknown tongue, worried by its mystery. \"Lord, what happens to me?\" he asked.\n\nBones looked very profound and scratched his head. He looked at the Chief, at Bosambo, at the river all aglow in the early morning sunlight, at the _Zaire_, with her",
    "\"Very serious offence, old friend,\" said Bones, solemnly; \"awfully serious--muckin' about with spears and all that sort of thing. I'll have to make a dooce of an example of you--yes, by Heaven!\"\n\nBosambo heard and imperfectly understood. He looked about for a likely tree where an unruly chief might sway with advantage to the community.\n\n\"You're a bad, bad boy,\" said Bones, shaking his head; \"tell him.\"\n\n\"Yes, sah!\" said Bosambo.\n\n\"Tell him he's fined ten dollars.\"\n\nBut Bosambo did not speak: there are moments too full for words and this was one of them.\n\n\nLieutenant Augustus Tibbetts of the Houssas stood at attention before his chief. He stood as straight as a ramrod, his hands to his sides, his eyeglass jammed in his eye, and Hamilton of the Houssas looked at him sorrowfully.\n\n\"Bones, you're an ass!\" he said at last.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bones.\n\n\"I sent you to Ochori to prevent a massacre, you catch a chief in the act of ambushing an enemy and instead of chucking him straight into the Village of Iron you fine him ten dollars.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bones.\n\nThere was a painful pause.\n\n\"Well, you're an ass!\" said Hamilton, who could think of nothing better to say.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bones; \"I think you're repeating yourself, sir. I seem to have heard a similar observation before.\"\n\n\"You've made Bosambo and the whole of the Ochori as sick as monkeys, and you've made me look a fool.\"\n\n\"Hardly my responsibility, sir,\" said Bones, gently.\n\n\"I hardly know what to do with you,\" said Hamilton, drawing his pipe from his pocket and slowly charging it. \"Naturally, Bones, I can never let you loose again on the country.\" He lit his pipe and puffed thoughtfully. \"And of course----\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said Bones, still uncomfortably erect, \"this is intended to be a sort of official inquiry an' all that sort of thing, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Bones, \"may I ask you not to smoke? When a chap's honour an' reputation an' all that sort of thing is being weighed in the balance, sir, believe me, smokin' isn't decent--it isn't really, sir.\"\n\nHamilton looked round for something to throw at his critic and found a tolerably heavy book, but Bones dodged and fielded it dexterously. \"And if you must chuck things at me, sir,\" he added, as he examined the title on the back of the missile, \"will you avoid as far as possible usin' the sacred volumes of the Army List? It hurts me to tell you this, sir, but I've been well brought up.\"\n\n\"What's the time?\" asked Hamilton, and his second-in-command examined his watch.\n\n\"Ten to tiffin,\" he said. \"Good Lord, we've been gassin' an hour. Any news from Sanders?\"\n\n\"He's in town--that's all I know--but don't change the serious subject, Bones. Everybody is awfully disgusted with you--Sanders would have at least brought him to trial.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do it, sir,\" said Bones, firmly. \"Poor old bird! He looked such an ass, an' moreover reminded me so powerfully of an aunt of mine that I simply couldn't do it.\"\n\n\nNo doubt but that Lieut. Francis Augustus Tibbetts of the Houssas, with his sun-burnt nose, his large saucer eyes, and his air of solemn innocence, had shaken the faith of the impressionable folk. This much Hamilton was to learn: for Tibbetts had been sent with a party of Houssas to squash effectively an incipient rebellion in the Akasava, and having caught N'gori in the very act of most treacherously and most damnably preparing an ambush for a virtuous Bosambo, Chief of the Ochori, had done no more than fine him ten dollars.\n\nAnd this was in a land where even the Spanish dollar had never been seen save by Bosambo, who was reported to have more than his share of silver in a deep hole beneath the floor of his hut.\n\nSmall wonder that Captain Hamilton held an informal court-martial of one, the closing stages of which I have described, and sentenced his wholly inefficient subordinate to seven days' field exercise in the forest with half a company of Houssas.\n\n\"Oh, dash it, you don't mean that?\" asked Bones in dismay when the finding of the court was conveyed to him at lunch.\n\n\"I do,\" said Hamilton firmly. \"I'd be failing in my job of work if I didn't make you realize what a perfect ass you are.\"\n\n\"Perfect--yes,\" protested Bones, \"ass--no. Fact is, dear old fellow, I've a temperament. You aren't going to make me go about in that beastly forest diggin' rifle pits an' pitchin' tents an' all that sort of dam' nonsense; it's too grisly to think about.\"\n\n\"None the less,\" said Hamilton, \"you will do it whilst I go north to sit on the heads of all who endeavour to profit by your misguided leniency. I shall be back in time for the Administration Inspection--don't for the love of heaven forget that His Excellency----\"\n\n\"Bless his jolly old heart!\" murmured Bones.\n\n\"That His Excellency is paying his annual visit on the twenty-first.\"\n\nA ray of hope shot through the gloom of Lieut. Tibbetts' mind.\n\n\"Under the circumstances, dear old friend, don't you think it would be best to chuck that silly idea of field training? What about sticking up a board and gettin' the chaps to paint, 'Welcome to the United Territories,' or 'God bless our Home,' or something.\"\n\nHamilton withered him with a glance.\n\n\nHis last words, shouted from the bridge of the _Zaire_ as her stern wheel went threshing ahead, were, \"Remember, Bones! No shirking!\"\n\n_\"Honi soit qui mal y pense_!\" roared Bones.",
    "Hamilton had evidence enough of the effect which the leniency of his subordinate had produced. News travels fast, and the Akasava are great talkers. Hamilton, coming to the Isisi city on his way up the river, found a crowd on the beach to watch his mooring, their arms folded hugging their sides--sure gesture of indifferent idleness--but neither the paramount chief, nor his son, nor any of his counsellors awaited the steamer to pay their respects.\n\nHamilton sent for them and still they did not come, sending a message that they were sick. So Hamilton went striding through the street of the city, his long sword flapping at his side, four Houssas padding swiftly in his rear at their curious jog-trot. B'sano, the young chief of the Isisi, came out lazily from his hut and stood with outstretched feet and arms akimbo watching the nearing Houssa, and he had no fear, for it was said that now Sandi was away from the country no man had the authority to punish.\n\nAnd the counsellors behind B'sano had their bunched spears and their wicker-work shields, contrary to all custom--as Sanders had framed the custom.\n\n\"O chief,\" said Hamilton, with that ready smile of his, \"I waited for you and you did not come.\"\n\n\"Soldier,\" said B'sano, insolently, \"I am the king of these people and answerable to none save my lord Sandi, who, as you know, is gone from us.\"\n\n\"That I know,\" said the patient Houssa, \"and because it is in my heart to show all people what manner of law Sandi has left behind, I fine you and your city ten thousand _matakos_ that you shall remember that the law lives, though Sandi is in the moon, though all rulers change and die.\"\n\nA slow gleam of contempt came to the chief's eyes.\n\n\"Soldier,\" said he, \"I do not pay _matako--wa_!\"\n\nHe stumbled back, his mouth agape with fear. The long barrel of Hamilton's revolver rested coldly on his bare stomach.\n\n\"We will have a fire,\" said Hamilton, and spoke to his sergeant in Arabic. \"Here in the centre of the city we will make a fire of proud shields and unlawful spears.\"\n\nOne by one the counsellors dropped their wicker shields upon the fire which the Houssa sergeant had kindled, and as they dropped them, the sergeant scientifically handcuffed the advisers of the Isisi chief in couples.\n\n\"You shall find other counsellors, B'sano,\" said Hamilton, as the men were led to the _Zaire_. \"See that I do not come bringing with me a new chief.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said the chief humbly, \"I am your dog.\"\n\nNot alone was B'sano at fault. Up and down the road old grievances awaited settlement: there were scores to adjust, misunderstandings to remove. Mostly these misunderstandings had to do with important questions of tribal superiority and might only be definitely tested by sanguinary combat.\n\nAlso picture a secret order, ruthlessly suppressed by Sanders, and practised by trembling men, each afraid of the other despite their oaths; and the fillip it received when the news went forth--\"Sandi has gone--there is no law.\"\n\nThis was a fine time for the dreamers of dreams and for the men who saw portends and understood the wisdom of Ju-jus.\n\nBemebibi, chief of the Lesser Isisi, was too fat a man for a dreamer, for visions run with countable ribs and a cough. Nor was he tall nor commanding by any standard. He had broad shoulders and a short neck. His head was round, and his eyes were cunning and small. He was an irritable man, had a trick of beating his counsellors when they displeased him, and was a ready destroyer of men.\n\nSome say that he practised sacrifice in the forests, he and the members of his society, but none spoke with any certainty or authority, for Bemebibi was chief, alike of a community and an order. In the Lesser Isisi alone, the White Ghosts had flourished in spite of every effort of the Administration to stamp them out.\n\nIt was a society into which the hazardous youth of the Isisi were initiated joyfully, for there is little difference in the temperament of youth, whether it wears a cloth about its loins or lavender spats upon its feet.\n\nThus it came about that one-half of the adult male population of the Lesser Isisi, had sworn by the letting of blood and the rubbing of salt:\n(1) To hop upon one foot for a spear's length every night and morning.\n(2) To love all ghosts and speak gently of devils.\n(3) To be dumb and blind and to throw spears swiftly for the love of the White Ghosts.\n\nOne night Bemebibi went into the forest with six highmen of his order. They came to a secret place at a pool, and squatted in a circle, each man laying his hands on the soles of his feet in the prescribed fashion.\n\n\"Snakes live in holes,\" said Bemebibi conventionally. \"Ghosts dwell by water and all devils sit in the bodies of little birds.\"\n\nThis they repeated after him, moving their heads from side to side slowly.\n\n\"This is a good night,\" said the chief, when the ritual was ended, \"for now I see the end of our great thoughts. Sandi is gone and M'ilitini is by the place where the three rivers meet, and he has come in fear. Also by magic I have learnt that he is terrified because he knows me to be an awful man. Now, I think, it is time for all ghosts to strike swiftly.\"\n\nHe spoke with emotion, swaying his body from side to side after the manner of orators. His voice grew thick and husky as the immensity of his design grew upon him.\n\n\"There is no law in the land,\" he sang. \"Sandi has gone, and only a little, thin man punishes in fear. M'ilitini has blood like water--let us sacrifice.\"\n\nOne of his highmen disappeared into the dark forest and came back soon, dragging a half-witted youth, named Ko'so, grinning and mumbling and content till the curved N'gombi knife, that his captor wielded, came \"snack\" to his neck and then he spoke no more.\n\nToo late Hamilton came through the forest with his twenty Houssas. Bemebibi saw the end and was content to make a fight for it, as were his partners in crime.\n\n\"Use your bayonets,\" said Hamilton briefly, and flicked out his long, white sword. Bemebibi lunged at him with his stabbing spear, and Hamilton caught the poisoned spearhead on the steel guard, touched it aside, and drove forward straight and swiftly from his shoulder.\n\n\"Bury all these men,\" said Hamilton, and spent a beastly night in the forest.\n\nSo passed Bemebibi, and his people gave him up to the ghosts, him and his highmen.\n\nThere were other problems less tragic, to be dealt with, a Bosambo rather grieved than sulking, a haughty N'gori to be kicked to a sense of his unimportance, chiefs, major and minor, to be brought into a condition of penitence.\n\nHamilton went zigzagging up the river swiftly. He earned for himself in those days the name of \"Dragon-fly,\" or its native equivalent, and the illustration was apt, for it seemed that the _Zaire_ would poise, buzzing angrily, then dart off in unexpected directions, and the spirit of complacency which had settled upon the land gave place to one of apprehension, which, in the old days, followed the arrival of Sanders in a mood of reprisal.",
    "\"M'ilitani, there is a bad palaver in the N'bosini country,\" said the gossip-chief of the Lesser Isisi, and wagged his head impressively.\n\nHamilton of the Houssas rose up from his camp chair and stretched himself to his full six feet. His laughing eyes--terribly blue they looked in the mahogany setting of his lean face--quizzed the chief, and his clean-shaven lips twitched ever so slightly.\n\nChief Idigi looked at him curiously. Idigi was squat and fat, but wise.\nNone the less he gossiped, for, as they say on the river, \"Even the wise _oochiri_ is a chatterer.\"\n\n\"O, laughing Lord,\" said Idigi, almost humble in his awe--for blue eyes in a brown face are a great sign of devilry, \"this is no smiling palaver, for they say----\"\n\n\"Idigi,\" interrupted Hamilton, \"I smile when you speak of the N'bosini, because there is no such land. Even Sandi, who has wisdom greater than _ju-ju_, he says that there is no N'bosini, but that it is the foolish talk of men who cannot see whence come their troubles and must find a land and a people and a king out of their mad heads. Go back to your village, Idigi, telling all men that I sit here for a spell in the place of my lord Sandi, and if there be, not one king of N'bosini, but a score, and if he lead, not one army, but three and three and three, I will meet him with my soldiers and he shall go the way of the bad king.\"\n\nIdigi, unconvinced, shaking his head, said a doubtful \"_Wa!_\" and would continue upon his agreeable subject--for he was a lover of ghosts.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, impressively, \"it is said that on the night before the moon came, there was seen, on the edge of the lake-forest, ten warriors of the N'bosini, with spears of fire and arrows tipped with stars, also----\"\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" said Hamilton, cheerfully. \"The palaver is finished.\"\n\nLater, he watched Idigi--so humble a man that he never travelled with more than four paddlers--winding his slow way up stream--and Hamilton was not laughing.\n\nHe went back to his canvas chair before the Residency, and sat for half an hour, alternately pinching and rubbing his bare arms--he was in his shirt sleeves--in a reverie which was not pleasant.\n\nHere Lieutenant Augustus Tibbetts, returning from an afternoon's fishing, with a couple of weird-looking fish as his sole catch, found him and would have gone on with a little salute.\n\n\"Bones!\" called Hamilton, softly.\n\nBones swung round. \"Sir!\" he said stiffly.\n\n\"Come off your horse, Bones,\" coaxed Hamilton.\n\n\"Not me,\" replied Bones; \"I've finished with you, dear old fellow; as an officer an' a gentleman you've treated me rottenly--you have, indeed. Give me an order--I'll obey it. Tell me to lead a forlorn hope or go to bed at ten--I'll carry out instructions accordin' to military law, but outside of duty you're a jolly old rotter. I'm hurt, Ham, doocidly hurt. I think----\"\n\n\"Oh shut up and sit down!\" interrupted his chief, irritably. \"You jaw and jaw till my head aches.\"\n\nReluctantly Lieutenant Tibbetts walked back, depositing his catch with the greatest care on the ground.\n\n\"What on earth have you got there?\" asked Hamilton, curiously.\n\n\"I don't know whether it's cod or turbot,\" said the cautious Bones, \"but I'll have 'em cooked and find out.\"\n\nHamilton grinned. \"To be exact, they're catfish, and poisonous,\" he said, and whistled his orderly. \"Oh, Ahmet,\" he said in Arabic, \"take these fish and throw them away.\"\n\nBones fixed his monocle, and his eyes followed his catch till they were out of sight.\n\n\"Of course, sir,\" he said with resignation, \"if you like to commandeer my fish it's not for me to question you.\"\n\n\"I'm a little worried, Bones,\" began Hamilton.\n\n\"A conscience, sir,\" said Bones, smugly, \"is a pretty rotten thing for a feller to have. I remember years ago----\"\n\n\"There's a little unrest up there\"--Hamilton waved his hand towards the dark green forest, sombre in the shadows of the evening--\"a palaver I don't quite get the hang of. If I could only trust you, Bones!\"\n\nLieutenant Tibbetts rose. He readjusted his monocle and stiffened himself to attention--a heroic pose which invariably accompanied his protests. But Hamilton gave him no opportunity.\n\n\"Anyway, I have to trust you, Bones,\" he said, \"whether I like it or not. You get ready to clear out. Take twenty men and patrol the river between the Isisi and the Akasava.\"\n\nIn as few words as possible he explained the legend of the N'bosini. \"Of course, there is no such place,\" he said; \"it is a mythical land like the lost Atlantis--the home of the mysterious and marvellous tribes, populated by giants and filled with all the beautiful products of the world.\"\n\n\"I know, sir,\" said Bones, nodding his head. \"It is like one of those building estate advertisements you read in the American papers: Young-man-go-west-an'-buy-Dudville Corner Blocks----\"\n\n\"You have a horrible mind,\" said Hamilton. \"However, get ready. I will have steam in the _Zaire_ against your departure.\"\n\n\"There is one thing I should like to ask you about,\" said Bones, standing hesitatingly first on one leg and then on the other. \"I think I have told you before that I have tickets in a Continental sweepstake. I should be awfully obliged----\"\n\n\"Go away!\" snarled Hamilton.",
    "Mail day is ever a day of supreme interest for the young and for the matter of that for the middle-aged, too. Sanders hated mail days because the bulk of his correspondence had to do with Government, and Government never sat down with a pen in its hand to wish Sanders many happy returns of the day or to tell him scandalous stories about mutual friends. Rather the Government (by inference) told him scandalous stories about himself--of work not completed to the satisfaction of Downing Street--a thoroughfare given to expecting miracles. Hamilton had a sister who wrote wittily and charmingly every week, and there was another girl ... Still, two letters and a bright pink paper or two made a modest postbag by the side of Lieutenant Tibbetts' mail.\n\n\nThere came to Bones every mail day a thick wad of letters and parcels innumerable, and he could sit at the big table for hours on end, whistling a little out of tune, mumbling incoherently. He had a trick of commenting upon his letters aloud, which was very disconcerting for Hamilton. Bones wouldn't open a letter and get half-way through it before he began his commenting. \"... poor soul ... dear! dear! ... what a silly old ass ... ah, would you ... don't do it, Billy....\" To Hamilton's eyes the bulk of correspondence rather increased than diminished.\n\n\n\"You must owe a lot of money,\" he said one day. \"Eh!\" \"All these...!\" Hamilton opened his hand to a floor littered with discarded envelopes. \"I suppose they represent demands....\" \"Dear lad,\" said Bones brightly, \"they represent popularity--I'm immensely popular, sir,\" he gulped a little as he fished out two dainty envelopes from the pile before him; \"you may not have experienced the sensation, but I assure you, sir, it's pleasing, it's doocidly pleasing!\" \"Complacent ass,\" said Hamilton, and returned to his own correspondence.\n\n\nSystematically Bones went through his letters, now and again consulting a neat little morocco-covered note-book. (It would appear he kept a very careful record of every letter he wrote home, its contents, the date of its dispatch, and the reply thereto.) He had reduced letter writing to a passion, spent most of his evenings writing long epistles to his friends--mostly ladies of a tender age--and had incidentally acquired a reputation in the Old Country for his brilliant powers of narrative.\n\n\nThis, Hamilton discovered quite by accident. It would appear that Hamilton's sister had been on a visit--was in fact on the visit when she wrote one letter which so opened Hamilton's eyes--and mentioned that she was staying with some great friends of Bones'. She did not, of course, call him \"Bones,\" but \"Mr. Tibbetts.\" \"I should awfully like to meet him,\" she wrote, \"he must be a very interesting man. Aggie Vernon had a letter from him yesterday wherein he described his awful experience lion-hunting. To be chased by a lion and caught and then carried to the beast's lair must have been awful! Mr. Tibbetts is very modest about it in his letter, and beyond telling Aggie that he escaped by sticking his finger in the lion's eye he says little of his subsequent adventure. By the way, Pat, Aggie tells me that you had a bad bout of fever and that Mr. Tibbetts carried you for some miles to the nearest doctor. I wish you wouldn't keep these things so secret, it worries me dreadfully unless you tell me--even the worst about yourself. I hope your interesting friend returned safely from his dangerous expedition into the interior--he was on the point of leaving when his letter was dispatched and was quite gloomy about his prospects....\"\n\n\nHamilton read this epistle over and over again, then he sent for Bones. That gentleman came most cheerfully, full of fine animal spirits, and---- \"Just had a letter about you, Bones,\" said Hamilton carelessly. \"About me, sir!\" said Bones; \"from the War Office--I'm not being decorated or anything!\" he asked anxiously. \"No--nothing so tragic; it was a letter from my sister, who is staying with the Vernons.\" \"Oh!\" said Bones going suddenly red. \"What a modest devil you are,\" said the admiring Hamilton, \"having a lion hunt all to yourself and not saying a word about it to anybody.\" Bones made curious apologetic noises.\n\n\n\"I didn't know there were any lions in the country,\" pursued Hamilton remorselessly. \"Liars, yes! But lions, no! I suppose you brought them with you--and I suppose you know also, Bones, that it is considered in lion-hunting circles awfully rude to stick your finger into a lion's eye? It is bad sportsmanship to say the least, and frightfully painful for the lion.\" Bones was making distressful grimaces. \"How would you like a lion to stick his finger in _your_ eye?\" asked Hamilton severely; \"and, by the way, Bones, I have to thank you.\" He rose solemnly, took the hand of his reluctant and embarrassed second and wrung. \"Thank you,\" said Hamilton, in a broken voice, \"for saving my life.\" \"Oh, I say, sir,\" began Bones feebly. \"To carry a man eighty miles on your back is no mean accomplishment, Bones--especially when I was unconscious----\" \"I don't say you were unconscious, sir. In fact, sir----\" floundered Lieutenant Tibbetts as red as a peony. \"And yet I was unconscious,\" insisted Hamilton firmly. \"I am still unconscious, even to this day. I have no recollection of your heroic effort, Bones, I thank you.\"\n\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Bones, \"to make a clean breast of the whole affair----\" \"And this dangerous expedition of yours, Bones, an expedition from which you might never return--that,\" said Hamilton in a hushed voice, \"is the best story I have heard for years.\" \"Sir,\" said Bones, speaking under the stress of considerable emotion, \"I am clean bowled, sir. The light-hearted fairy stories which I wrote to cheer, so to speak, the sick-bed of an innocent child, sir, they have recoiled upon my own head. _Peccavi, mea culpi_, an' all those jolly old expressions that you'll find in the back pages of the dictionary.\" \"Oh, Bones, Bones!\" chuckled Hamilton. \"You mustn't think I'm a perfect liar, sir,\" began Bones, earnestly. \"I don't think you're a perfect liar,\" answered Hamilton, \"I think you're the most inefficient liar I've ever met.\" \"Not even a liar, I'm a romancist, sir,\" Bones stiffened with dignity and saluted, but whether he was saluting Hamilton, or the spirit of Romance, or in sheer admiration was saluting himself, Hamilton did not know.",
    "Now, about this time, Bosambo of the Ochori might, had he wished and had he the literary quality, have written many books about women, if for no other reason than because of a certain girl named D'riti. She was a woman of fifteen, grown to a splendid figure, with a proud head and a chin that tilted in contempt, for she was the daughter of Bosambo's chief counsellor, grand-daughter of an Ochori king, and ambitious to be wife of Bosambo himself. \"This is a mad thing,\" said Bosambo when her father offered the suggestion; \"for, as you know, T'meli, I have one wife who is a thousand wives to me.\" \"Lord, I will be ten thousand,\" said D'riti, present at the interview and bold; \"also, Lord, it was predicted at my birth that I should marry a king and the greater than a king.\" \"That is me,\" said Bosambo, who was without modesty; \"yet, it cannot be.\"\n\n\nSo they married D'riti to a chief's son who beat her till one day she broke his thick head with an iron pot, whereupon he sent her back to her father demanding the return of his dowry and the value of his pot. She had her following, for she was a dancer of fame and could twist her lithe body into enticing shapes. She might have married again, but she was so scornful of common men that none dare ask for her. Also the incident of the iron pot was not forgotten, and D'riti went swaying through the village--she walked from her hips, gracefully--a straight, brown, girl-woman desired and unasked. For she knew men too well to inspire confidence in them. By some weird intuition which certain women of all races acquire, she had probed behind their minds and saw with their eyes, and when she spoke of men, she spoke with a conscious authority, and such men, who were within earshot of her vitriolic comments, squirmed uncomfortably, and called her a woman of shame.\n\n\nSo matters stood when the _Zaire_ came flashing to the Ochori city and the heart of Bones filled with pleasant anticipation. Who was so competent to inform him on the matter of the souls of native women as Bosambo of the Ochori, already a crony of Bones, and admirable, if for no other reason, because he professed an open reverence for his new master? At any rate, after the haggle of tax collection was finished, Bones set about his task. \"Bosambo,\" said he, \"men say you are very wise. Now tell me something about the women of the Ochori.\" Bosambo looked at Bones a little startled. \"Lord,\" said he, \"who knows about women? For is it not written in the blessed Sura of the Djin that women and death are beyond understanding?\" \"That may be true,\" said Bones, \"yet, behold, I make a book full of wise and wonderful things and it would be neither wise nor wonderful if there was no word of women.\" And he explained very seriously indeed that he desired to know of the soul of native womanhood, of her thoughts and her dreams and her high desires. \"Lord,\" said Bosambo, after a long thought, \"go to your ship: presently I will send to you a girl who thinks and speaks with great wisdom--and if she talks with you, you shall learn more things than I can tell you.\"\n\n\nTo the _Zaire_ at sundown came D'riti, a girl of proper height, hollow backed, bare to the waist, with a thin skirting of fine silk cloth which her father had brought from the Coast, wound tightly about her, yet not so tightly that it hampered her swaying, lazy walk. She stood before a disconcerted Bones, one small hand resting on her hip, her chin (as usual) tilted down at him from under lashes uncommonly long for a native. Also, this Bones saw, she was gifted with more delicate features than the native woman can boast as a rule. The nose was straight and narrow, the lips full, yet not of the negroid type. She was in fact a pure Ochori woman, and the Ochori are related dimly to the Arabi tribes. \"Lord, Bosambo the King has sent me to speak about women,\" she said simply. \"Doocidly awkward,\" said Bones to himself, and blushed. \"O, D'riti,\" he stammered, \"it is true I wish to speak of women, for I make a book that all white lords will read.\" \"Therefore have I come,\" she said. \"Now listen, O my lord, whilst I tell you of women, and of all they think, of their love for men and of the strange way they show it. Also of children----\" \"Look here,\" said Bones, loudly. \"I don't want any--any--private information, my child----\" Then realizing from her frown that she did not understand him, he returned to Bomongo. \"Lord, I will say what is to be said,\" she remarked, meekly, \"for you have a gentle face and I see that your heart is very pure.\"\n\n\nThen she began, and Bones listened with open mouth ... later he was to feel his hair rise and was to utter gurgling protests, for she spoke with primitive simplicity about things that are never spoken about at all. He tried to check her, but she was not to be checked. \"Goodness, gracious heavens!\" gasped Bones. She told him of what women think of men, and of what men _think_ women think of them, and there was a remarkable discrepancy if she spoke the truth. He asked her if she was married. \"Lord,\" she said at last, eyeing him thoughtfully, \"it is written that I shall marry one who is greater than chiefs.\" \"I'll bet you will, too,\" thought Bones, sweating. At parting she took his hand and pressed it to her cheek. \"Lord,\" she said, softly, \"to-morrow when the sun is nearly down, I will come again and tell you more....\"\n\n\nBones left before daybreak, having all the material he wanted for his book and more. He took his time descending the river, calling at sundry places. At Ikan he tied up the _Zaire_ for the night, and whilst his men were carrying the wood aboard, he settled himself to put down the gist of his discoveries. In the midst of his labours came Abiboo. \"Lord,\" said he, \"there has just come by a fast canoe the woman who spoke with you last night.\" \"Jumping Moses!\" said Bones, turning pale, \"say to this woman that I am gone----\" But the woman came round the corner of the deck-house, shyly, yet with a certain confidence. \"Lord,\" she said, \"behold I am here, your poor slave; there are wonderful things about women which I have not told you----\" \"O, D'riti!\" said Bones in despair, \"I know all things, and it is not lawful that you should follow me so far from your home lest evil be said of you.\" He sent her to the hut of the chief's wife--M'lini-fo-bini of Ikan--with instructions that she was to be returned to her home on the following morning. Then he went back to his work, but found it strangely distasteful. He left nothing to chance the next day. With the dawn he slipped down the river at full speed, never so much as halting till day began to fail, and he was a short day's journey from headquarters. \"Anyhow, the poor dear won't overtake me to-day,\" he said--only to find the \"poor dear\" had stowed herself away on the steamer in the night behind a pile of wood.",
    "Bosambo of the Ochori was a light sleeper, the lighter because of certain stories which had reached him of a stranger who walks by night, and in the middle of the night he suddenly became wide awake, conscious that there was a man in his hut of whose coming the sentry without was ignorant. Bosambo's hand went out stealthily for his short spear, but before he could reach it, his wrist was caught in a grip of steel, strong fingers gripped his throat, and the intruder whispered fiercely, using certain words which left the chief helpless with wonder. \"I am M'gani of the Night,\" said the voice with authoritative hauteur, \"of me you have heard, for I am known only to chiefs; and am so high that chiefs obey and even devils go quickly from my path.\" \"O, M'gani, I hear you,\" whispered Bosambo, \"how may I serve you?\" \"Get me food,\" said the imperious stranger, \"after, you shall make a bed for me in your inner room, and sit before this house that none may disturb me, for it is to my high purpose that no word shall go to M'ilitani that I stay in your territory.\" \"M'gani, I am your dog,\" said Bosambo, and stole forth from the hut like a thief to obey.\n\n\nAll that day he sat before his hut and even sent away the wife of his heart and the child M'sambo, that the rest of M'gani of the N'gombi should not be disturbed. That night when darkness had come and the glowing red of hut fires grew dimmer, M'gani came from the hut. Bosambo had sent away the guard and accompanied his guest to the end of the village. M'gani, with only a cloak of leopard skin about him, twirling two long spears as he walked, was silent till he came to the edge of the city where he was to take farewell of his host. \"Tell me this, Bosambo, where are Sandi's spies that I may avoid them?\" And Bosambo, without hesitation, told him. \"M'gani,\" said he, at parting, \"where do you go now? tell me that I may send cunning men to guard you, for there is a bad spirit in this land, especially amongst the people of Lombobo, because I have offended B'limi Saka, the chief.\" \"No soldiers do I need, O Bosambo,\" said the other. \"Yet I tell you this that I go to quiet places to learn that which will be best for my people.\" He turned to go. \"M'gani,\" said Bosambo, \"in the day when you shall see our lord Sandi, speak to him for me saying that I am faithful, for it seems to me, so high a man are you that he will listen to your word when he will listen to none other.\" \"I hear,\" said M'gani gravely, and slipped into the shadows of the forest.\n\n\nBosambo stood for a long time staring in the direction which M'gani had taken, then walked slowly back to his hut. In the morning came the chief of his councillors for a hut palaver. \"Bosambo,\" said he, in a tone of mystery, \"the Walker-of-the-Night has been with us.\" \"Who says this?\" asked Bosambo. \"Fibini, the fisherman,\" said the councillor, \"for this he says, that having toothache, he sat in the shadow of his hut near the warm fire and saw the Walker pass through the village and with him, lord, one who was like a devil, being big and very ugly.\" \"Go to Fibini,\" said a justly annoyed Bosambo, \"and beat him on the feet till he cries--for he is a liar and a spreader of alarm.\" Yet Fibini had done his worst before the bastinado (an innovation of Bosambo's) had performed its silencing mission, and Ochori mothers shepherded their little flocks with greater care when the sun went down that night, for this new terror which had come to the land, this black ghost with the wildfire fame was reputed especially devilish. In a week he had become famous--so swift does news carry in the territories. Men had seen him passing through forest paths, or speeding with incredible swiftness along the silent river. Some said that he had no boat and walked the waters, others that he flew like a bat with millions of bats behind him. One had met him face to face and had sunk to the ground before eyes \"that were very hot and red and thrusting out little lightnings.\" He had been seen in many places in the Ochori, in the N'gombi city, in the villages of the Akasava, but mainly his hunting ground was the narrow strip of territory which is called Lombobo.\n\n\nB'limi Saka, the chief of the land, himself a believer in devils, was especially perturbed lest the Silent Walker should be a spy of Government, for he had been guilty of practices which were particularly obnoxious to the white men who were so swift to punish. \"Yet,\" said he to his daughter and (to the disgust of his people, who despised women) his chief councillor, \"none know my heart save you, Lamalana.\" Lamalana, with her man shoulders and her flat face, peered at her grizzled father sideways. \"Devils hear hearts,\" she said huskily, \"and when they talk of killings and sacrifices are not all devils pleased? Now I tell you this, my father, that I wait for sacrifices which you swore by death you would show me.\" B'limi Saka looked round fearfully. Though the ferocity of this chief was afterwards revealed, though secret places in the forest held his horrible secret killing-houses, yet he was a timid man with a certain affection of his eyes which made him dependent upon the childless widow who had been his strength for two years. The Lombobo were the cruellest of Sanders' people; their chiefs the most treacherous. Neither akin to the N'gombi, the Isisi, the Akasava nor the Ochori, they took on the worst attributes of each race. Seldom in open warfare did they challenge the Administration, but there was a long tale of slain and mutilated enemies who floated face downwards in the stream; of disappearance of faithful servants of Government, and of acts of cannibalism which went unidentified and unpunished. For though all the tribes, save the Ochori, had been cannibals, yet by fire and rope, tempered with wisdom, had the Administration brought about a newer era to the upper river. But reformation came not to the Lombobo. A word from Sanders, a carelessly expressed view, and the Lombobo people would have been swept from existence--wiped ruthlessly from the list of nations, but that was not the way of Government, which is patient and patient and patient again till in the end, by sheer heavy weight of patience, it crushes opposition to its wishes.\n\n\nThey called Lamalana the barren woman, the Drinker of Life, but she had at least drunken without ostentation, and if she murdered with her own large hands, or staked men and women from a sheer lust of cruelty, there were none alive to speak against her. Outside the town of Lombobo[6] was a patch of beaten ground where no grass grew, and this place was called \"wa boma,\" the killing ground.\n\n\n[Footnote 6: The territories are invariably named after the principal city, which is sometimes, perhaps, a little misleading.--E. W.]\n\n\nHere, before the white men came, sacrifices were made openly, and it was perhaps for this association and because it was, from its very openness, free from the danger of the eavesdropper, that Lamalana and her father would sit by the hour, whilst he told her the story of ancient horrors--never too horrible for the woman who swayed to and fro as she listened as one who was hypnotized.",
    "A sentry who dozed across the threshold of Hamilton's hut was not aware of his return; and silently, with fiercely whispered injunctions, so that the surprise should be all the more complete, Bones landed his unruly cargo, its feet chained, his great muzzle lassoed and bound with raw hide, its powerful and damaging tail firmly fixed between two planks of wood (a special idea for which Bones was responsible). Then Lieutenant Tibbetts went to the hut of his chief and woke him.\n\n\"So here you are, are you?\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"I am here,\" said Bones with trembling pride, so that Hamilton knew his subordinate had been successful; \"according to your instructions, sir, I have captured the green crocodile. He is of monstrous size, and vastly superior to your partly-worn lady friend. Also,\" he said, \"as per your instructions, conveyed to me in your letter dated the twenty-third instant, I have fastened same by right leg in the vicinity of the pool; at least,\" he corrected carefully, \"he was fastened, but owing to certain technical difficulties he slipped cable, so to speak, and is wallowing in his native element.\"\n\n\"You are not rotting, Bones, are you?\" asked Hamilton, busy with his toilet.\n\n\"Perfectly true and sound, sir, I never rot,\" said Bones stiffly; \"give me a job of work to do, give me a task, put me upon my metal, sir, and with the assistance of jolly old Bosambo----\"\n\n\"Is Bosambo in this?\"\n\nBones hesitated.\n\n\"He assisted me very considerably, sir,\" he said; \"but, so to speak, the main idea was mine.\"\n\nThe chief's drum summoned the villages to the palaver house, but the news had already filtered through the little township, and a crowd had gathered waiting eagerly to hear the message which Hamilton had to give them.\n\n\"O people,\" he said, addressing them from the hill of palaver, \"all I have promised you I have performed. Behold now in the pool--and you shall come with me to see this wonder--is one greater than M'zooba, a vast and splendid spirit which shall protect your crops and be as M'zooba was, and better than was M'zooba. All this I have done for you.\"\n\n\"Lord Tibbetti has done for you,\" prompted Bones, in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\"All this have I done for you,\" repeated Hamilton firmly, \"because I love you.\"\n\nHe led the way through the broad, straggling plantation to the great pool which begins in a narrow creek leading from the river and ends in a sprawl of water to the east of the village.\n\nThe whole countryside stood about watching the still water, but nothing happened.\n\n\"Can't you whistle him and make him come up or something?\" asked Hamilton.\n\n\"Sir,\" said an indignant Bones, \"I am no crocodile tamer; willing as I am to oblige you, and clever as I am with parlour tricks, I have not yet succeeded in inducing a crocodile to come to heel after a week's acquaintance.\"\n\nBut native people are very patient.\n\nThey stood or squatted, watching the unmoved surface of the water for half an hour, and then suddenly there was a stir and a little gasp of pleasurable apprehension ran through the assembly.\n\nThen slowly the new one came up. He made for a sand-bank, which showed above the water in the centre of the pool; first his snout, then his long body emerged from the water, and Hamilton gasped.\n\n\"Good heavens, Bones!\" he said in a startled whisper, and his astonishment was echoed from a thousand throats.\n\nAnd well might he be amazed at the spectacle which the complacent Bones had secured for him.\n\nFor this great reptile was more than green, he was a green so vivid that it put the colours of the forest to shame. A bright, glittering green and along the centre of his broad back one zig-zag splash of orange.\n\n\"Phew,\" whistled Hamilton, \"this is something like.\"\n\nThe roar of approval from the people was unmistakable. The crocodile turned his evil head and for a moment, as it seemed to Bones, his eyes glinted viciously in the direction of the young and enterprising officer. And Bones admitted after to a feeling of panic.\n\nThen with a malignant \"woof!\" like the hoarse, growling bark of a dog, magnified a hundred times, he slid back into the water, a great living streak of vivid green and disappeared to the cool retreat at the bottom of the pool.\n\n\"You have done splendidly, Bones, splendidly!\" said Hamilton, and clapped him on the back; \"really you are a most enterprising devil.\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir,\" said Bones.\n\nHe ate his dinner on the _Zaire_, answering with monosyllables the questions which Hamilton put to him regarding the quest and the place of the origin of this wonderful beast. It was after dinner when they were smoking their cigars in the gloom as the _Zaire_ was steaming across its way to the shore where a wooding offered an excuse for a night's stay, and Bones gave voice to his thoughts.\n\nAnd curiously enough his conversation did not deal directly or indirectly with his discovery.\n\n\"When was this boat decorated last, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"About six months before Sanders left,\" replied Hamilton in surprise; \"just why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" said Bones, and whistled light-heartedly. Then he returned to the subject.\n\n\"I only asked you because I thought the enamel work in the cabin and all that sort of thing has worn very well.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is good wearing stuff,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"That green paint in the bathroom is rather _chic_, isn't it? Is that good wearing stuff?\"\n\n\"The enamel?\" smiled Hamilton. \"Yes, I believe that is very good wearing. I am not a whale on domestic matters, Bones, but I should imagine that it would last for another year without showing any sign of wear.\"\n\n\"Is it waterproof at all?\" asked Bones, after another pause.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean would it wash off if a lot of water were applied to it?\"\n\n\"No, I should not imagine it would,\" said Hamilton, \"what makes you ask?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing!\" said Bones carelessly and whistled, looking up to the stars that were peeping from the sky; and the inside of Lieutenant Tibbetts was one large expansive grin.",
    "Bones reached the village two hours before the time of sacrifice and landed a force of twenty Houssas and a small Maxim gun. The village was peaceable, and there was no sign of anything untoward. Save this. The village was given over to old people and children. M'bisibi was an hour--two hours--four hours in the forest. He had gone north--east--south--none knew whither.\n\nThe very evasiveness of the replies put Bones into a fret. He scouted the paths and found indications of people having passed over all three.\n\nHe sent his gun back to the _Zaire_, divided his party into three, and accompanied by half a dozen men, he himself took the middle path.\n\nFor an hour he trudged, losing his way, and finding it again. He came upon a further division of paths and split up his little force again.\n\nIn the end he found himself alone, struggling over the rough ground in a darkness illuminated only by the electric lamp he carried, and making for a faint gleam of red light which showed through the trees ahead.\n\nM'bisibi held the child on his outstretched hands, a fat little child, with large, wondering eyes that stared solemnly at the dancing flames, and sucked a small brown thumb contentedly.\n\n\"Behold this child, oh chiefs and people,\" said M'bisibi, \"who was born as I predicted, and is filled with devils!\"\n\nThe baby turned his head so that his fat little neck was all rolled and creased, and said \"Ah!\" to the pretty fire, and chuckled.\n\n\"Even now the devils speak,\" said M'bisibi, \"but presently you shall hear them screaming through the world because I have scattered them,\" and he made his way to the bowed saplings.\n\nBones, his face scratched and bleeding, his uniform torn in a dozen places, came swiftly after him.\n\n\"My bird, I think,\" said Bones, and caught the child unscientifically.\n\nPicture Bones with a baby under his arm--a baby indignant, outraged, infernally uncomfortable, and grimacing a yell into being.\n\n\"Lord,\" said M'bisibi, breathing quickly, \"what do you seek?\"\n\n\"That which I have,\" said Bones, waving him off with the black muzzle of his automatic Colt. \"Tomorrow you shall answer for many crimes.\"\n\nHe backed quickly to the cover of the woods, scenting the trouble that was coming.\n\nHe heard the old man's roar.\n\n\"O people ... this white man will loose devils upon the land!\"\n\nThen a throwing spear snicked the trunk of a tree, and another, for there were no soldiers, and this congregation of exorcisers were mad with wrath at the thought of the evil which Tibbetti was preparing for them.\n\n\"Snick!\"\n\nA spear struck Bones' boot.\n\n\"Shut your eyes, baby,\" said Bones, and fired into the brown. Then he ran for his life. Over roots and fallen trees he fell and stumbled, his tiny passenger yelling desperately.\n\n\"Oh, shut up!\" snarled Bones, \"what the dickens are you shouting about--hey? Haven't I saved your young life, you ungrateful little devil?\"\n\nNow and again he would stop to consult his illuminated compass. That the pursuit continued he knew, but he had the dubious satisfaction of knowing, too, that he had left the path and was in the forest.\n\nThen he heard a faint shot, and another, and another, and grinned.\n\nHis pursuers had stumbled upon a party of Houssas.\n\nFrom sheer exhaustion the baby had fallen asleep. Babies were confoundedly heavy--Bones had never observed the fact before, but with the strap of his sword belt he fashioned a sling that relieved him of some of the weight.\n\nHe took it easier now, for he knew M'bisibi's men would be frightened off. He rested for half an hour on the ground, and then came a snuffling leopard walking silently through the forest, betraying his presence only by the two green danger-lamps of his eyes.\n\nBones sat up and flourished his lamp upon the startled beast, which growled in fright, and went scampering through the forest like the great cat that he was.\n\nThe growl woke Bones' charge, and he awoke hungry and disinclined to further sleep without that inducement and comfort which his nurse was in no position to offer, whereupon Bones snuggled the whimpering child.\n\n\"He's a wicked old leopard!\" he said, \"to come and wake a child at this time of the night.\"",
    "Bones, fishing in the river below Ikan, picked up the instructions, and went flying up the river as fast as the new naphtha launch could carry him.\n\nHe arrived in time to cover the shattered remnants of Bosambo's fleet as they were being swept northward from whence they came.\n\nBones went inshore to the island, the water jacket of a Maxim gun exposed over the bow, but there was no opposition.\n\n\"What the dooce is all this about--hey?\" demanded Lieutenant Tibbetts fiercely, and Iberi, doubly uneasy at the sound of an unaccustomed language, stood on one leg in his embarrassment.\n\n\"Lord, the thief Bosambo----\" he began, and told the story.\n\n\"Lord,\" he concluded humbly, \"I say all this though Bosambo is your relation since you have secretly married his sister's cousin.\"\n\nWhereupon Bones went very red and stammered and spluttered in such a way that the chief knew for sure that Bosambo had spoken the truth.\n\nBones, as I have said before, was no fool. He confirmed Bosambo's order for the evacuation of the island, but left a Houssa guard to hold it.\n\nThen he hurried north to the Ochori.\n\nBosambo formed his royal procession, but there was no occasion for it, for Bones was in no processional mood.\n\n\"What the dooce do you mean, sir?\" demanded a glaring and threatening Bones, his helmet over his neck, his arms akimbo. \"What do you mean, sir, by saying I'm married to your infernal aunt?\"\n\n\"Sah,\" said Bosambo, virtuous and innocent, \"I no savvy you--I no compreney, sah! You lib for my house--I give you fine t'ings. I make um moosic, sah----\"\n\n\"You're a jolly old rotter, Bosambo!\" said Bones, shaking his finger in the chief's face. \"I could punish you awfully for telling wicked stories, Bosambo. I'm disgusted with you, I am indeed.\"\n\n\"Lord who never sleeps,\" began Bosambo, humbly.\n\n\"Hey?\"\n\nBones stared at the other in amazement, suspicion, hope, and gratification in his face.\n\n\"O, Bosambo,\" said he mildly, and speaking in the native tongue, \"why do you call me by that name?\"\n\nNow, Bosambo in his innocence had used a phrase (_M'wani-m'wani_) which signifies \"the sleepless one,\" and also stands in the vernacular for \"busy-body,\" or one who is eternally concerned with other people's business.\n\n\"Lord,\" said Bosambo, hastily, \"by this name are you known from the mountains to the sea. Thus all men speak of you, saying: 'This is he who does not sleep but watches all the time.'\"\n\nBones was impressed, he was flattered, and he ran his finger between the collar of his uniform jacket and his scraggy neck as one will do who is embarrassed by praise and would appear unconcerned under the ordeal.\n\n\"So men call me, Bosambo,\" said he carelessly \"though my lord M'ilitani does not know this--therefore in the day when M'ilitani comes, speak of me as _M'wani-m'wani_ that he may know of whom men speak when they say 'the sleepless one.'\"\n\nEverybody knows that _Cala cala_ great chiefs had stored against the hour of their need certain stocks of ivory.\n\nDead ivory it is called because it had been so long cut, but good cow ivory, closer in grain than the bull elephant brought to the hunter, more turnable, and of greater value.\n\nThere is no middle island on the river about which some legend or buried treasure does not float.\n\nHamilton, hurrying forward to the support of his second-in-command, stopped long enough to interview two sulky chiefs.\n\n\"What palaver is this?\" he demanded of Iberi, \"that you carry your spears to a killing? For is not the river big enough for all, and are there no burying-places for your old men that you should fight so fiercely?\"\n\n\"Lord,\" confessed Iberi, \"upon that island is a treasure which has been hidden from the beginning of time, and that is the truth--N'Yango!\"\n\nNow, no man swears by his mother unless he is speaking straightly, and Hamilton understood.\n\n\"Never have I spoken of this to the Chief of the Isisi,\" Iberi went on, \"nor he to me, yet we know because of certain wise sayings that the treasure stays and young men of our houses have searched very diligently though secretly. Also Bosambo knows, for he is a cunning man, and when we found he had put his warriors to the seeking we fought him, lord, for though the treasure may be Isisi or Akasava, of this I am sure it is not of the Ochori.\"\n\nHamilton came to the Ochori city to find a red-eyed Bones stalking majestically up and down the beach.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" demanded Hamilton. \"Fever?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied Bones, huskily; but with a fine carelessness.\n\n\"You look as if you hadn't had a sleep for months,\" said Hamilton.\n\nBones shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Dear old fellow,\" said he, \"it isn't for nothing that I'm called 'the sleepless one'--don't make sceptical noises, dear old officer, but pursue your inquiries among the indigenous natives, especially Bosambo--an hour is all I want--just a bit of a snooze and a bath and I'm bright an' vigilant.\""

  "H. Rider Haggard -- Maiwa's Revenge; Or, The War of the Little Hand": [
    "One day\u2014it was about a week after Allan Quatermain told me his story of the \u201cThree Lions,\u201d and of the moving death of Jim-Jim\u2014he and I were walking home together on the termination of a day\u2019s shooting. He owned about two thousand acres of shooting round the place he had bought in Yorkshire, over a hundred of which were wood. It was the second year of his occupation of the estate, and already he had reared a very fair head of pheasants, for he was an all-round sportsman, and as fond of shooting with a shot-gun as with an eight-bore rifle. We were three guns that day, Sir Henry Curtis, Old Quatermain, and myself; but Sir Henry was obliged to leave in the middle of the afternoon in order to meet his agent, and inspect an outlying farm where a new shed was wanted. However, he was coming back to dinner, and going to bring Captain Good with him, for Brayley Hall was not more than two miles from the Grange.\n\nWe had met with very fair sport, considering that we were only going through outlying cover for cocks. I think that we had killed twenty-seven, a woodcock and a leash of partridges which we secured out of a driven covey. On our way home there lay a long narrow spinney, which was a very favourite \u201clie\u201d for woodcocks, and generally held a pheasant or two as well.\n\n\u201cWell, what do you say?\u201d said old Quatermain, \u201cshall we beat through this for a finish?\u201d\n\nI assented, and he called to the keeper who was following with a little knot of beaters, and told him to beat the spinney.\n\n\u201cVery well, sir,\u201d answered the man, \u201cbut it\u2019s getting wonderful dark, and the wind\u2019s rising a gale. It will take you all your time to hit a woodcock if the spinney holds one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou show us the woodcocks, Jeffries,\u201d answered Quatermain quickly, for he never liked being crossed in anything to do with sport, \u201cand we will look after shooting them.\u201d\n\nThe man turned and went rather sulkily. I heard him say to the under-keeper, \u201cHe\u2019s pretty good, the master is, I\u2019m not saying he isn\u2019t, but if he kills a woodcock in this light and wind, I\u2019m a Dutchman.\u201d\n\nI think that Quatermain heard him too, though he said nothing. The wind was rising every minute, and by the time the beat begun it blew big guns. I stood at the right-hand corner of the spinney, which curved round somewhat, and Quatermain stood at the left, about forty paces from me. Presently an old cock pheasant came rocketing over me, looking as though the feathers were being blown out of his tail. I missed him clean with the first barrel, and was never more pleased with myself in my life than when I doubled him up with the second, for the shot was not an easy one. In the faint light I could see Quatermain nodding his head in approval, when through the groaning of the trees I heard the shouts of the beaters, \u201cCock forward, cock to the right.\u201d Then came a whole volley of shouts, \u201cWoodcock to the right,\u201d \u201cCock to the left,\u201d \u201cCock over.\u201d\n\nI looked up, and presently caught sight of one of the woodcocks coming down the wind upon me like a flash. In that dim light I could not follow all his movements as he zigzagged through the naked tree-tops; indeed I could see him when his wings flitted up. Now he was passing me\u2014_bang_, and a flick of the wing, I had missed him; _bang_ again. Surely he was down; no, there he went to my left.\n\n\u201cCock to you,\u201d I shouted, stepping forward so as to get Quatermain between me and the faint angry light of the dying day, for I wanted to see if he would \u201cwipe my eye.\u201d I knew him to be a wonderful shot, but I thought that cock would puzzle him.\n\nI saw him raise his gun ever so little and bend forward, and at that moment out flashed two woodcocks into the open, the one I had missed to his right, and the other to his left.\n\nAt the same time a fresh shout arose of, \u201cWoodcock over,\u201d and looking down the spinney I saw a third bird high up in the air, being blown along like a brown and whirling leaf straight over Quatermain\u2019s head. And then followed the prettiest little bit of shooting that I ever saw. The bird to the right was flying low, not ten yards from the line of a hedgerow, and Quatermain took him first because he would become invisible the soonest of any. Indeed, nobody who had not his hawk\u2019s eyes could have seen to shoot at all. But he saw the bird well enough to kill it dead as a stone. Then turning sharply, he pulled on the second bird at about forty-five yards, and over he went. By this time the third woodcock was nearly over him, and flying very high, straight down the wind, a hundred feet up or more, I should say. I saw him glance at it as he opened his gun, threw out the right cartridge and slipped in another, turning round as he did so. By this time the cock was nearly fifty yards away from him, and travelling like a flash. Lifting his gun he fired after it, and, wonderful as the shot was, killed it dead. A tearing gust of wind caught the dead bird, and blew it away like a leaf torn from an oak, so that it fell a hundred and thirty yards off or more.\n\n\u201cI say, Quatermain,\u201d I said to him when the beaters were up, \u201cdo you often do this sort of thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he answered, with a dry smile, \u201cthe last time I had to load three shots as quickly as that was at rather larger game. It was at elephants. I killed them all three as dead as I killed those woodcocks; but it very nearly went the other way, I can tell you; I mean that they very nearly killed me.\u201d\n\nJust at that moment the keeper came up, \u201cDid you happen to get one of them there cocks, sir?\u201d he said, with the air of a man who did not in the least expect an answer in the affirmative.\n\n\u201cWell, yes, Jeffries,\u201d answered Quatermain; \u201cyou will find one of them by the hedge, and another about fifty yards out by the plough there to the left\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nThe keeper had turned to go, looking a little astonished, when Quatermain called him back.\n\n\u201cStop a bit, Jeffries,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see that pollard about one hundred and forty yards off? Well, there should be another woodcock down in a line with it, about sixty paces out in the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if that bean\u2019t the very smartest bit of shooting,\u201d murmured Jeffries, and departed.\n\nAfter that we went home, and in due course Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good arrived for dinner, the latter arrayed in the tightest and most ornamental dress-suit I ever saw. I remember that the waistcoat was adorned with five pink coral buttons.",
    "Moving some five or six miles round the base of the great peak of which I have spoken, we came the same day to one of the fairest bits of African country that I have seen outside of Kukuanaland. At this spot the mountain spur that runs out at right angles to the great range, which stretches its cloud-clad length north and south as far as the eye can reach, sweeps inwards with a vast and splendid curve. This curve measures some five-and-thirty miles from point to point, and across its moon-like segment the river flashed, a silver line of light. On the further side of the river is a measureless sea of swelling ground, a natural park covered with great patches of bush\u2014some of them being many square miles in extent. These are separated one from another by glades of grass land, broken here and there with clumps of timber trees; and in some instances by curious isolated koppies, and even by single crags of granite that start up into the air as though they were monuments carved by man, and not tombstones set by nature over the grave of ages gone. On the west this beautiful plain is bordered by the lonely mountain, from the edge of which it rolls down toward the fever coast; but how far it runs to the north I cannot say\u2014eight days\u2019 journey, according to the natives, when it is lost in an untravelled morass.\n\nOn the hither side of the river the scenery is different. Along the edge of its banks, where the land is flat, are green patches of swamp. Then comes a wide belt of beautiful grass land covered thickly with game, and sloping up very gently to the borders of the forest, which, beginning at about a thousand feet above the level of the plain, clothes the mountain-side almost to its crest. In this forest grow great trees, most of them of the yellow-wood species. Some of these trees are so lofty, that a bird in their top branches would be out of range of an ordinary shot gun. Another peculiar thing about them is, that they are for the most part covered with a dense growth of the Orchilla moss; and from this moss the natives manufacture a most excellent deep purple dye, with which they stain tanned hides and also cloth, when they happen to get any of the latter. I do not think that I ever saw anything more remarkable than the appearance of one of these mighty trees festooned from top to bottom with trailing wreaths of this sad-hued moss, in which the wind whispers gently as it stirs them. At a distance it looks like the gray locks of a Titan crowned with bright green leaves, and here and there starred with the rich bloom of orchids.\n\nThe night of that day on which I had my little difference of opinion with Gobo, we camped by the edge of this great forest, and on the following morning at daylight I started out shooting. As we were short of meat I determined to kill a buffalo, of which there were plenty about, before looking for traces of elephants. Not more than half a mile from camp we came across a trail broad as a cart-road, evidently made by a great herd of buffaloes which had passed up at dawn from their feeding ground in the marshes, to spend the day in the cool air of the uplands. This trail I followed boldly; for such wind as there was blew straight down the mountain-side, that is, from the direction in which the buffaloes had gone, to me. About a mile further on the forest began to be dense, and the nature of the trail showed me that I must be close to my game. Another two hundred yards and the bush was so thick that, had it not been for the trail, we could scarcely have passed through it. As it was, Gobo, who carried my eight-bore rifle (for I had the .570-express in my hand), and the other two men whom I had taken with me, showed the very strongest dislike to going any further, pointing out that there was \u2018no room to run away.\u2019 I told them that they need not come unless they liked, but that I was certainly going on; and then, growing ashamed, they came.\n\nAnother fifty yards, and the trail opened into a little glade. I knelt down and peeped and peered, but no buffalo could I see. Evidently the herd had broken up here\u2014I knew that from the spoor\u2014and penetrated the opposite bush in little troops. I crossed the glade, and choosing one line of spoor, followed it for some sixty yards, when it became clear to me that I was surrounded by buffaloes; and yet so dense was the cover that I could not see any. A few yards to my left I could hear one rubbing its horns against a tree, while from my right came an occasional low and throaty grunt which told me that I was uncomfortably near an old bull. I crept on towards him with my heart in my mouth, as gently as though I were walking upon eggs for a bet, lifting every little bit of wood in my path, and placing it behind me lest it should crack and warn the game. After me in single file came my three retainers, and I don\u2019t know which of them looked the most frightened. Presently Gobo touched my leg; I glanced round, and saw him pointing slantwise towards the left. I lifted my head a little and peeped over a mass of creepers; beyond the creepers was a dense bush of sharp-pointed aloes, of that kind of which the leaves project laterally, and on the other side of the aloes, not fifteen paces from us, I made out the horns, neck, and the ridge of the back of a tremendous old bull. I took my eight-bore, and getting on to my knee prepared to shoot him through the neck, taking my chance of cutting his spine. I had already covered him as well as the aloe leaves would allow, when he gave a kind of sigh and lay down.",
    "About nine o\u2019clock, half-an-hour before the moon-rise, I summoned Gobo, who, thinking that he had seen about enough of the delights of big game hunting for that day, did not altogether relish the job; and, despite his remonstrances, gave him my eight-bore to carry, I having the .570-express. Then we set out for the tree. It was very dark, but we found it without difficulty, though climbing it was a more complicated matter. However, at last we got up and sat down, like two little boys on a form that is too high for them, and waited. I did not dare to smoke, because I remembered the rhinoceros, and feared that the elephants might wind the tobacco if they should come my way, and this made the business more wearisome, so I fell to thinking and wondering at the completeness of the silence.\n\nAt last the moon came up, and with it a moaning wind, at the breath of which the silence began to whisper mysteriously. Lonely enough in the newborn light looked the wide expanse of mountain, plain, and forest, more like some vision of a dream, some reflection from a fair world of peace beyond our ken, than the mere face of garish earth made soft with sleep. Indeed, had it not been for the fact that I was beginning to find the log on which I sat very hard, I should have grown quite sentimental over the beautiful sight; but I will defy anybody to become sentimental when seated in the damp, on a very rough beam of wood, and half-way up a tree. So I merely made a mental note that it was a particularly lovely night, and turned my attention to the prospect of elephants. But no elephants came, and after waiting for another hour or so, I think that what between weariness and disgust, I must have dropped into a gentle doze. Presently I awoke with a start. Gobo, who was perched close to me, but as far off as the beam would allow\u2014for neither white man nor black like the aroma which each vows is the peculiar and disagreeable property of the other\u2014was faintly, very faintly clicking his forefinger against his thumb. I knew by this signal, a very favourite one among native hunters and gun-bearers, that he must have seen or heard something. I looked at his face, and saw that he was staring excitedly towards the dim edge of the bush beyond the deep green line of mealies. I stared too, and listened. Presently I heard a soft large sound as though a giant were gently stretching out his hands and pressing back the ears of standing corn. Then came a pause, and then, out into the open majestically stalked the largest elephant I ever saw or ever shall see. Heavens! what a monster he was; and how the moonlight gleamed upon his one splendid tusk\u2014for the other was broken short off about six inches from the lip. I should say that it must have weighed quite a hundred pounds.\n\nFor a moment the great brute stood still, slowly waving his trunk to and fro, and flapping his enormous ears, as though he were listening. Then he put his trunk down and began to feed upon the mealies, plucking the ears, and conveying them to his mouth with the easy grace of a daintily nurtured lady eating asparagus. I watched him for a minute or two, and then, as I was beginning to grow cramped, and the beam was cutting into my back, I made up my mind to shoot him. I knew that I could not get a heart shot, because he was standing sideways on to me, so I determined to try for the brain. Accordingly I took the .570-express, and aiming about three inches above the top of the trunk, at the spot where I judged the brain to be, I fired. The report rang out like a clap of thunder, and echoed and re-echoed from crag to crag till it died away in the distance. The elephant gave one mighty squeal, and then, to my intense disgust, turned round and bolted into the bush as though he had not been touched.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cI have made a mess of that job. I must have hit him too low, and only stunned him.\u201d\n\nJust then, however, Gobo, who had been staring into the bush, touched me on the arm.\n\n\u201cLook, Boss,\u201d he whispered, \u201che falls.\u201d\n\nI looked, and sure enough, about fifty yards away, I saw the great brute lying upon the ground. He was quite still, and evidently dead.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI am glad of that; but it was a poor shot all the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very good shot, Boss,\u201d answered Gobo, \u201cbut look, here come the other elephants.\u201d\n\nI looked, and saw that he was right. Out of the bush, about a hundred yards away, stalked two other great bull elephants. They were not quite so large as he whom I had just shot, but they were very fine animals, and one of them carried a beautiful pair of tusks. They advanced towards the dead elephant, and began to touch him with their trunks, and to smell him. Then they grew very excited, and lifting their trunks blew a perfect hurricane of shrill trumpetings into the air.\n\n\u201cNow\u2019s your time, Boss,\u201d whispered Gobo; \u201cshoot, shoot.\u201d\n\nI lifted my rifle, and taking a steady aim at the head of the elephant with the big tusks, fired. He fell like a stone, shot through the brain. As he did so the third elephant wheeled round and bolted back into the bush, trumpeting loudly as he went.\n\n\u201cThat is good,\u201d said Gobo; \u201cnow we have killed three elephants, and the people of the kraal will be very glad.\u201d\n\nI did not answer him, for just at that moment I heard a most tremendous hubbub proceeding from the kraal. Yells of terror, the shouts of men, and the screams of women mingled with the lowing of cattle and the furious barking of dogs.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up now?\u201d I said.\n\nGobo did not answer, but continued to stare excitedly towards the kraal. Presently, however, he spoke.\n\n\u201cI think, Boss,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the other elephant has gone into the kraal.\u201d",
    "\u201cThen they began to feed, walking forward and slightly to the right as they gathered great bunches of the sweet mealies and thrust them into their mouths. All this time they were more than a hundred and twenty yards away from me (this I knew, because I had paced the distances from the tree to various points), much too far to allow of my attempting a shot at them in that uncertain light. They fed in a semicircle, gradually drawing round towards the hut near my tree, in which the corn was stored and the old woman slept.\n\nThis went on for between an hour and an hour and a half, till, what between excitement and hope, that maketh the heart sick, I grew so weary that I was actually contemplating a descent from the tree and a moonlight stalk. Such an act in ground so open would have been that of a stark staring lunatic, and that I should even have been contemplating it will show you the condition of my mind. But everything comes to him who knows how to wait, and sometimes too to him who doesn\u2019t, and so at last those elephants, or rather one of them, came to me.\n\nAfter they had fed their fill, which was a very large one, the noble three stood once more in line some seventy yards to the left of the hut, and on the edge of the cultivated lands, or in all about eighty-five yards from where I was perched. Then at last the one with a single tusk made a peculiar rattling noise in his trunk, just as though he were blowing his nose, and without more ado began to walk deliberately toward the hut where the old woman slept. I made my rifle ready and glanced up at the moon, only to discover that a new complication was looming in the immediate future. I have said that a wind rose with the moon. Well, the wind brought rain-clouds along its track. Several light ones had already lessened the light for a little while, though without obscuring it, and now two more were coming up rapidly, both of them very black and dense. The first cloud was small and long, and the one behind big and broad. I remember noticing that the pair of them bore a most comical resemblance to a dray drawn by a very long raw-boned horse. As luck would have it, just as the elephant arrived within twenty-five yards or so of me, the head of the horse-cloud floated over the face of the moon, rendering it impossible for me to fire. In the faint twilight which remained, however, I could just make out the gray mass of the great brute still advancing towards the hut. Then the light went altogether and I had to trust to my ears. I heard him fumbling with his trunk, apparently at the roof of the hut; next came a sound as of straw being drawn out, and then for a little while there was complete silence.\n\nThe cloud began to pass; I could see the outline of the elephant; he was standing with his head quite over the top of the hut. But I could not see his trunk, and no wonder, for it was _inside the hut_. He had thrust it through the roof, and, attracted no doubt by the smell of the mealies, was groping about with it inside. It was growing light now, and I got my rifle ready, when suddenly there was a most awful yell, and I saw the trunk reappear, and in its mighty fold the old woman who had been sleeping in the hut. Out she came through the hole like a periwinkle on the point of a pin, still wrapped up in her blanket, and with her skinny arms and legs stretched to the four points of the compass, and as she did so, gave that most alarming screech. I really don\u2019t know who was the most frightened, she, or I, or the elephant. At any rate the last was considerably startled; he had been fishing for mealies\u2014the old woman was a mere accident, and one that greatly discomposed his nerves. He gave a sort of trumpet, and threw her away from him right into the crown of a low mimosa tree, where she stuck shrieking like a metropolitan engine. The old bull lifted his tail, and flapping his great ears prepared for flight. I put up my eight-bore, and aiming hastily at the point of his shoulder (for he was broadside on), I fired. The report rang out like thunder, making a thousand echoes in the quiet hills. I saw him go down all of a heap as though he were stone dead. Then, alas! whether it was the kick of the heavy rifle, or the excited bump of that idiot Gobo, or both together, or merely an unhappy coincidence, I do not know, but the rotten beam broke and I went down too, landing flat at the foot of the tree upon a certain humble portion of the human frame. The shock was so severe that I felt as though all my teeth were flying through the roof of my mouth, but although I sat slightly stunned for a few seconds, luckily for me I fell light, and was not in any way injured.\n\nMeanwhile the elephant began to scream with fear and fury, and, attracted by his cries, the other two charged up. I felt for my rifle; it was not there. Then I remembered that I had rested it on a fork of the bough in order to fire, and doubtless there it remained. My position was now very unpleasant. I did not dare to try and climb the tree again, which, shaken as I was, would have been a task of some difficulty, because the elephants would certainly see me, and Gobo, who had clung to a bough, was still aloft with the other rifle. I could not run because there was no shelter near. Under these circumstances I did the only thing feasible, clambered round the trunk as softly as possible, and keeping one eye on the elephants, whispered to Gobo to bring down the rifle, and awaited the development of the situation. I knew that if the elephants did not see me\u2014which, luckily, they were too enraged to do\u2014they would not smell me, for I was up-wind. Gobo, however, either did not, or, preferring the safety of the tree, would not hear me. He said the former, but I believed the latter, for I knew that he was not enough of a sportsman to really enjoy shooting elephants by moonlight in the open. So there I was behind my tree, dismayed, unarmed, but highly interested, for I was witnessing a remarkable performance.\n\nWhen the two other bulls arrived the wounded elephant on the ground ceased to scream, but began to make a low moaning noise, and to gently touch the wound near his shoulder, from which the blood was literally spouting. The other two seemed to understand; at any rate, they did this. Kneeling down on either side, they placed their trunks and tusks underneath him, and, aided by his own efforts, with one great lift got him on to his feet. Then leaning against him on either side to support him, they marched off at a walk in the direction of the village.[*] It was a pitiful sight, and even then it made me feel a brute.\n\n[*] The Editor would have been inclined to think that in relating this incident Mr. Quatermain was making himself interesting at the expense of the exact truth, did it not happen that a similar incident has come within his knowledge.\u2014Editor.\n\n\nPresently, from a walk, as the wounded elephant gathered himself together a little, they broke into a trot, and after that I could follow them no longer with my eyes, for the second black cloud came up over the moon and put her out, as an extinguisher puts out a dip. I say with my eyes, but my ears gave me a very fair notion of what was going on. When the cloud came up the three terrified animals were heading directly for the kraal, probably because the way was open and the path easy. I fancy that they grew confused in the darkness, for when they came to the kraal fence they did not turn aside, but crashed straight through it. Then there were \u2018times,\u2019 as the Irish servant-girl says in the American book. Having taken the fence, they thought that they might as well take the kraal also, so they just ran over it. One hive-shaped hut was turned quite over on to its top, and when I arrived upon the scene the people who had been sleeping there were bumbling about inside like bees disturbed at night, while two more were crushed flat, and a third had all its side torn out. Oddly enough, however, nobody was hurt, though several people had a narrow escape of being trodden to death.\u201d",
    "\u201cBefore dawn on the following day we were up, and the first break of light found us once more on the spoor. About half-past five o\u2019clock we reached the place where the elephants had fed and slept. The two unwounded bulls had taken their fill, as the condition of the neighbouring bushes showed, but the wounded one had eaten nothing. He had spent the night leaning against a good-sized tree, which his weight had pushed out of the perpendicular. They had not long left this place, and could not be very far ahead, especially as the wounded bull was now again so stiff after his night\u2019s rest that for the first few miles the other two had been obliged to support him. But elephants go very quick, even when they seem to be travelling slowly, for shrub and creepers that almost stop a man\u2019s progress are no hindrance to them. The three had now turned to the left, and were travelling back again in a semicircular line toward the mountains, probably with the idea of working round to their old feeding grounds on the further side of the river.\n\nThere was nothing for it but to follow their lead, and accordingly we followed with industry. Through all that long hot day did we tramp, passing quantities of every sort of game, and even coming across the spoor of other elephants. But, in spite of my men\u2019s entreaties, I would not turn aside after these. I would have those mighty tusks or none.\n\nBy evening we were quite close to our game, probably within a quarter of a mile, but the bush was dense, and we could see nothing of them, so once more we must camp, thoroughly disgusted with our luck. That night, just after the moon rose, while I was sitting smoking my pipe with my back against a tree, I heard an elephant trumpet, as though something had startled it, and not three hundred yards away. I was very tired, but my curiosity overcame my weariness, so, without saying a word to any of the men, all of whom were asleep, I took my eight-bore and a few spare cartridges, and steered toward the sound. The game path which we had been following all day ran straight on in the direction from which the elephant had trumpeted. It was narrow, but well trodden, and the light struck down upon it in a straight white line. I crept along it cautiously for some two hundred yards, when it opened suddenly into a most beautiful glade some hundred yards or more in width, wherein tall grass grew and flat-topped trees stood singly. With the caution born of long experience I watched for a few moments before I entered the glade, and then I saw why the elephant had trumpeted. There in the middle of the glade stood a large maned lion. He stood quite still, making a soft purring noise, and waving his tail to and fro. Presently the grass about forty yards on the hither side of him gave a wide ripple, and a lioness sprang out of it like a flash, and bounded noiselessly up to the lion. Reaching him, the great cat halted suddenly, and rubbed her head against his shoulder. Then they both began to purr loudly, so loudly that I believe that in the stillness one might have heard them two hundred yards or more away.\n\nAfter a time, while I was still hesitating what to do, either they got a whiff of my wind, or they wearied of standing still, and determined to start in search of game. At any rate, as though moved by a common impulse, they bounded suddenly away, leap by leap, and vanished in the depths of the forest to the left. I waited for a little while longer to see if there were any more yellow skins about, and seeing none, came to the conclusion that the lions must have frightened the elephants away, and that I had taken my stroll for nothing. But just as I was turning back I thought that I heard a bough break upon the further side of the glade, and, rash as the act was, I followed the sound. I crossed the glade as silently as my own shadow. On its further side the path went on. Albeit with many fears, I went on too. The jungle growth was so thick here that it almost met overhead, leaving so small a passage for the light that I could scarcely see to grope my way along. Presently, however, it widened, and then opened into a second glade slightly smaller than the first, and there, on the further side of it, about eighty yards from me, stood the three enormous elephants.\n\nThey stood thus:\u2014Immediately opposite and facing me was the wounded one-tusked bull. He was leaning his bulk against a dead thorn-tree, the only one in the place, and looked very sick indeed. Near him stood the second bull as though keeping a watch over him. The third elephant was a good deal nearer to me and broadside on. While I was still staring at them, this elephant suddenly walked off and vanished down a path in the bush to the right.\n\nThere are now two things to be done\u2014either I could go back to the camp and advance upon the elephants at dawn, or I could attack them at once. The first was, of course, by far the wiser and safer course. To engage one elephant by moonlight and single-handed is a sufficiently rash proceeding; to tackle three was little short of lunacy. But, on the other hand, I knew that they would be on the march again before daylight, and there might come another day of weary trudging before I could catch them up, or they might escape me altogether.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 I thought to myself, \u2018faint heart never won fair tusk. I\u2019ll risk it, and have a slap at them. But how?\u2019 I could not advance across the open, for they would see me; clearly the only thing to do was to creep round in the shadow of the bush and try to come upon them so. So I started. Seven or eight minutes of careful stalking brought me to the mouth of the path down which the third elephant had walked. The other two were now about fifty yards from me, and the nature of the wall of bush was such that I could not see how to get nearer to them without being discovered. I hesitated, and peeped down the path which the elephant had followed. About five yards in, it took a turn round a shrub. I thought that I would just have a look behind it, and advanced, expecting that I should be able to catch a sight of the elephant\u2019s tail. As it happened, however, I met his trunk coming round the corner. It is very disconcerting to see an elephant\u2019s trunk when you expect to see his tail, and for a moment I stood paralyzed almost under the vast brute\u2019s head, for he was not five yards from me. He too halted, threw up his trunk and trumpeted preparatory to a charge. I was in for it now, for I could not escape either to the right or left, on account of the bush, and I did not dare turn my back. So I did the only thing that I could do\u2014raised the rifle and fired at the black mass of his chest. It was too dark for me to pick a shot; I could only brown him, as it were.\n\nThe shot rung out like thunder on the quiet air, and the elephant answered it with a scream, then dropped his trunk and stood for a second or two as still as though he had been cut in stone. I confess that I lost my head; I ought to have fired my second barrel, but I did not. Instead of doing so, I rapidly opened my rifle, pulled out the old cartridge from the right barrel and replaced it. But before I could snap the breech to, the bull was at me. I saw his great trunk fly up like a brown beam, and I waited no longer. Turning, I fled for dear life, and after me thundered the elephant. Right into the open glade I ran, and then, thank Heaven, just as he was coming up with me the bullet took effect on him. He had been shot right through the heart, or lungs, and down he fell with a crash, stone dead.\u201d",
    "\u201cAt last,\u201d he went on, \u201ca few minutes before sunset, the task was finished. We had laboured at it all day, stopping only once for dinner, for it is no easy matter to hew out five such tusks as those which now lay before me in a white and gleaming line. It was a dinner worth eating, too, I can tell you, for we dined off the heart of the great one-tusked bull, which was so big that the man whom I sent inside the elephant to look for his heart was forced to remove it in two pieces.\nWe cut it into slices and fried it with fat, and I never tasted heart to equal it, for the meat seemed to melt in one\u2019s mouth. By the way, I examined the jaw of the elephant; it never grew but one tusk; the other had not been broken off, nor was it present in a rudimentary form.\n\nWell, there lay the five beauties, or rather four of them, for Gobo and another man were engaged in sawing the grand one in two. At last with many sighs I ordered them to do this, but not until by practical experiment I had proved that it was impossible to carry it in any other way. One hundred and sixty pounds of solid ivory, or rather more in its green state, is too great a weight for two men to bear for long across a broken country. I sat watching the job and smoking the pipe of contentment, when suddenly the bush opened, and a very handsome and dignified native girl, apparently about twenty years of age, stood before me, carrying a basket of green mealies upon her head.\n\nAlthough I was rather surprised to see a native girl in such a wild spot, and, so far as I knew, a long way from any kraal, the matter did not attract my particular notice; I merely called to one of the men, and told him to bargain with the woman for the mealies, and ask her if there were any more to be bought in the neighbourhood. Then I turned my head and continued to superintend the cutting of the tusk. Presently a shadow fell upon me. I looked up, and saw that the girl was standing before me, the basket of mealies still on her head.\n\n\u2018Mar\u00eame, Mar\u00eame,\u2019 she said, gently clapping her hands together. The word Mar\u00eame among these Matuku (though she was no Matuku) answers to the Zulu \u2018Koos,\u2019 and the clapping of hands is a form of salutation very common among the tribes of the Basutu race.\n\n\u2018What is it, girl?\u2019 I asked her in Sisutu. \u2018Are those mealies for sale?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, great white hunter,\u2019 she answered in Zulu, \u2018I bring them as a gift.\u2019\n\n\u2018Good,\u2019 I replied; \u2018set them down.\u2019\n\n\u2018A gift for a gift, white man.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 I grumbled, \u2018the old story\u2014nothing for nothing in this wicked world. What do you want\u2014beads?\u2019\n\nShe nodded, and I was about to tell one of the men to go and fetch some from one of the packs, when she checked me.\n\n\u2018A gift from the giver\u2019s own hand is twice a gift,\u2019 she said, and I thought that she spoke meaningly.\n\n\u2018You mean that you want me to give them to you myself?\u2019\n\n\u2018Surely.\u2019\n\nI rose to go with her. \u2018How is it that, being of the Matuku, you speak in the Zulu tongue?\u2019 I asked suspiciously.\n\n\u2018I am not of the Matuku,\u2019 she answered as soon as we were out of hearing of the men. \u2018I am of the people of Nala, whose tribe is the Butiana tribe, and who lives there,\u2019 and she pointed over the mountain. \u2018Also I am one of the wives of Wambe,\u2019 and her eyes flashed as she said the name.\n\n\u2018And how did you come here?\u2019\n\n\u2018On my feet,\u2019 she answered laconically.\n\nWe reached the packs, and undoing one of them, I extracted a handful of beads. \u2018Now,\u2019 I said, \u2018a gift for a gift. Hand over the mealies.\u2019\n\nShe took the beads without even looking at them, which struck me as curious, and setting the basket of mealies on the ground, emptied it.\n\nAt the bottom of the basket were some curiously-shaped green leaves, rather like the leaves of the gutta-percha tree in shape, only somewhat thicker and of a more fleshy substance. As though by hazard, the girl picked one of these leaves out of the basket and smelt it. Then she handed it to me. I took the leaf, and supposing that she wished me to smell it also, was about to oblige her by doing so, when my eye fell upon some curious red scratches on the green surface of the leaf.\n\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said the girl (whose name, by the way, was Maiwa), speaking beneath her breath, \u2018read the signs, white man.\u2019\n\nWithout answering her I continued to stare at the leaf. It had been scratched or rather written upon with a sharp tool, such as a nail, and wherever this instrument had touched it, the acid juice oozing through the outer skin had turned a rusty blood colour. Presently I found the beginning of the scrawl, and read this in English, and covering the surface of the leaf and of two others that were in the basket.\n\n\u2018I hear that a white man is hunting in the Matuku country. This is to warn him to fly over the mountain to Nala. Wambe sends an impi at daybreak to eat him up, because he has hunted before bringing hongo. For God\u2019s sake, whoever you are, try to help me. I have been the slave of this devil Wambe for nearly seven years, and am beaten and tortured continually. He murdered all the rest of us, but kept me because I could work iron. Maiwa, his wife, takes this; she is flying to Nala her father because Wambe killed her child. Try to get Nala to attack Wambe; Maiwa can guide them over the mountain. You won\u2019t come for nothing, for the stockade of Wambe\u2019s private kraal is made of elephants\u2019 tusks. For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t desert me, or I shall kill myself. I can bear this no longer.\n\n\u2018John Every.\u2019\n\n\u2018Great heavens!\u2019 I gasped. \u2018Every!\u2014why, it must be my old friend.\u2019 The girl, or rather the woman Maiwa, pointed to the other side of the leaf, where there was more writing. It ran thus\u2014\u2018I have just heard that the white man is called Macumazahn. If so, it must be my friend Quatermain. Pray Heaven it is, for I know he won\u2019t desert an old chum in such a fix as I am. It isn\u2019t that I\u2019m afraid of dying, I don\u2019t care if I die, but I want to get a chance at Wambe first.\u2019\n\n\u2018No, old boy,\u2019 thought I to myself, \u2018it isn\u2019t likely that I am going to leave you there while there is a chance of getting you out. I have played fox before now\u2014there\u2019s still a double or two left in me. I must make a plan, that\u2019s all. And then there\u2019s that stockade of tusks. I am not going to leave that either.\u2019 Then I spoke to the woman.\u201d",
    "\u201cThen we started, Maiwa guiding us. After going for a half-hour over gradually rising ground, we found ourselves on the further edge of a great bush-clad depression something like the bottom of a lake. This depression, through which we had been travelling, was covered with bush to a very great extent, indeed almost altogether so, except where it was pitted with glades such as that wherein I had shot the elephants. At the top of this slope Maiwa halted, and putting her hand over her eyes looked back. Presently she touched me on the arm and pointed across the sea of forest towards a comparatively vacant space of country some six or seven miles away. I looked, and suddenly I saw something flash in the red rays of the setting sun. A pause, and then another quick flash.\n\n\u201c\u2018What is it?\u2019 I asked.\n\n\u201c\u2018It is the spears of Wambe\u2019s impi, and they travel fast,\u2019 she answered coolly.\n\n\u201cI suppose that my face showed how little I liked the news, for she went on\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2018Fear not; they will stay to feast upon the elephants, and while they feast we shall journey. We may yet escape.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter that we turned and pushed on again, till at length it grew so dark that we had to wait for the rising of the moon, which lost us time, though it gave us rest. Fortunately none of the men had seen that ominous flashing of the spears; if they had, I doubt if even I could have kept control of them. As it was, they travelled faster than I had ever known loaded natives to go before, so thorough-paced was their desire to see the last of Wambe\u2019s country. I, however, took the precaution to march last of all, fearing lest they should throw away their loads to lighten themselves, or, worse still, the tusks; for these kind of fellows would be capable of throwing anything away if their own skins were at stake. If the pious \u00c6neas, whose story you were reading to me the other night, had been a mongrel Delagoa Bay native, Anchises would have had a poor chance of getting out of Troy, that is, if he was known to have made a satisfactory will.\n\n\u201cAt moonrise we set out again, and with short occasional halts travelled till dawn, when we were forced to rest and eat. Starting once more, about half-past five, we crossed the river at noon. Then began the long toilsome ascent through thick bush, the same in which I shot the bull buffalo, only some twenty miles to the west of that spot, and not more than twenty-five miles on the hither side of Wambe\u2019s kraal. There were six or seven miles of this dense bush, and hard work it was to get through it. Next came a belt of scattered forest which was easier to pass, though, in revenge, the ground was steeper. This was about two miles wide, and we passed it by about four in the afternoon. Above this scattered bush lay a long steep slope of boulder-strewn ground, which ran up to the foot of the little peak some three miles away. As we emerged, footsore and weary, on to this inhospitable plain, some of the men looking round caught sight of the spears of Wambe\u2019s impi advancing rapidly not more than a mile behind us.\n\n\u201cAt first there was a panic, and the bearers tried to throw off their loads and run, but I harangued them, calling out to them that certainly I would shoot the first man who did so and that if they would but trust in me I would bring them through the mess. Now, ever since I had killed those three elephants single-handed, I had gained great influence over these men, and they listened to me. So off we went as hard as ever we could go\u2014the members of the Alpine Club would not have been in it with us. We made the boulders burn, as a Frenchman would say.\n\n\u201cWhen we had done about a mile the spears began to emerge from the belt of scattered bush, and the whoop of their bearers as they viewed us broke upon our ears. Quick as our pace had been before, it grew much quicker now, for terror lent wings to my gallant crew. But they were sorely tired, and the loads were heavy, so that run, or rather climb, as we would, Wambe\u2019s soldiers, a scrubby-looking lot of men armed with big spears and small shields, but without plumes, climbed considerably faster. The last mile of that pleasing chase was like a fox hunt, we being the fox, and always in view. What astonished me was the extraordinary endurance and activity shown by Maiwa. She never even flagged. I think that girl\u2019s muscles must have been made of iron, or perhaps it was the strength of her will that supported her. At any rate she reached the foot of the peak second, poor Gobo, who was an excellent hand at running away, being first.\n\n\u201cPresently I came up panting, and glanced at the ascent. Before us was a wall of rock about one hundred and fifty feet in height, upon which the strata were laid so as to form a series of projections sufficiently resembling steps to make the ascent easy, comparatively speaking, except at one spot, where it was necessary to climb over a projecting angle of cliff and bear a little to the left. It was not a really difficult place, but what made it awkward was, that immediately beneath this projection gaped a deep fissure or donga, on the brink of which we now stood, originally dug out, no doubt, by the rush of water from the peak and cliff. This gulf beneath would be trying to the nerves of a weak-headed climber at the critical point, and so it proved in the result. The projecting angle once passed, the remainder of the ascent was very simple. At the summit, however, the brow of the cliff hung over and was pierced by a single narrow path cut through it by water, in such fashion that a single boulder rolled into it at the top would make the cliff quite impassable to men without ropes.\u201d",
    "\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 I said, when she had done, \u2018and now as to this secret path of thine\u2014knowest thou aught of it?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Ay,\u2019 she answered, \u2018I am no fool, Macumazahn. Knowledge learned is power earned. I won the secret of that path.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And canst thou guide an impi thereon so that it shall fall upon the town from behind?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, I can do this, if only Wambe\u2019s people know not that the impi comes, for if they know, then they can block the way.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018So then here is my plan. Listen, Nala, and say if it be good, or if thou hast a better, show it forth. Let messengers go out and summon all thy impi, that it be gathered here on the third day from now. This being done, let the impi, led by Maiwa, march on the morrow of the fourth day, and crossing the mountains let it travel along on the other side of the mountains till it come to the place on the further side of which is the kraal of Wambe; that shall be some three days\u2019 journey in all.[*] Then on the night of the third day\u2019s journey, let Maiwa lead the impi in silence up the secret path, so that it comes to the crest of the mountain that is above the strong place, and here let it hide among the rocks.\n\n[*] About one hundred and twenty miles.\u2014Editor.\n\n\u201c\u2018Meanwhile on the sixth day from now let one of thy Indunas, Nala, bring with him two hundred men that have guns, and lead me and my men as prisoners, and take also a girl from among the Butiana people, who by form and face is like unto Maiwa, and bind her hands, and pass by the road on which we came and through the cutting in the cliff on to the kraal of Wambe. But the men shall take no shields or plumes with them, only their guns and one short spear, and when they meet the people of Wambe they shall say that they come to give up the woman and the white man and his party to Wambe, and to make atonement to Wambe. So shall they pass in peace. And travelling thus, on the evening of the seventh day we shall come to the gates of the place of Wambe, and nigh the gates there is, so says Maiwa, a koppie very strong and full of rocks and caves, but having no soldiers on it except in time of war, or at the worst but a few such as can easily be overpowered.\n\n\u201c\u2018This being done, at the dawn of day the impi on the mountain behind the town must light a fire and put wet grass on it, so that the smoke goes up. Then at the sight of the smoke we in the koppie will begin to shoot into the town of Wambe, and all the soldiers will run to kill us. But we will hold our own, and while we fight the impi shall charge down the mountain side and climb the schanses, and put those who defend them to the assegai, and then falling upon the town shall surprise it, and drive the soldiers of Wambe as a wind blows the dead husks of corn. This is my plan. I have spoken.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018_Ou!_\u2019 said Nala, \u2018it is good, it is very good. The white man is cleverer than a jackal. Yes, so shall it be; and may the snake of the Butiana people stand up upon its tail and prosper the war, for so shall we be rid of Wambe and the tyrannies of Wambe.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter that the girl Maiwa stood up, and once more producing the dreadful little dried hand, made her father and several of his head councillors swear by it and upon it that they would carry out the war of vengeance to the bitter end. It was a very curious sight to see. And by the way, the fight that ensued was thereafter known among the tribes of that district as the War of the Little Hand.\n\n\u201cThe next two days were busy ones for us. Messengers were sent out, and every available man of the Butiana tribe was ordered up to \u2018a great dance.\u2019 The country was small, and by the evening of the second day, some twelve hundred and fifty men were assembled with their assegais and shields, and a fine hardy troop they were. At dawn of the following day, the fourth from the departure of the heralds, the main impi, having been doctored in the usual fashion, started under the command of Nala himself, who, knowing that his life and chieftainship hung upon the issue of the struggle, wisely determined to be present to direct it. With them went Maiwa, who was to guide them up the secret path. Of course we were obliged to give them two days\u2019 start, as they had more than a hundred miles of rough country to pass, including the crossing of the great mountain range which ran north and south, for it was necessary that the impi should make a wide d\u00e9tour in order to escape detection.\u201d",
    "\u201cAt length the night wore away, and with the first tinge of light I began to go my rounds, and stumbling along the stony paths, to make things as ready as I could for the attack, which I felt sure would be delivered before we were two hours older. The men were cramped and cold, and consequently low-spirited, but I exhorted them to the best of my ability, bidding them remember the race from which they sprang, and not to show the white feather before a crowd of Matuku dogs. At length it began to grow light, and presently I saw long columns of men advancing towards the koppie. They halted under cover at a distance of about a hundred and fifty yards, and just as the dawn broke a herald came forward and called to us. Our captain stood up upon a rock and answered him.\n\n\u201c\u2018These are the words of Wambe,\u2019 the herald said. \u2018Come forth from the koppie, and give over the evil-doers, and go in peace, or stay in the koppie and be slain.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018It is too early to come out as yet,\u2019 answered our man in fine diplomatic style. \u2018When the sun sucks up the mist then we will come out. Our limbs are stiff with cold.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Come forth even now,\u2019 said the herald.\n\n\u201c\u2018Not if I know it, my boy,\u2019 said I to myself; but the captain replied that he would come out when he thought proper, and not before.\n\n\u201c\u2018Then make ready to die,\u2019 said the herald, for all the world like the villain of a transpontine piece, and majestically stalked back to the soldiers.\n\n\u201cI made my final arrangements, and looked anxiously at the mountain crest a couple of miles or so away, from which the mist was now beginning to lift, but no column of smoke could I see. I whistled, for if the attacking force had been delayed or made any mistake, our position was likely to grow rather warm. We had barely enough water to wet the mouths of the men, and when once it was finished we could not hold the place for long in that burning heat.\n\n\u201cAt length, just as the sun rose in glory over the heights behind us, the Matuku soldiers, of whom about fifteen hundred were now assembled, set up a queer whistling noise, which ended in a chant. Then some shots were fired, for the Matuku had a few guns, but without effect, though one bullet passed just by a man\u2019s head.\n\n\u201c\u2018Now they are going to begin,\u2019 I thought to myself, and I was not far wrong, for in another minute the body of men divided into three companies, each about five hundred strong, and, heralded by a running fire, charged at us on three sides. Our men were now all well under cover, and the fire did us no harm. I mounted on a rock so as to command a view of as much of the koppie and plain as possible, and yelled to our men to reserve their fire till I gave the word, and then to shoot low and load as quickly as possible. I knew that, like all natives, they were sure to be execrable shots, and that they were armed with weapons made out of old gas-pipes, so the only chance of doing execution was to let the enemy get right on to us.\n\n\u201cOn they came with a rush; they were within eighty yards now, and as they drew near the point of attack, I observed that they closed their ranks, which was so much the better for us.\n\n\u201c\u2018Shall we not fire, my father?\u2019 sung out the captain.\n\n\u201c\u2018No, confound you!\u2019 I answered.\n\n\u201c\u2018Sixty yards\u2014fifty\u2014forty\u2014thirty. Fire, you scoundrels!\u2019 I yelled, setting the example by letting off both barrels of my elephant gun into the thickest part of the company opposite to me.\n\n\u201cInstantly the place rang out with the discharge of two hundred and odd guns, while the air was torn by the passage of every sort of missile, from iron pot legs down to slugs and pebbles coated with lead. The result was very prompt. The Matukus were so near that we could not miss them, and at thirty yards a lead-coated stone out of a gas-pipe is as effective as a Martini rifle, or more so. Over rolled the attacking soldiers by the dozen, while the survivors, fairly frightened, took to their heels. We plied them with shot till they were out of range\u2014I made it very warm for them with the elephant gun, by the way\u2014and then we loaded up in quite a cheerful frame of mind, for we had not lost a man, whereas I could count more than fifty dead and wounded Matukus. The only thing that damped my ardour was that, stare as I would, I could see no column of smoke upon the mountain crest.\n\n\u201cHalf an hour elapsed before any further steps were taken against us. Then the attacking force adopted different tactics. Seeing that it was very risky to try to rush us in dense masses, they opened out into skirmishing order and ran across the open space in lots of five and six. As it happened, right at the foot of the koppie the ground broke away a little in such fashion that it was almost impossible for us to search it effectually with our fire. On the hither side of this dip Wambe\u2019s soldiers were now congregating in considerable numbers.\u201d",
    "a pressed them too close. But they got to the schanses or pits protected with stone walls, and constructed to hold from a dozen to twenty men, and soon began to open fire from them, and from isolated rocks. I turned my eyes to the gates of the town, which were placed to the north and south. Already they were crowded with hundreds of fugitive women and children flying to the rocks and caves for shelter from the foe.\n\n\u201cAs for ourselves, the appearance of Nala\u2019s impi produced a wonderful change for the better in our position. The soldiers attacking us turned, realizing that the town was being assailed from the rear, and clambering down the koppie streamed off to protect their homes against this new enemy. In five minutes there was not a man left except those who would move no more, or were too sorely wounded to escape. I felt inclined to ejaculate \u2018_Saved!_\u2019 like the gentleman in the play, but did not because the occasion was too serious. What I did do was to muster all the men and reckon up our losses. They amounted to fifty-one killed and wounded, sixteen men having been killed outright. Then I sent men with the cooking-pots to the stream of water, and we drank. This done I set my bearers, being the most useless part of the community, from a fighting point of view, to the task of attending the injured, and turned to watch the fray.\n\n\n\u201cBy this time Nala\u2019s impi had climbed the first line of fortifications without opposition, and was advancing in a long line upon the schanses or pits which were scattered about between it and the second line, singing a war chant as it came. Presently puffs of smoke began to start from the schanses, and with my glasses I could see several of our men falling over. Then as they came opposite a schanse that portion of the long line of warriors would thicken up and charge it with a wild rush. I could see them leap on to the walls and vanish into the depths beneath, some of their number falling backward on each occasion, shot or stabbed to death.\n\n\n\u201cNext would come another act in the tragedy. Out from the hither side of the schanse would pour such of its defenders as were left alive, perhaps three or four and perhaps a dozen, running for dear life, with the war dogs on their tracks. One by one they would be caught, then up flashed the great spear and down fell the pursued\u2014dead. I saw ten of our men leap into one large schanse, but though I watched for some time nobody came out. Afterwards we inspected the place and found these men all dead, together with twenty-three Matukus. Neither side would give in, and they had fought it out to the bitter end.\n\n\n\u201cAt last they neared the second line of fortifications, behind which the whole remaining Matuku force, numbering some two thousand men, was rapidly assembling. One little pause to get their breath, and Nala\u2019s men came at it with a rush and a long wild shout of \u2018_Bulala Matuku_\u2019 (kill the Matuku) that went right through me, thrilling every nerve. Then came an answering shout, and the sounds of heavy firing, and presently I saw our men retreating, somewhat fewer in numbers than they had advanced. Their welcome had been a warm one for the Matuku fight splendidly behind walls. This decided me that it was necessary to create a diversion; if we did not do so it seemed very probable that we should be worsted after all. I called to the captain of our little force, and rapidly put the position before him.\n\n\n\u201cSeeing the urgency of the occasion, he agreed with me that we must risk it, and in two minutes more, with the exception of my own men, whom I left to guard the wounded, we were trotting across the open space and through the deserted town towards the spot where the struggle was taking place, some seven hundred yards away. In six or eight minutes we reached a group of huts\u2014it was a head man\u2019s kraal, that was situated about a hundred and twenty yards behind the fortified wall, and took possession of it unobserved. The enemy was too much engaged with the foe in front of him to notice us, and besides, the broken ground rose in a hog-back shape between. There we waited a minute or two and recovered our breath, while I gave my directions. So soon as we heard the Butiana impi begin to charge again, we were to run out in a line to the brow of the hogback and pour our fire into the mass of defenders behind the wall. Then the guns were to be thrown down and we must charge with the assegai. We had no shields, but that could not be helped; there would be no time to reload the guns, and it was absolutely necessary that the enemy should be disconcerted at the moment when the main attack was delivered.\n\n\n\u201cThe men, who were as plucky a set of fellows as ever I saw, and whose blood was now thoroughly up, consented to this scheme, though I could see that they thought it rather a large order, as indeed I did myself. But I knew that if the impi was driven back a second time the game would be played, and for me at any rate it would be a case of the \u2018Thing that bites,\u2019 and this sure and certain knowledge filled my breast with valour.\n\n\n\u201cWe had not long to wait. Presently we heard the Butiana war-song swelling loud and long; they had commenced their attack. I made a sign, and the hundred and fifty men, headed by myself, poured out of the kraal, and getting into a rough line ran up the fifty or sixty yards of slope that intervened between ourselves and the crest of the hog-backed ridge. In thirty seconds we were there, and immediately beyond us was the main body of the Matuku host waiting the onslaught of the enemy with guns and spears.\"",
    "Even now they did not see us, so intent were they upon the coming attack. I signed to my men to take careful aim, and suddenly called out to them to fire, which they did with a will, dropping thirty or forty Matukus.\n\n\u201c\u2018_Charge!_\u2019 I shouted, again throwing down my smoking rifle and drawing my revolver, an example which they followed, snatching up their spears from the ground where they had placed them while they fired. The men set up a savage whoop, and we started. I saw the Matuku soldiers wheel around in hundreds, utterly taken aback at this new development of the situation. And looking over them, before we had gone twenty yards I saw something else. For of a sudden, as though they had risen from the earth, there appeared above the wall hundreds of great spears, followed by hundreds of savage faces shadowed with drooping plumes. With a yell they sprang upon the wall shaking their broad shields, and with a yell they bounded from it straight into our astonished foes.\n\n\n\u201c_Crash!_ we were in them now, and fighting like demons. _Crash!_ from the other side. Nala\u2019s impi was at its work, and still the spears and plumes appeared for a moment against the brown background of the mountain, and then sprang down and rushed like a storm upon the foe. The great mob of men turned this way and turned that way, astonished, bewildered, overborne by doubt and terror.\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile the slayers stayed not their hands, and on every side spears flashed, and the fierce shout of triumph went up to heaven. There too on the wall stood Maiwa, a white garment streaming from her shoulders, an assegai in her hand, her breast heaving, her eyes flashing. Above all the din of battle I could catch the tones of her clear voice as she urged the soldiers on to victory. But victory was not yet. Wambe\u2019s soldiers gathered themselves together, and bore our men back by the sheer weight of numbers. They began to give, then once more they rallied, and the fight hung doubtfully.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Slay, you war-whelps,\u2019 cried Maiwa from the wall. \u2018Are you afraid, you women, you chicken-hearted women! Strike home, or die like dogs! What\u2014you give way! Follow me, children of Nala.\u2019 And with one long cry she leapt from the wall as leaps a stricken antelope, and holding the spear poised rushed right into the thickest of the fray. The warriors saw her, and raised such a shout that it echoed like thunder against the mountains. They massed together, and following the flutter of her white robe crashed into the dense heart of the foe. Down went the Matuku before them like trees before a whirlwind. Nothing could stand in the face of such a rush as that. It was as the rush of a torrent bursting its banks. All along their line swept the wild desperate charge; and there, straight in the forefront of the battle, still waved the white robe of Maiwa.\n\n\n\u201cThen they broke, and, stricken with utter panic, Wambe\u2019s soldiers streamed away a scattered crowd of fugitives, while after them thundered the footfall of the victors.\n\n\n\u201cThe fight was over, we had won the day; and for my part I sat down upon a stone and wiped my forehead, thanking Providence that I had lived to see the end of it. Twenty minutes later Nala\u2019s warriors began to return panting. \u2018Wambe\u2019s soldiers had taken to the bush and the caves,\u2019 they said, \u2018where they had not thought it safe to follow them,\u2019 adding significantly, that many had stopped on the way.\n\n\n\u201cI was utterly dazed, and now that the fight was over my energy seemed to have left me, and I did not pay much attention, till presently I was aroused by somebody calling me by my name. I looked up, and saw that it was the chief Nala himself, who was bleeding from a flesh wound in his arm. By his side stood Maiwa panting, but unhurt, and wearing on her face a proud and terrifying air.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018They are gone, Macumazahn,\u2019 said the chief; \u2018there is little to fear from them, their heart is broken. But where is Wambe the chief?\u2014and where is the white man thou camest to save?\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018I know not,\u2019 I answered.\"",
    "\u201cClose to where we stood lay a Matuku, a young man who had been shot through the fleshy part of the calf. It was a trifling wound, but it prevented him from running away.\n\n\u201c\u2018Say, thou dog,\u2019 said Nala, stalking up to him and shaking his red spear in his face, \u2018say, where is Wambe? Speak, or I slay thee. Was he with the soldiers?\u2019\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Nay, lord, I know not,\u2019 groaned the terrified man, \u2018he fought not with us; Wambe has no stomach for fighting. Perchance he is in his kraal yonder, or in the cave behind the kraal,\u2019 and he pointed to a small enclosure on the hillside, about four hundred yards to the right of where we were.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Let us go and see,\u2019 said Nala, summoning his soldiers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe impi formed up; alas, an hour before it had been stronger by a third than it was now. Then Nala detached two hundred men to collect and attend to the injured, and at my suggestion issued a stringent order that none of the enemy\u2019s wounded, and above all no women or children, were to be killed, as is the savage custom among African natives. On the contrary, they were to be allowed to send word to their women that they might come in to nurse them and fear nothing, for Nala made war upon Wambe the tyrant, and not on the Matuku tribe.\n\n\n\u201cThen we started with some four hundred men for the chief\u2019s kraal. Very soon we were there. It was, as I have said, placed against the mountain side, but within the fortified lines, and did not at all cover more than an acre and a half of ground. Outside was a tiny reed fence, within which, neatly arranged in a semi-circular line, stood the huts of the chief\u2019s principal wives. Maiwa of course knew every inch of the kraal, for she had lived in it, and led us straight to the entrance. We peeped through the gateway\u2014not a soul was to be seen. There were the huts and there was the clear open space floored with a concrete of lime, on which the sun beat fiercely, but nobody could we see or hear.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018The jackal has gone to earth,\u2019 said Maiwa; \u2018he will be in the cave behind his hut,\u2019 and she pointed with her spear towards another small and semi-circular enclosure, over which a large hut was visible, that had the cliff itself for a background. I stared at this fence; by George! it was true, it was entirely made of tusks of ivory planted in the ground with their points bending outwards. The smallest ones, though none were small, were placed nearest to the cliff on either side, but they gradually increased in size till they culminated in two enormous tusks, which, set up so that their points met, something in the shape of an inverted V, formed the gateway to the hut. I was dumbfounded with delight; and indeed, where is the elephant-hunter who would not be, if he suddenly saw five or six hundred picked tusks set up in a row, and only waiting for him to take them away? Of course the stuff was what is known as \u2018black\u2019 ivory; that is, the exterior of the tusks had become black from years or perhaps centuries of exposure to wind and weather, but I was certain that it would be none the worse for that. Forgetting the danger of the deed, in my excitement I actually ran right across the open space, and drawing my knife scratched vigorously at one of the great tusks to see how deep the damage might be. As I thought, it was nothing; there beneath the black covering gleamed the pure white ivory. I could have capered for joy, for I fear that I am very mercenary at heart, when suddenly I heard the faint echo of a cry for assistance. \u2018Help!\u2019 screamed a voice in the Sisutu dialect from somewhere behind the hut; \u2018help! they are murdering me.\u2019\n\n\n\u201c_I knew the voice_; it was John Every\u2019s. Oh, what a selfish brute was I! For the moment that miserable ivory had driven the recollection of him out of my head, and now\u2014perhaps it was too late.\n\n\n\u201cNala, Maiwa, and the soldiers had now come up. They too heard the voice and interpreted its tone, though they had not caught the words.\n\n\n\u201c\u2018This way,\u2019 cried Maiwa, and we started at a run, passing round the hut of Wambe. Behind was the narrow entrance to a cave. We rushed through it heedless of the danger of the ambush, and this is what we saw, though very confusedly at first, owing to the gloom.\""

  "Talbot Mundy -- Jimgrim and Allah's Peace": [
    "There is a beautiful belief that journalists may do exactly as they please, and whenever they please. Pleasure with violet eyes was in Chicago. My passport describes me as a journalist. My employer said: \"Go to Jerusalem.\" I went, that was in 1920.\n\nI had been there a couple of times before the World War, when the Turks were in full control. So I knew about the bedbugs and the stench of the citadel moat; the pre-war price of camels; enough Arabic to misunderstand it when spoken fluently, and enough of the Old Testament and the Koran to guess at Arabian motives, which are important, whereas words are usually such stuff as lies are made of.\n\nEl Kudz, as Arabs call Jerusalem, is, from a certain distance, as they also call it, shellabi kabir. Extremely beautiful. Beautiful upon a mountain. El Kudz means The City, and in a certain sense it is that, to unnumbered millions of people. Ludicrous, uproarious, dignified, pious, sinful, naively confidential, secretive, altruistic, realistic. Hoary-ancient and ultra-modern. Very, very proud of its name Jerusalem, which means City of Peace. Full to the brim with the malice of certainly fifty religions, fifty races, and five hundred thousand curious political chicaneries disguised as plans to save our souls from hell and fill some fellow's purse. The jails are full.\n\n\"Look for a man named Grim,\" said my employer. \"James Schuyler Grim, American, aged thirty-four or so. I've heard he knows the ropes.\"\n\nThe ropes, when I was in Jerusalem before the war, were principally used for hanging people at the Jaffa Gate, after they had been well beaten on the soles of their feet to compel them to tell where their money was hidden. The Turks entirely understood the arts of suppression and extortion, which they defined as government. The British, on the other hand, subject their normal human impulse to be greedy, and their educated craving to be gentlemanly white man's burden-bearers, to a process of compromise. Perhaps that isn't government. But it works. They even carry compromise to the point of not hanging even their critics if they can possibly avoid doing it. They had not yet, but they were about to receive a brand-new mandate from a brand-new League of Nations, awkwardly qualified by Mr. Balfour's post-Armistice promise to the Zionists to give the country to the Jews, and by a war-time promise, in which the French had joined, to create an Arab kingdom for the Arabs.\n\nSo there was lots of compromising being done, and hell to pay, with no one paying, except, of course, the guests in the hotels, at New York prices. The Zionist Jews were arriving in droves. The Arabs, who owned most of the land, were threatening to cut all the Jews' throats as soon as they could first get all their money. Feisal, a descendant of the Prophet, who had fought gloriously against the Turks, was romantically getting ready in Damascus to be crowned King of Syria. The French, who pride themselves on being realistic, were getting ready to go after Feisal with bayonets and poison-gas, as they eventually did.\n\nIn Jerusalem the Bolsheviks, astonishingly credulous of \"secret\" news from Moscow, and skeptical of every one's opinion but their own, were bolsheviking Marxian Utopia beneath a screen of such arrogant innocence that even the streetcorner police constables suspected them. And Mustapha Kemal, in Anatolia, was rumoured to be preparing a holy war. It was known as a Ghazi in those days. He had not yet scrapped religion. He was contemplating, so said rumour, a genuine old-fashioned moslem jihad, with modern trimmings.\n\nA few enthusiasts astonishingly still laboured for an American mandate. At the Holy Sepulchre a British soldier stood on guard with bayonet and bullets to prevent the priests of rival creeds from murdering one another. The sun shone and so did the stars. General Bols reopened Pontius Pilate's water-works. The learned monks in convents argued about facts and theories denied by archaeologists. Old-fashioned Jews wailed at the Wailing Wall. Tommy Atkins blasphemously dug corpses of donkeys and dogs from the Citadel moat.\n\nI arrived in the midst of all that, and spent a couple of months trying to make head or tail of it, and wondering, if that was peace, what war is? They say that wherever a man was ever slain in Palestine a flower grows. So one gets a fair idea of the country's mass-experience without much difficulty. For three months of the year, from end to end, the whole landscape is carpeted with flowers so close together that, except where beasts and men have trodden winding tracks, one can hardly walk without crushing an anemone or wild chrysanthemum. There are more battle-fields in that small land than all Europe can show. There are streams everywhere that historians assert repeatedly \"ran blood for days.\"\n\nFive thousand years of bloody terrorism, intermingling of races, piety, plunder, politics and pilgrims, have produced a self-consciousness as concentrated as liquid poison-gas. The laughter is sarcastic, the humour sardonic, and the credulity beyond analysis. For instance, when I got there, I heard the British being accused of \"imperialistic savagery\" because they had removed the leprous beggars from the streets into a clean place where they could receive medical treatment.\n\nIt was difficult to find one line of observation. Whatever anybody told you, was reversed entirely by the next man. The throat-distorting obligation to study Arabic called for rather intimate association with educated Arabs, whose main obsession was fear of the Zionist Jews. The things they said against the Jews turned me pro-Zionist. So I cautiously made the acquaintance of some gentlemen with gold-rimmed spectacles, and the things they said about the Arabs set me to sympathizing with the sons of Ishmael again.\n\nIn the midst of that predicament I met Jimgrim--Major James Schuyler Grim, to give him his full title, although hardly any one ever called him by it. After that, bewilderment began to cease as, under his amused, painstaking fingers, thread after thread of the involved gnarl of plots and politics betrayed its course.",
    "Two nights ago,\" he said, \"they gives me orders to take a Harab to a point near Jericho. After dark, I starts off, 'im on the back seat; engine ain't warm yet, so we goes slow. He leans forward after a couple o' minutes, an says 'Yalla kawam'! So I thinks to myself I'll show the blighter a thing or two, me not bein' used to takin' orders from no Harabs. Soon as the engine's 'ot I lets rip, an' you know now what the road's like. When we gets to the top o' that 'ill above Gethsemane I lets extry special rip. Thinks I, if you can stand what I can, my son, you've guts.\n\n\"Well, we 'its all the 'igh places, and lands on a bit o' level road just often enough to pick up more speed--comes round that sharp bend on 'alf a wheel, syme as I told you--kills three pye-dogs for sure, an' maybe others, but I don't dare look round--misses a camel in the dark that close that the 'air on my arms an' legs fair crawled up an' down me--'it's a lump o' rock that comes near tippin' us into the ditch--an' carries on faster an' ever. By the time we gets 'ere to Bethany, thinks I, it's time to take a look an' see if my passenger's still in the bloomin' car. So I slows down.\n\n\"The minute I turns my 'ead to 'ave a peer at 'im. 'Kawam!' 'e says. 'Quick! Quick!'\n\n\"So it strikes me I weren't in no such 'urry after all. Why 'urry for a Harab? The car's been rattlin' worse 'n a tinker's basket. I gets down to lave a look--lights a gasper--an' takes my bloomin' time about it. You seen them yellow curs there by Lazarus' tomb? Well, they come for me, yappin' an' snarlin' to beat 'ell. I'm pickin' up stones to break their 'eads with--good stones ain't such easy findin' in the dark, an' every time I stoops 'alf a dozen curs makes a rush for me--when what d'you suppose? That bloomin' Harab passenger o' mine vaults over into my seat, an' afore I could say ''ell's bells' 'e's off. I'd left the engine runnin'. By the luck o' the Lord I 'angs on, an' scrambles in--back seat.\n\n\"I thought at first I'd reach over an' get a half-nelson on 'im from behind. But, strike me blind! I didn't dare!\n\n\"Look where we are now. Can you see the 'air-pin turn at the bottom of this 'ill, with a ditch, beyond it? Well, we takes that turn in pitch-dark shadow with all four wheels in the air, an' you'd 'a thought we was a blinkin' airplane a doin' stunts. But 'e's a hexpert, 'e is, an' we 'olds the road. From there on we goes in one 'oly murderin' streak to a point about 'alf-way up the 'ill where the Inn of the Good Samaritan stands on top. There we 'as two blow-outs simultaneous, an' thinks I, now, my son, I've got you! I gets out.\n\n\"'You can drive,' I says, 'like Jehu son o' Nimshi what made Israel to sin. Let's see you make bricks now without no bleedin' straw'! I knew there weren't no tools under the seat--there never are in this 'ere country if you've left your car out o' your sight for five minutes. 'You take off them two back tires,' I says, 'while I sit 'ere an meditate on the ways of Harabs! Maybe you're Moses,' I says, 'an know 'ow to work a miracle.'\n\n\"But the only miracle about that bloke's 'is nerve. 'E gets out, 'an begins to walk straight on up'ill without as much as a by-your-leave. I shouts to 'im to come back. But 'e walks on. So I picks up a stone off the pile I was sittin' on, an' I plugs 'im good--'its 'im fair between the shoulder-blades. You'd think, if 'e was a Harab, that'ud bring 'im to 'is senses, wouldn't you? But what d'you suppose the blighter did?\n\n\"Did you notice my left eye when you got in the car? 'E turns back, an' thinks I, 'e's goin' to knife me. But that sport could use 'is fists, an' believe me, 'e done it! I can use 'em a bit myself, an' I starts in to knock 'is block off, but 'e puts it all over me--weight, reach an' science. Mind you, science! First Arab ever I see what 'ad science; an' I don't more than 'alf believe it now!\n\n\"Got to 'and it to 'im. 'E was merciful. 'E let up on me the minute 'e see I'd 'ad enough. 'E starts off up'ill again. I sits where 'e'd knocked me on to a stone pile, wishin' like 'ell for a drink. It was full moonlight, an' you could see for miles. After about fifteen minutes, me still meditatin' murder an' considerin' my thirst I seen 'em fetch a camel out o' the khan at the Inn o' the Good Samaritan; an' next thing you know, 'e's out o' sight. Thinks I, that's the last of 'im, an' good riddance! But not a bit of it!\n\n\"The men what fetched the camel for 'im comes down to me an' says the sheikh 'as left word I'm to be fed an' looked after. They fixes me up at the inn with a cot an' blankets an' a supper o' sorts, an' I lies awake listenin' to 'em talkin' Arabic, understandin' maybe one word out of six or seven. From what I can make o' their conjecturin', they think 'e ain't no sheikh at all, but a bloomin' British officer in disguise!\"",
    "We were not the only guests there. He ushered us into a square room, in which outrageous imported furniture, with gilt and tassels on it, stood out like loathsome sores against rugs and cushions fit for the great Haroun-al-Raschid's throne room. Any good museum in the world would have competed to possess the rugs, but the furniture was the sort that France sends eastward in the name of \"culture\"--stuff for \"savages\" to sit on and be civilized while the white man bears the burden and collects the money.\n\nThere were half-a-dozen Arabs reclining on two bastard Louis-something-or-other settees, who rose to their feet as we entered. There was another man, sitting on a cushion in a corner by himself, who did not get up. He wore a white head-dress exactly like our host's, and seemed to consider himself somebody very important indeed. After one swift searching glance at us he went into a brown study, as if a mere sheikh and a Christian alien were beneath his notice.\n\nWe were introduced first of all to the men who had stood up to greet us, and that ceremony took about five minutes. The Arab believes he ought to know all about how you feel physically, and expects you to reciprocate. When that was over ben Nazir took us to the corner and presented, first me, then Anazeh to the solitary man in the white head-dress, who seemed to think himself too important to trouble about manners.\n\nAnazeh did not quite like my receiving attention first, and he liked still less the off-handed way in which the solitary man received us. We were told his name was Suliman ben Saoud. He acknowledged my greeting. He and old Anazeh glared at each other, barely moving their heads in what might have been an unspoken threat and retort or a nod of natural recognition. Anazeh turned on his heel and joined the other guests.\n\nIn some vague way I knew that Saoud was a name to conjure with, although memory refused to place it. The man's air of indifference and apparently unstudied insolence suggested he was some one well used to authority. Presuming on the one thing that I felt quite sure of by that time--my privileged position as a guest--I stayed, to try to draw him out. I tried to open up conversation with him with English, French, and finally lame Arabic. He took no apparent notice of the French and English, but he smiled sarcastically at my efforts with his own tongue. Except that he moved his lips he made no answer but went on clicking the beads of a splendid amber rosary.\n\nBen Nazir, seeming to think that Anazeh's ruffled feelings called for smoothing, crossed the room to engage him in conversation, so I was left practically alone with the strange individual. More or less in a spirit of defiance of his claim to such distinction, I sat down on a cushion beside him.\n\nHe was a peculiar-looking man. The lower part of his cheek--that side on which I sat--was sunk in, as if he had no teeth there. The effect was to give his whole face a twisted appearance. The greater part of his head, of course, was concealed by the flowing white kaffiyi, but his skin was considerably darker than that of the Palestine Arab. He had no eyebrows at all, having shaved them off--for a vow I supposed. Instead of making him look comical, as you might expect, it gave him a very sinister appearance, which was increased by his generally surly attitude.\n\nOnce again, as when I had entered the room, he turned his head to give me one swift, minutely searching glance, and then turned his eyes away as if he had no further interest. They were quite extraordinary eyes, brimful of alert intelligence; and whereas from his general appearance I should have set him down at somewhere between forty and fifty, his eyes suggested youth, or else that keen, unpeaceful spirit that never ages.\n\nI tried him again in Arabic, but he answered without looking at me, in a dialect I had never heard before. So I offered him a gold-tipped cigarette, that being a universal language. He waived the offer aside with something between astonishment and disdain. He had lean, long-fingered hands, entirely unlike those of the desert fraternity, who live too hard and fight too frequently to have soft, uncalloused skin and unbroken finger-nails.\n\nHe did not exactly fascinate me. His self-containment was annoying. It seemed intended to convey an intellectual and moral importance that I was not disposed to concede without knowing more about him. I suppose an Arab feels the same sensation when a Westerner lords it over him on highly moral grounds. At any rate, something or other in the way of pique urged me to stir him out of his self-complacency, just as one feels urged to prod a bull-frog to watch him jump.\n\nHe seemed to understand my remarks, for he took no trouble to hide his amusement at my efforts with the language. But he only answered in monosyllables, and I could not understand those. So after about five minutes I gave it up, and crossed the room to ben Nazir, who seized the opportunity to show me my sleeping-quarters.",
    "So we smoked a cigarette together after the coffee, and then set forth on foot, for the distance was not great, preceded and surrounded by armed retainers. I imagine the armed men were more for the sake of appearance than protection. Ben Nazir seemed popular. But the escort drove other pedestrians out of the way as roughly as they did the unspeakable dogs that infested every offal-heap. The street that we followed was, of course, the open sewer for the houses on either hand, and its condition was a credit to the mangy curs that so resented our intrusion.\n\nAbdul Ali's house, if his it was, was a fairly big square building near the middle of the town. It did not look unlike one of the old-time New York precinct stations, with its big windows protected by iron grilles, and a flight of stone steps leading up to a door exactly in the middle of the front wall.\n\nThere were thirty or forty capable-looking men hanging about the place. Abdul Ali owned more than one camel caravan, and every man connected with the business looked on himself as a member of one big feudal family. They were all armed. Most of them had modern rifles.\n\nWe were admitted into a room that faced on the street, furnished entirely in the eastern style, except for two gilt chairs against the wall. The walls were hung with carpets and the floor was covered with Bokhara rugs three deep.\n\nNo doubt in order to emphasize his own importance, Abdul Ali kept us waiting in that room for ten minutes before he condescended to enter. But when he did come at last he was at pains to seem agreeable, which was not quite his natural attitude.\n\nI had never seen a more offensive personality, although at the first glance he did not arouse actual dislike. Distaste for him dawned, and grew. He was certainly not physically attractive, although the Syrian Arab costume made him picturesque. The first thing I noticed was the fatness of his hands--those of a giver of dishonest gifts. When he shook hands you felt in some subtle way that he was sure your conscience was for sale, that he would purchase it for any reasonable figure, and that he believed he had plenty of money with which to buy you and all your relatives.\n\nHe was a little puffy under the eyes, had a firm mouth, rather thick lips, and his small black moustache was turned up like the Kaiser's, which gave him a cockily self-assured appearance. For the rest, he was a rather military-looking person, although his flowing robe partly concealed that; stockily rather than heavily built; and of rather more than middle height. He wore one ring--a sapphire of extraordinary brilliance, of which he was immensely proud. When I noticed it he said at once that it had been given him by the late Sultan Abdul Hamid.\n\nHe spoke German from choice, so we conversed in German, which annoyed ben Nazir, who could not understand a word of it. And from first to last throughout that interview, and subsequently to the point where Jimgrim out-maneuvered and out-played him, he relied on the German philosophy of self-assertion that teaches how to get and keep the upper hand by making yourself believe in your own super-intelligence and then speaking, acting, making plans in logical accord with that belief. It works finely until somebody spoils the whole thing by pricking the super-intelligence bladder and letting out all the wind.\n\nAlthough he spoke German, he was not by any means pro-German in his motives. He was at pains to make that clear. Evidently he had been pro-German once, until he saw the writing on the wall. He was conscious of the need to offset past prejudices before suggesting his enormous ability along advanced lines.\n\n\"You come at an interesting time,\" he said. \"You find us in transition. Before the War, and almost until the end of it, most Arabs believed in the German destiny. English gold commanded the allegiance of an Arab army, but every last man in that army was ready to follow the German standard at the proper time. That only shows how ignorant these people are. As soon as it became evident that the Arab destiny lies in the hands of Arabs themselves most of them immediately began to clamour for an American mandate, because that would give them temporary masters who could protect them, yet at the same time who would be too ignorant of real conditions to prevent secret preparations for a pan-Arabian revolt. All very absurd, of course.\"\n\nHe had no idea how absurd he himself appeared. He launched into a tirade designed to make him seem a super-statesman in the eyes of a stranger who did not care what he was. The more he talked himself into a delirium of self-esteem the less his character impressed me. I even ran into the danger of under-estimating him because he liked himself so much.\n\n\"I'm here to look into the prospects for a school,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, yes. Very estimable. You shall have my support.\" He paused for me to fawn on him, and my neglect to do it spurred him to further self-revelation.\n\n\"You must look to me for support if you hope for success. There is no cohesion here without me. I am the only man in El-Kerak to whom they all listen, and even I have difficulty in uniting them at times. But a school is a good idea, and under my auspices you will succeed.\"\n\nFor the moment I thought he suspected me of wanting to teach school myself. I hastened to correct the impression:\n\n\"All I promise to do is to tell people in the States who might be interested.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" He had been coming at this point all along in his own way. \"So there is no hurry. It makes no difference that you must stay in El-Kerak a little longer than you intended. You shall be presented to the council of notables under my auspices. In my judgment it is important that you remain here for some little time.\"",
    "The wonderful thing about Moab is that everything happens in a story-book setting, with illustrations by Maxfield Parrish and Wyeth and Joe Coll, and all the rest of them, whichever way you look.\n\nImagine a blue sky--so clear-blue and pure that you can see against it the very feathers in the tails of wheeling kites, and know that they are brown, not black. Imagine all the houses, and the shacks between them, and the poles on which the burlap awnings hang, painted on flat canvas and stood up against that infinite blue. Stick some vultures in a row along a roof-top--purplish--bronze they'll look between the tiles and sky. Add yellow camels, gray horses, striped robes, long rifles, and a searching sun-dried smell. And there you have El-Kerak, from the inside.\n\nFrom any point along the broken walls or the castle roof you can see for fifty miles over scenery invented by the Master-Artist, with the Jordan like a blue worm in the midst of yellow-and-green hills twiggling into a turquoise sea.\n\nThe villains stalk on-stage and off again sublimely aware of their setting. The horses prance, the camels saunter, the very street-dogs compose themselves for a nap in the golden sun, all in perfect harmony with the piece. A woman walking with a stone jar on her head (or, just as likely, a kerosene can) looks as if she had just stepped out of eternity for the sake of the picture. And not all the kings and kaisers, cardinals and courtezans rolled into one great swaggering splurge of majesty could hold a candle to a ragged Bedouin chief on a flea-bitten pony, on the way to a small-town mejlis.\n\nSo it was worth a little inconvenience, and quite a little risk to see those chiefs arrive at the castle gate, toss their reins to a brother cut-throat, and swagger in, the poorest and least important timing their arrival, when they could, just in advance of an important man so as to take precedence of him and delay his entrance.\n\nMindful of my charge to keep Anazeh sober, and more deadly afraid of it than of all the other risks, I hung about waiting for him, hoping he would arrive before Abdul Ali or ben Nazir. I wanted to go inside and be seated before either of those gentry came. But not a bit of it. I saw Anazeh ride up at the head of his twenty men, halt at a corner, and ask a question. His men were in military order, and looked not only ready but anxious to charge the crowd and establish their old chief's importance.\n\nMahommed ben Hamza, not quite so smelly in his new clothes, was standing at my elbow.\n\n\"Sheikh Anazeh beckons you,\" he said.\n\nSo the two of us worked our way leisurely through the crowd toward the side-street down which Anazeh had led his party. We found them looking very spruce and savage, four abreast, drawn up in the throat of an alley, old Anazeh sitting his horse at their head like a symbol of the ancient order waiting to assault the new. My horse was close beside him, held by Ahmed, acting servitor on foot.\n\nThe old man let loose the vials of his wrath on me the minute I drew near, and Mahommed ben Hamza took delicious pleasure in translating word for word.\n\n\"Is that the way an effendi in my care should be seen at such a time--on foot? Am I a maskin that you do not ride? Is the horse not good enough?\"\n\nI made ben Hamza explain that I was to attend the mejlis as Sheikh Abdul Ali's guest. But that only increased his wrath.\n\n\"So said ben Nazir! Shall a lousy Damascene trick me out of keeping my oath? You are in my safekeeping until you tread on British soil again, and my honour is concerned in it! No doubt that effeminate schemer of schemes would like to display you at the mejlis as his booty, but you are mine! Did you think you are not under obligation to me?\"\n\nI answered pretty tactfully. I said that Allah had undoubtedly created him to be a protector of helpless wayfarers and the very guardian of honour. Mahommed ben Hamza added to the compliments while rendering mine into Arabic. But though Anazeh's wrath was somewhat mollified, he was not satisfied by any means.\n\n\"Am I a dog,\" he demanded, \"that I should be slighted for the sake of that Damascene?\"\n\nIt looked to me like the proper moment to try out Grim's magic formula.\n\n\"You are the father of lions. And a lion knows a lion in the dark!\" said I.\n\nThe effect was instantaneous. He puffed his cheeks out in astonishment, and sucked them in again. The overbearing anger vanished as he leaned forward in the saddle to scrutinize my face. It was clear that he thought my use of that phrase might just possibly have been an accident.\n\n\"Jimgrim says--\"\n\n\"Ah! What says Jimgrim? Who are you that know where he is?\"\n\n\"A lion knows a lion in the dark!\" I said again, that there might be no mistake about my having used the words deliberately.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Praised be Allah! Blessings upon His Prophet! What says Jimgrim?\"\n\n\"Jimgrim says I am to keep by Anazeh and watch him, lest he drink strong drink and lose his honour by becoming like a beast without decency or understanding!\"\n\n\"Mount your horse, effendi. Sit beside me.\"",
    "\"Money doesn't weigh much,\" Anazeh answered. \"Here my men come.\"\n\nSomebody was coming. There came a burst of shooting and yelling from somewhere between us and El-Kerak, and a moment later the thunder of horses galloping full-pelt. Anazeh got down to the road with the agility of a youngster, ordered Abdul Ali of Damascus, the shivering Ahmed and me under cover. He placed his remaining handful of men at points of vantage where they could cover the retreat of the fifteen. And it was well he did.\n\nThere were at least two score in hot pursuit, and though you could hardly tell which was which in that dim light, Anazeh's party opened fire on the pursuers and let the fifteen through. I did not get sight of Grim while that excitement lasted, but he had two automatics. He took from me the one that I had taken from Abdul Ali, and with that one and his own he made a din like a machine-gun. He told me afterward that he had fired in the air.\n\n\"Noise is as good as knock-outs in the dark,\" he explained, while Anazeh's men boasted to one another of the straight shooting that it may be they really believed they had done. An Arab can believe anything--afterward. I don't believe one man was killed, though several were hit.\n\nAt any rate, whether the noise accomplished it or not, the pursuers drew off, and we went forward, carrying a cashbox now, of which Abdul Ali was politely requested to produce the key. That was the first intimation he had that his house had been looted. He threw his bunch of keys away into the shadows, in the first exhibition of real weakness he had shown that night. It was a silly gesture. It only angered his captors. It saved him nothing.\n\nFour more of Anazeh's men had been wounded, all from behind, two of them rather badly, making six in all who were now unfit for further action. But we did not wait to bandage them. They affected to make light of their injuries, saying they would go over to the British and get attended to in hospital. Abdul Ali was put on Ahmed's miserable mount, with his legs lashed under the horse's belly. Ahmed, with Mahommed ben Hamza and his men were sent along ahead; being unarmed, unmounted, they were a liability now. But those Hebron thieves could talk like an army; they put up a prodigious bleat, all night long, about that cash-box. They maintained they had a clear right to share its contents, since unless they had first captured Abdul Ali, Anazeh's men could not have burned his house and seized his money. Anazeh's men, when they had time to be, were suitably amused.\n\nIt was not a peaceful retreat by any means. Time and again before morning we were fired on from the rear. Our party deployed to right and left to answer--always boasting afterward of having killed at least a dozen men. I added up their figures on the fly-leaf of the pocket Bible, and the total came to two hundred and eighteen of the enemy shot dead and forever damned! I believe Anazeh actually did kill one of our pursuers.\n\nBy the time the moon disappeared we had come too close to Anazeh's country to make pursuit particularly safe. Who they were who pursued us, hauled off. We reached the launch, secure in its cove between the rocks, a few minutes after dawn. Anazeh ordered his six wounded men into it, with perfect assurance that the British doctors would take care of them and let them go unquestioned.\n\nWhen Grim had finished talking with Anazeh I went up to thank the old fellow for my escort, and he acknowledged the courtesy with a bow that would have graced the court of Solomon.\n\n\"Give the old bird a present, if you've got one,\" Grim whispered.\n\nSo I gave him my watch and chain, and he accepted them with the same calm dignity.\n\n\"Now he's your friend for life!\" said Grim. \"Anazeh is a friend worth having. Let's go!\"\n\nThe watch and chain was a cheap enough price to pay for that two days' entertainment and the acquaintance of such a splendid old king of thieves. Anazeh watched us away until we were out of earshot, he and Grim exchanging the interminable Arab farewell formula of blessing and reply that have been in use unchanged for a thousand years.\n\nThen Abdul Ali produced his wallet again.\n\n\"Major Grim,\" he said, \"please take this money. Keep it for yourse\"",
    "We trudged together down the dusty Bethlehem Road, turned to the east just short of the Pool of the Sultan (where they now had a delousing station for British soldiers) and went nearly to the end of the colony of neat stone villas that the Germans built before the War, and called Rephaim. It was a prosperous colony until the Kaiser, putting two and two, made five of them and had to guess again.\n\nThe house we sought stood back from the narrow road, at a corner, surrounded by a low stone wall and a mass of rather dense shrubs that obscured the view from the windows. The front door was a thing of solid olive-wood. We had to hammer on it for several minutes. There was no bell.\n\nA woman opened it at last--an Arab in native costume, gazelle-eyed, as they all are, and quite good looking, although hardly in her first youth. Her face struck me as haunted. She was either ashamed when her eyes met Grim's or else afraid of him. But she smiled pleasantly enough and without asking our business led the way at once to a room at the other end of a long hall that was crowded with all sorts of curios. They were mostly stone bric-a-brac-fragments of Moabite pottery and that kind of thing, with a pretty liberal covering of ordinary house dust. In fact, the house had the depressing \"feel\" of a rarely visited museum.\n\nThe room she showed us into was the library--three walls lined with books, mostly with German titles--a big cupboard in one corner, reaching from floor to ceiling--a big desk by the window--three armchairs and a stool. There were no pictures, and the only thing that smacked of ornament was the Persian rug on the floor.\n\nWe waited five minutes before Scharnhoff came in, looking as if we had disturbed his nap. He was an untidy stout man with green goggles and a grayish beard, probably not yet sixty years of age, and well preserved. He kept his pants up with a belt, and his shirt bulged untidily over the top. When he sat down you could see the ends of thick combinations stuffed into his socks. He gave you the impression of not fitting into western clothes at all and of being out of sympathy with most of what they represent.\n\nHe was cordial enough--after one swift glance around the room.\n\n\"Brought a new acquaintance for you,\" said Grim, introducing me. \"I've told him how all the subalterns come to you for Palestinian lore--\"\n\n\"Ach! The young Lotharios! Each man a Don Juan! All they come to me for is tales of Turkish harems, of which I know no more than any one. They are not interested in subjects of real importance. 'How many wives had Djemal Pasha? How many of them were European?' That is what they ask me. When I discuss ancient history it is only about King Solomon's harem that they care to know; or possibly about the modern dancing girls of El-Kerak, who are all spies. But there is no need to inform you as to that. Eh? I haven't seen you for a long time, Major Grim. What have you been doing?\"\n\n\"Nothing much. I was at the Tomb of the Kings yesterday.\"\n\nScharnhoff smiled scornfully.\n\n\"Now you must have some whiskey to take the taste of that untruth out of your mouth! How can a man of your attainments call that obviously modern fraud by such a name? The place is not nearly two thousand years old! It is probably the tomb of a Syrian queen named Adiabene and her family. Josephus mentions it. This land is full--every square metre of it--of false antiquities with real names, and real antiquities that never have been discovered! But why should a man like you, Major Grim, lend yourself to perpetuating falsity?\"\n\nHe walked over to the cupboard to get whiskey, and from where we sat we could both of us see what he was doing. The cupboard was in two parts, top and bottom, without any intervening strip of wood between the doors, which fitted tightly. When he opened the top part the lower door opened with it. He kicked it shut again at once, but I had seen inside--not that it was interesting at the moment.\n\nHe set whiskey and tumblers on the desk, poured liberally, and went on talking.\n\n\"Tomb of the Kings? Hah! Tomb of the Kings of Judah? Hah! If any one can find that, he will have something more important than Ludendorff's memoirs! Something merkwurdig, believe me!\"\n\nHe stiffened suddenly, and looked at Grim through the green goggles as if he were judging an antiquity.\n\n\"Perhaps this is not the time to make you a little suggestion, eh?\"\n\nGrim's face wrinkled into smiles.\n\n\"This man knows enough to hang me anyhow! Fire away!\"\n\n\"Ah! But I would not like him to hang me!\"\n\n\"He's as close as a clam. What's your notion?\"\n\n\"Nothing serious, but--between us three, then--you and I are both foreigners in this place, Major Grim, although I have made it my home for fifteen years. You have no more interest in this government and its ridiculous rules than I have. What do you say--shall we find the Tomb of the Kings together?\"\n\nGrim wrinkled into smiles again and glanced down at his uniform.\n\n\"Yes, exactly!\" agreed Scharnhoff. \"That is the whole point. They call me an enemy alien. I am to all intents and purposes a prisoner. You are a British officer--can do what you like--go where you like. You wear red tabs; you are on the staff; nobody will dare to question you. These English have stopped all exploration until they get their mandate. After that they will take good care that only English societies have the exploration privilege. But what if we--you and I, that is to say--between us extract the best plum from the pudding before those miscalled statesmen sign the mandate--eh? It can be done! It can be done!\"\n\nGrim chuckled:\n\n\"I suppose you already see a picture of you and me with an ancient tomb in our trunks--say a few tons of the more artistic parts--beating it for the frontier and hawking the stuff afterward to second-hand furniture dealers? Pour me another whiskey, prof, and then we'll go steal the Mosque of Omar!\"\n\n\"Ach! You laugh at me--you jest--you mock--you sneer. But I know what I propose. Do you know what will be found in that Tomb of the Kings of Judah when we discover it?\"\n\n\"Bones. Dry bones. A few gold ornaments perhaps. A stale smell certainly.\"\n\n\"The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel! Think of it! A parchment roll--perhaps two or three rolls--not too big to go into a valise--worth more than all the other ancient manuscripts in the world all put together! Himmel! What a find that would be! What a record! What a refutation of all the historians and the fools who set themselves up for authorities nowadays! What a price it would bring! What would your Metropolitan Museum in New York not pay for it! What would the Jews not pay for it! They would raise millions among them and pay any price we cared to ask! The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel--only think!\"",
    "Djemal's coffee shop is run by a Turkish gentleman whose real name is Yussuf. One name, and the shorter the better, had been plenty in the days when Djemal Pasha ran Jerusalem with iron ruthlessness, and consequent success of a certain sort. When Djemal was the Turkish Governor, every proprietor of every kind of shop had to stand in the doorway at attention whenever Djemal passed, and woe betide the laggard!\n\nIt would not have paid any one, in those days, to name any sort of shop after Djemal Pasha. Even the provider of the rope that throttled the offender would have made no profit, because the rope would simply have been looted from the nearest store. The hangman would have been the nearest soldier, whose pay was already two years in arrears. So Yussuf's own name done in Turkish characters used to stand over the door before the British came.\n\nIt was Djemal Pasha's considered judgment that Yussuf cooked the best coffee in Jerusalem. So whenever the despot was in the city he conferred on Yussuf the inestimable privilege of supplying him with coffee at odd moments, under threat of the bastinado if the stuff were not suitably sweet and hot. The only money that ever changed hands in that connection was when the tax-gatherer came down on Yussuf for an extra levy, because of the added trade that conceivably might be expected to accrue through the advertisement obtained by serving such an exalted customer. The tax-gatherer also threatened the bastinado; and as the man who likes that punishment, or who could soften the heart of a Turkish tax assessor, has yet to be discovered, Yussuf invariably paid.\n\nBut when Allenby conquered Palestine between bouts of trying to tame his Australians, and Djemal Pasha scooted hot-foot into exile with a two-hundred-woman harem packed in lorries at his rear, Yussuf remembered that old adage about better late than never. He put Djemal's name on the stone arch of the narrow door near the foot of David Street. He did it partly out of the disrespect that a small dog feels for a big one that is now on chain; but he was not overlooking the business value of it.\n\nThe first result was that he did quite a lot of trade with British officers, who came primarily because they were sick of eating sand and bully-beef, and drinking sand and tepid water in the desert. Later they flocked there by way of paying indirect homage to a governor who, whatever his obvious demerits, had at any rate never been answered back or thwarted with impunity. (There was a time, after the capture of Jerusalem, when if the British army could have voted on it, Djemal Pasha would have been brought back and given a free hand.)\n\nBut the officers began to discover that Yussuf was charging them four or five times the proper price. The seniors objected promptly, and deserted, to the inexpressible delight of the subalterns; but even the under-paid extravagant youths grew tired of extortion after a month or two, and Yussuf had to look elsewhere for customers.\n\nYussuf did some thinking behind that genial Turkish mask of his. Competition was keen. There are more coffee shops in Jerusalem than hairs on a hog's back, and the situation, down near the bottom of that narrow thoroughfare in the shadow of an ancient arch, did not lend itself to drawing crowds.\n\nBut there were others in Jerusalem besides the British officers who yearned for Djemal's rule again; and, unlike the irreverent men in khaki, they did not dare to voice their feelings in public. All the old political grafters, and all the would-be new ones savagely resented a regime under which bribery was not permitted; and, as always happens sooner or later, they began to show a tendency to meet in certain places, where they might talk violence without risk of incurring it.\n\nSo Yussuf permitted a rumour to gain ground that he, too, was a malcontent and that the British had deserted his coffee shop for that reason. He gave out that Djemal Pasha's name over the door stood for reaction and political intrigue. So his place began to be frequented by effendis in tarboosh and semi-European clothes, who could chew the cud of bitterness aloud between walls that the crusaders had built four feet thick. The only entrance was through the narrow front door, where Yussuf inspected every visitor before admitting him.\n\nSo Yussuf's \"Cafe Djemal Pasha\" was the place to go to for politics, of the red-hot, death-and-dynamite order that would make Lenin and Trotsky sound like small-town sports. But first you had to get by Yussuf at the door.",
    "\"Any news about your oil concessions, Davey?\"\n\n\"No. Not a word. We've got every prospect in the country marked out. Nothing to do now but wait for the mandate, while the Zionists go behind our backs to the Foreign Office and scheme for the concessions. It's my belief the British mean to favor the Zionists and put us in the ditch. The fact that we were first on the ground, and lodged our applications with the Turks before the war seems to make no difference in their lives.\"\n\n\"Well, old man, I've arranged for you to change your policy,\" said Grim.\n\n\"What in thunder do you mean?\"\n\nMrs. Davey giggled with delight, but her husband frowned ominously.\n\n\"I'm supposed to be Staff-Captain Ali Mirza of the Shereefian army.\"\n\n\"I've heard of him. He's a bad one, Jim. He is one of those Syrian Arabs who will accept any one's money, but who never stays bought. Why masquerade as a scoundrel?\"\n\n\"I was in a place just now with a bunch of murderers, who'd have made short work of me if I couldn't give them a sound reason for being in Jerusalem just now.\"\n\n\"Why not have 'em all arrested?\"\n\n\"For the same reason, Davey, that your Oil Company isn't piping ten thousand barrels a day from Jericho. The time is not yet. Things haven't reached that stage. I told them your Oil Company gave up hope long ago of getting a concession from the British, and has decided to finance Mustapha Kemal.\"\n\nDavey flung his cigar out of the window, and laid both hands on his knees. His face was a picture of baffled indignation. But his wife laughed.\n\n\"They were tickled to death,\" Grim continued. \"I'm supposed to be going to Damascus tomorrow morning with a hundred thousand dollars in U.S. gold, obtained from you in ten small bags. We've got to find some bags and pack them full of something heavy.\"\n\n\"I'll have nothing to do with it!\" Davey exploded at last. \"It's a damned outrage! Why--this tale will be all over the place. The Jews will get hold of it, and make complaints in London. Next you know, the U.S. State Department will be raising blue hell. Questions asked in Congress. Headlines in all the papers! What do you suppose our people will think of me?\"\n\n\"Refer them to your wife, Davey. She's got you out of much worse messes.\"\n\n\"I'll drive the car straight up to OETA and lodge my protest against this in less than fifteen minutes!\"\n\n\"No need, Davey, old man. Goodenough will be in here presently. Kick to him.\"\n\nMrs. Davey went into the next room and returned with a roll of coarse cotton cloth.\n\n\"I've no bags, Jim, but if this stuff will do I can sew some right now.\"\n\n\"Good enough, Emily, go to it.\"\n\n\"D'you want to lose me my job?\" demanded Davey. But his wife took up the scissors and smiled back at him.\n\n\"You know better than that. We've trusted Jim before.\"\n\n\"Listen, Davey; this thing's serious,\" said Grim.\n\n\"I know it is! So'm I! Nothing doing!\"\n\n\"You're on the inside of an official secret.\"\n\n\"Curse all official secrets! My business is oil!\"\n\n\"There'll be no oil in this man's land for any one for fifty years if you won't play. There'll be a jihad instead. They're planning to blow up the Dome of the Rock.\"\n\n\"Jee-rusalem!\"\n\n\"Straight goods, Davey. Two tons of TNT stolen, and our friend Scharnhoff, the Austrian, hunting for the Tomb of the Kings--digging for it day and night--conspirators waiting to run in the explosive as soon as the tunnel is complete.\"\n\n\"Why not arrest 'em at once?\"\n\n\"We want to catch the principals red-handed, explosive and all. We don't know where the explosive is yet. Bag the lot, and kill the story. Otherwise, d'you see what it means, if the news leaks out? They'll blame the attempt on the Jews. And the minute the British protect the Jews there'll be all Moslem Asia on fire. Get me?\"\n\n\"Get you? Yes, I get you. I'll get hell from the home office, though, for meddling in politics.\"\n\nGoodenough came in then, rather a different man from the stern little martinet who had stood in the throat of the arcade. He was all smiles.\n\n\"Evening, Mrs. Davey,\" he said genially. \"That one man went away, Grim, and three took his place. They shan't be disturbed. Narayan Singh has gone off duty. Now, Mrs. Davey, I've been told that Americans all went dry, on account of a new religion called the Volstead Act. D'you mean to say you'd tempt a thirsty soldier with a dry martini?\"",
    "You must walk through Jerusalem by night, with the moon just rising, if you want really to get the glamour of eastern tales and understand how true to life those stories are of old Haroun-al-Raschid. It is almost the only city left with its ancient walls all standing, with its ancient streets intact. At that time, in 1920, there was nothing whatever new to mar the setting. No new buildings. The city was only cleaner than it was under the Turks.\n\nParts of the narrow thoroughfares are roofed over with vaulted arches. The domed roofs rise in unplanned, beautiful disorder against a sky luminous with jewels. To right and left you can look through key-hole arches down shadowy, narrow ways to carved doors through which Knights Templar used to swagger with gold spurs, and that Saladin's men appropriated after them.\n\nYellow lamplight, shining from small windows set deep in the massive walls, casts an occasional band of pure gold across the storied gloom. Now and then a man steps out from a doorway, his identity concealed by flowing eastern finery, pauses for a moment in the light to look about him, and disappears into silent mystery.\n\nHalf-open doors at intervals give glimpses of white interiors, and of men from a hundred deserts sitting on mats to smoke great water-pipes and talk intrigue. There are smells that are stagnant with the rot of time; other smells pungent with spice, and mystery, and the alluring scent of bales of merchandise that, like the mew of gulls, can set the mind traveling to lands unseen.\n\nThrough other arched doors, even at night, there is a glimpse of blindfold camels going round and round in ancient gloom at the oil-press. There are no sounds of revelry. The Arab takes his pleasures stately fashion, and the Jew has learned from history that the safest way to enjoy life is to keep quiet about it. Now and then you can hear an Arab singing a desert song, not very musical but utterly descriptive of the life he leads. We caught the sound of a flute played wistfully in an upper room by some Jew returned from the West to take up anew the thread of ancient history.\n\nGrim nudged me sharply in one shadowy place, where the street went down in twenty-foot-long steps between the high walls of windowless harems. Another narrow street crossed ours thirty feet ahead of us, and our two guides were hurrying, only glancing back at intervals to make sure we had not given them the slip. The cross-street was between us and them, and as Grim nudged me two men--a bulky, bearded big one and one of rather less than middle height, both in Arab dress--passed in front of us. There was no chance of being overheard, and Grim spoke in a low voice:\n\n\"Do you recognize them?\" \n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Scharnhoff and Noureddin Ali!\"\n\nI don't see now how he recognized them. But I suppose a man who works long enough at Grim's business acquires a sixth sense. They were walking swiftly, arguing in low tones, much too busy with their own affairs to pay attention to us. Our two guides glanced back a moment later, but they had vanished by then into the gloom of the cross-street.\n\nThere was a dim lamp at one corner of that crossing. As we passed through its pale circle of light I noticed a man who looked like an Arab lurking in the shadow just beyond it. I thought he made a sign to Grim, but I did not see Grim return it.\n\nGrim watched his chance, then spoke again:\n\n\"That man in the shadow is a Sikh--Narayan Singh's sidekick--keeping tabs on Scharnhoff. I'll bet old Scharnhoff has cold feet and went to find Noureddin Ali to try and talk him out of it. Might as well try to pretty-pussy a bob-cat away from a hen-yard! Poor old Scharnhoff's in the soup!\"\n\nQuite suddenly after that we reached a fairly wide street and the arched Byzantine gateway of the Haram-es-Sheriff, through which we could see tall cypress trees against the moonlit sky and the dome of the mosque beyond them. They do say the Taj Mahal at Agra is a lovelier sight, and more inspiring; but perhaps that is because the Taj is farther away from the folk who like to have opinions at second-hand. Age, history, situation, setting, sanctity--the Dome of the Rock has the advantage of all those, and the purple sky, crowded with coloured stars beyond it is more wonderful over Jerusalem, because of the clearness of the mountain air.\n\nIn that minute, and for the first time, I hated the men who could plot to blow up that place. Hitherto I had been merely interested.\n\nBecause it was long after the hour when non-Moslem visitors are allowed to go about the place with guides, we were submitted to rather careful scrutiny by men who came out of the shadows and said nothing, but peered into our faces. They did not speak to let us by, but signified admittance by turning uninterested backs and retiring to some dark corners to resume the vigil. I thought that the Sikh sentry, who stood with bayonet fixed outside the arch, looked at Grim with something more than curiosity, but no sign that I could detect passed between them.\n\nThe great white moonlit courtyard was empty. Not a soul stirred in it. Not a shadow moved. Because of the hour there were not even any guides lurking around the mosque. The only shape that came to life as we approached the main entrance of the mosque was the man who takes care of the slippers for a small fee.\n\nGrim, since he was in military dress, allowed the attendant to tie on over his shoes the great straw slippers they keep there for that purpose. Suliman had nothing on his feet. I kicked off the red Damascus slippers I was wearing, and we entered the octagonal building by passing under a curtain at the rear of the deep, vaulted entrance.",
    "The silence shut down again. Suliman went fast asleep, snoring with the even cadence of a clock's tick, using my knees for a pillow with a perfect sense of ownership. He was there to keep care of me, not I of him. The sleep suggestion very soon took hold of me, too, for there was nothing whatever to do but sit and watch the shadows move, trying to liken them to something real as they changed shape in answer to the flickering of the tiny, naked flame. Thereafter, the vigil resolved itself into a battle with sleep, and an effort to keep my wits sufficiently alert for sudden use.\n\nI had no watch. There was nothing to give the least notion of how much time had passed. I even counted the boy's snores for a while, and watched one lonely louse moving along the wall--so many snores to the minute--so many snores to an inch of crawling; but the louse changed what little mind he had and did not walk straight, and I gave up trying to calculate the distance he traveled in zigzags and curves, although it would have been an interesting problem for a navigator. Finally, Suliman's snoring grew so loud that that in itself kept me awake; it was like listening to a hair-trombone; each blast of it rasped your nerves.\n\nYou could not hear anything in the mosque above, although there were only eleven steps and the opening was close at hand; for the floor above was thickly carpeted, and if there were any sounds they were swallowed by that and the great, domed roof. When I guessed it might be midnight I listened for the voice of the muezzin; but if he did call the more-than-usually faithful to wake up and pray, he did it from a minaret outside, and no faint echo of his voice reached me. I was closed in a tomb in the womb of living rock, to all intents and purposes.\n\nBut it must have been somewhere about midnight when I heard a sound that set every vein in my body tingling. At first it was like the sort of sound that a rat makes gnawing; but there couldn't be rats eating their way through that solid stone. I thought I heard it a second time, but Suliman's snoring made it impossible to listen properly. I shook him violently, and he sat up.\n\n\"Keep still! Listen!\"\n\nBetween sleeping and waking the boy forgot all about the iron self-control he practised for Grim's exacting sake.\n\n\"What is it? I am afraid!\"\n\n\"Be still, confound you! Listen!\"\n\n\"How close beneath us are the souls of the dead? Oh, I am afraid!\"\n\n\"Silence! Breathe through your mouth. Make no noise at all!\"\n\nHe took my hand and tried to sit absolutely still; but the gnawing noise began again, more distinctly, followed by two or three dull thuds from somewhere beneath us.\n\n\"Oh, it is the souls of dead men! Oh--\"\n\n\"Shut up, you little idiot! All right, I'll tell Jimgrim!\"\n\nFear and that threat combined were altogether too much for him. One sprig of seedling manhood remained to him, and only one--the will to smother emotion that he could not control a second longer. He buried his head in my lap, stuffing his mouth with the end of the abiyi to choke the sobs back. I covered his head completely and, like the fabled ostrich, in that darkness he felt better.\n\nSuddenly, as clear as the ring of glass against thick glass in the distance, something gave way and fell beneath us. Then again. Then there were several thuds, followed by a rumble that was unmistakable--falling masonry; it was the noise that bricks make when they dump them from a tip-cart, only smothered by the thickness of the cavern floor. I shook Suliman again.\n\n\"Come on. We're going. Now, let me have a good account of you to give to Jimgrim. Shut your teeth tight, and remember the part you've got to play.\"\n\nHe scrambled up the steps ahead of me, and I had to keep hold of the skirts of his smock to prevent him from running. But he took my hand at the top, and we managed to get out through the north door without exciting comment, and without waking the spy, although I would just as soon have wakened him, for Grim seemed to think it important that his alibi and mine should be well established; however, there were two others watching by the hotel. Ten minutes later I was glad I had not disturbed him.",
    "The mechanism of the Administration's net was a thing to wonder at. As we emerged through the door the \"peasants\" who were loafing with their backs against the wall got up and formed a cordon across the street. Simultaneously, although I neither saw nor heard any signal, a dozen Sikhs under a British officer came down the street from the other direction at the double and formed up in line on our lefthand. A moment later, our men were battering the door down with their baulk of timber, working all together as if they had practised the stunt thoroughly.\n\nIt was a stout door, three inches thick, of ancient olivewood and reinforced with forged iron bands. The hinges, too, had been made by hand in the days when, if a man's house was not his fortress, he might just as well own nothing; they were cemented deep into the wall, and fastened to the door itself with half-inch iron rivets. The door had to be smashed to pieces, and the noise we made would have warned the devils in the middle of the world.\n\n\"We shouldn't have let them get in with any TNT at all,\" said Goodenough. \"They'll touch it off before we can prevent them.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh! They're not that kind,\" Grim answered. \"They'll fight for their skins. Have your gun ready, sir. They've laid their plans for a time-fuse and a quick getaway. They'll figure the going may be good still if they can once get past us. Look out for a rush!\"\n\nBut when the door went down at last in a mess of splinters there was no rush--nothing but silence--a dark, square, stone room containing two cots and a table, and fruit scattered all over the floor amid gray dust and fragments of cement. Grim laughed curtly.\n\n\"Look, sir!\"\n\nThe fruit-baskets were on the floor by one of the cots, and the TNT containers were still in them. They had tipped out the fruit, and then run at the sound of the battering ram.\n\nGoodenough stepped into the room, and we followed him. Beyond the table, half-hidden by a great stone slab, was a dark hole in the floor. Evidently the last man through had tried to cover up the hole, but had found the stone too heavy. The Sikhs dragged it clear and disclosed the mouth of a tunnel, rather less than a man's height, sloping sharply downward.\n\n\"What we need now is mustard gas. Smoke 'em out,\" said Goodenough.\n\n\"Might kill 'em,\" Grim objected.\n\n\"That'd be too bad, wouldn't it!\"\n\n\"We could starve 'em out, for that matter,\" said Grim. \"But they've probably got water down there, and perhaps food. Every hour of delay adds to the risk of rioting. We've got to get this hole sealed up permanently, and deny that it was ever opened.\"\n\n\"We could do that at once! But I won't be a party to sealing 'em up alive.\"\n\n\"Besides, sir, they've certainly got firearms, and they might just possible have one can of TNT down there.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Goodenough. \"I'll lead the way down.\"\n\n\"I've a plan,\" said Grim.\n\nHe took one of the fruit-baskets and began breaking it up.\n\n\"Who has a white shirt?\" he asked.\n\nI was the haberdasher. The others, Sikhs included, were all clothed in khaki from coat to skin. Grim's Bedouin array was dark-brown. I peeled the shirt off, and Grim rigged it on a frame of basket-work, with a clumsy pitch-forked arrangement of withes at the bottom. The idea was not obvious until he twisted the withes about his waist; then, when he bent down, the shirt stood up erect above him.\n\n\"If you don't mind, sir, we'll have two or three Sikhs go first. Have them take their boots off and crawl quietly as flat down as they can keep. I'll follow 'em with this contraption. They'll be able to see the white shirt dimly against the tunnel, and if they do any shooting they'll aim at that. Then if the rest of you keep low behind me we've a good chance to rush them before they can do any damage.\"\n\nI never met a commanding officer more free from personal conceit than Goodenough, and as I came to know more of him later on that characteristic stood out increasingly. He was not so much a man of ideas as one who could recognize them. That done, he made use of his authority to back up his subordinates, claiming no credit for himself but always seeing to it that they got theirs.\n\nThe result was that he was simultaneously despised and loved--despised by the self-advertising school, of which there are plenty in every army, and loved--with something like fanaticism by his junior officers and men.\n\n\"I agree to that,\" he said simply, screwing in his monocle. Then he turned and instructed the Sikhs in their own language. \"You follow last,\" he said to me. \"Now--all ready?\"\n\n\nHe had a pistol in one hand and a flashlight in the other, but had to stow them both away again in order to crawl in the tunnel. Grim had no weapon in sight. The two Sikhs who were to lead had stripped themselves of everything that might make a noise, but the others kept both boots and rifles, with bayonets fixed, for it did not much matter what racket they made. In fact, the more noise we, who followed, made, the better, since that would draw attention from the Sikhs in front. All we had to do was to keep our bodies below Grim's kite affair, out of the probable line of fire."

  "H. Rider Haggard -- Marie: An Episode in the Life of the Late Allan Quatermain": [
    "Although in my old age I, Allan Quatermain, have taken to writing\u2014after a fashion\u2014never yet have I set down a single word of the tale of my first love and of the adventures that are grouped around her beautiful and tragic history. I suppose this is because it has always seemed to me too holy and far-off a matter\u2014as holy and far-off as is that heaven which holds the splendid spirit of Marie Marais. But now, in my age, that which was far-off draws near again; and at night, in the depths between the stars, sometimes I seem to see the opening doors through which I must pass, and leaning earthwards across their threshold, with outstretched arms and dark and dewy eyes, a shadow long forgotten by all save me\u2014the shadow of Marie Marais.\n\nAn old man\u2019s dream, doubtless, no more. Still, I will try to set down that history which ended in so great a sacrifice, and one so worthy of record, though I hope that no human eye will read it until I also am forgotten, or, at any rate, have grown dim in the gathering mists of oblivion. And I am glad that I have waited to make this attempt, for it seems to me that only of late have I come to understand and appreciate at its true value the character of her of whom I tell, and the passionate affection which was her bounteous offering to one so utterly unworthy as myself. What have I done, I wonder, that to me should have been decreed the love of two such women as Marie and that of Stella, also now long dead, to whom alone in the world I told all her tale? I remember I feared lest she should take it ill, but this was not so. Indeed, during our brief married days, she thought and talked much of Marie, and some of her last words to me were that she was going to seek her, and that they would wait for me together in the land of love, pure and immortal.\n\nSo with Stella\u2019s death all that side of life came to an end for me, since during the long years which stretch between then and now I have never said another tender word to woman. I admit, however, that once, long afterwards, a certain little witch of a Zulu did say tender words to me, and for an hour or so almost turned my head, an art in which she had great skill. This I say because I wish to be quite honest, although it\u2014I mean my head, for there was no heart involved in the matter\u2014came straight again at once. Her name was Mameena, and I have set down her remarkable story elsewhere.\n\nTo return. As I have already written in another book, I passed my youth with my old father, a Church of England clergyman, in what is now the Cradock district of the Cape Colony.\n\nThen it was a wild place enough, with a very small white population. Among our few neighbours was a Boer farmer of the name of Henri Marais, who lived about fifteen miles from our station, on a fine farm called Maraisfontein. I say he was a Boer, but, as may be guessed from both his Christian and surname, his origin was Huguenot, his forefather, who was also named Henri Marais\u2014though I think the Marais was spelt rather differently then\u2014having been one of the first of that faith who emigrated to South Africa to escape the cruelties of Louis XIV. at the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\n\nUnlike most Boers of similar descent, these particular Marais\u2014for, of course, there are many other families so called\u2014never forgot their origin. Indeed, from father to son, they kept up some knowledge of the French tongue, and among themselves often spoke it after a fashion. At any rate, it was the habit of Henri Marais, who was excessively religious, to read his chapter of the Bible (which it is, or was, the custom of the Boers to spell out every morning, should their learning allow them to do so), not in the _taal_ or _patois_ Dutch, but in good old French. I have the very book from which he used to read now, for, curiously enough, in after years, when all these events had long been gathered to the past, I chanced to buy it among a parcel of other works at the weekly auction of odds and ends on the market square of Maritzburg. I remember that when I opened the great tome, bound over the original leather boards in buckskin, and discovered to whom it had belonged, I burst into tears. There was no doubt about it, for, as was customary in old days, this Bible had sundry fly-leaves sewn up with it for the purpose of the recording of events important to its owner.\n\nThe first entries were made by the original Henri Marais, and record how he and his compatriots were driven from France, his father having lost his life in the religious persecutions. After this comes a long list of births, marriages and deaths continued from generation to generation, and amongst them a few notes telling of such matters as the change of the dwelling-places of the family, always in French. Towards the end of the list appears the entry of the birth of the Henri Marais whom I knew, alas! too well, and of his only sister. Then is written his marriage to Marie Labuschagne, also, be it noted, of the Huguenot stock. In the next year follows the birth of Marie Marais, my Marie, and, after a long interval, for no other children were born, the death of her mother. Immediately below appears the following curious passage:\n\n\u201c_Le 3 Janvier, 1836. Je quitte ce pays voulant me sauver du maudit gouvernement Britannique comme mes anc\u00eatres se sont sauv\u00e9s de ce diable\u2014Louis XIV._\n\n_A bas les rois et les ministres tyrannique! Vive la libert\u00e9!_\u201d\n\nWhich indicates very clearly the character and the opinions of Henri Marais, and the feeling among the trek-Boers at that time.\n\nThus the record closes and the story of the Marais ends\u2014that is, so far as the writings in the Bible go, for that branch of the family is now extinct.\n\nTheir last chapter I will tell in due course.\n\nThere was nothing remarkable about my introduction to Marie Marais. I did not rescue her from any attack of a wild beast or pull her out of a raging river in a fashion suited to romance. Indeed, we interchanged our young ideas across a small and extremely massive table, which, in fact, had once done duty as a block for the chopping up of meat. To this hour I can see the hundreds of lines running criss-cross upon its surface, especially those opposite to where I used to sit.\n\n\nOne day, several years after my father had emigrated to the Cape, the Heer Marais arrived at our house in search, I think, of some lost oxen. He was a thin, bearded man with rather wild, dark eyes set close together, and a quick nervous manner, not in the least like that of a Dutch Boer\u2014or so I recall him. My father received him courteously and asked him to stop to dine, which he did.\n\n\nThey talked together in French, a tongue that my father knew well, although he had not used it for years; Dutch he could not, or, rather, would not, speak if he could help it, and Mr. Marais preferred not to talk English. To meet someone who could converse in French delighted him, and although his version of the language was that of two centuries before and my father\u2019s was largely derived from reading, they got on very well together, if not too fast.\n\n\nAt length, after a pause, Mr. Marais, pointing to myself, a small and stubbly-haired youth with a sharp nose, asked my father whether he would like me to be instructed in the French tongue. The answer was that nothing would please him better.\n\n\u201cAlthough,\u201d he added severely, \u201cto judge by my own experience where Latin and Greek are concerned, I doubt his capacity to learn anything.\u201d\n\nSo an arrangement was made that I should go over for two days in each week to Maraisfontein, sleeping there on the intervening night, and acquire a knowledge of the French tongue from a tutor whom Mr. Marais had hired to instruct his daughter in that language and other subjects. I remember that my father agreed to pay a certain proportion of this tutor\u2019s salary, a plan which suited the thrifty Boer very well indeed.",
    "Now the light was beginning to grow, flowing out of the pearly eastern sky; but no attack had yet been delivered, although that one was imminent that spear fixed in the plaster of the wall behind us showed clearly. Perhaps the Kaffirs had been frightened by the galloping of horses through their line in the dark, not knowing how many of them there might have been. Or perhaps they were waiting to see better where to deliver their onset. These were the ideas that occurred to me, but both were wrong.\n\nThey were staying their hands until the mist lifted a little from the hollow below the stead where the cattle kraals were situated, for while the fog remained they could not see to get the beasts out. These they wished to make sure of and drive away before the fight began, lest during its progress something should happen to rob them of their booty.\n\nPresently, from these kraals, where the Heer Marais\u2019s horned beasts and sheep were penned at night, about one hundred and fifty of the former and some two thousand of the latter, to say nothing of the horses, for he was a large and prosperous farmer, there arose a sound of bellowing, neighing, and baaing, and with it that of the shouting of men.\n\n\u201cThey are driving off the stock,\u201d said Marie. \u201cOh! my poor father, he is ruined; it will break his heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad enough,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut there are things that might be worse. Hark!\u201d\n\nAs I spoke there came a sound of stamping feet and of a wild war chant. Then in the edge of the mist that hung above the hollow where the cattle kraals were, figures appeared, moving swiftly to and fro, looking ghostly and unreal. The Kaffirs were marshalling their men for the attack. A minute more and it had begun. On up the slope they came in long, wavering lines, several hundreds of them, whistling and screaming, shaking their spears, their war-plumes and hair trappings blown back by the breeze, the lust of slaughter in their rolling eyes. Two or three of them had guns, which they fired as they ran, but where the bullets went I do not know, over the house probably.\n\nI called out to Leblanc and the Kaffirs not to shoot till I did, for I knew that they were poor marksmen and that much depended upon our first volley being effective. Then as the captain of this attack came within thirty yards of the stoep\u2014for now the light, growing swiftly, was strong enough to enable me to distinguish him by his apparel and the rifle which he held\u2014I loosed at him with the _roer_ and shot him dead. Indeed the heavy bullet passing through his body mortally wounded another of the Quabies behind. These were the first men that I ever killed in war.\n\nAs they fell, Leblanc and the rest of our people fired also, the slugs from their guns doing great execution at that range, which was just long enough to allow them to scatter. When the smoke cleared a little I saw that nearly a dozen men were down, and that the rest, dismayed by this reception, had halted. If they had come on then, while we were loading, doubtless they might have rushed the place; but, being unused to the terrible effects of firearms, they paused, amazed. A number of them, twenty or thirty perhaps, clustered about the bodies of the fallen Kaffirs, and, seizing my second gun, I fired both barrels at these with such fearful effect that the whole regiment took to their heels and fled, leaving their dead and wounded on the ground. As they ran our servants cheered, but I called to them to be silent and load swiftly, knowing well that the enemy would soon return.\n\nFor a time, however, nothing happened, although we could hear them talking somewhere near the cattle kraal, about a hundred and fifty yards away. Marie took advantage of this pause, I remember, to fetch food and distribute it among us. I, for one, was glad enough to get it.\n\nNow the sun was up, a sight for which I thanked Heaven, for, at any rate, we could no longer be surprised. Also, with the daylight, some of my fear passed away, since darkness always makes danger twice as terrible to man and beast. Whilst we were still eating and fortifying the window-places as best we could, so as to make them difficult to enter, a single Kaffir appeared, waving above his head a stick to which was tied a white ox-tail as a sign of truce. I ordered that no one should fire, and when the man, who was a bold fellow, had reached the spot where the dead captain lay, called to him, asking his business, for I could speak his language well.\n\nHe answered that he had come with a message from Quabie. This was the message: that Quabie\u2019s eldest son had been cruelly murdered by the fat white man called \u201cVulture\u201d who lived with the Heer Marais, and that he, Quabie, would have blood for blood. Still, he did not wish to kill the young white chieftainess (that was Marie) or the others in the house, with whom he had no quarrel. Therefore if we would give up the fat white man that he might make him \u201cdie slowly,\u201d Quabie would be content with his life and with the cattle that he had already taken by way of a fine, and leave us and the house unmolested.\n\nNow, when Leblanc understood the nature of this offer he went perfectly mad with mingled fear and rage, and began to shout and swear in French.\n\n\u201cBe silent,\u201d I said; \u201cwe do not mean to surrender you, although you have brought all this trouble on us. Your chance of life is as good as ours. Are you not ashamed to act so before these black people?\u201d\n\nWhen at last he grew more or less quiet I called to the messenger that we white folk were not in the habit of abandoning each other, and that we would live or die together. Still, I bade him tell Quabie that if we did die, the vengeance taken on him and all his people would be to wipe them out till not one of them was left, and therefore that he would do well not to cause any of our blood to flow. Also, I added, that we had thirty men in the house (which, of course, was a lie) and plenty of ammunition and food, so that if he chose to continue the attack it would be the worse for him and his tribe.\n\nOn hearing this the herald shouted back that we should every one of us be dead before noon if he had his way. Still, he would report my words faithfully to Quabie and bring his answer.\n\nThen he turned and began to walk off. Just as he did so a shot was fired from the house, and the man pitched forward to the ground, then rose again and staggered back towards his people, with his right shoulder shattered and his arm swinging.\n\n\u201cWho did that?\u201d I asked through the smoke, which prevented me from seeing.\n\n\u201cI, _parbleu!_\u201d shouted Leblanc. \u201c_Sapristi!_ that black devil wanted to torture me, Leblanc, the friend of the great Napoleon. Well, at least I have tortured him whom I meant to kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you fool,\u201d I answered; \u201cand we, too, shall be tortured because of your wickedness. You have shot a messenger carrying a flag of truce, and that the Quabies will never forgive. Oh! I tell you that you have hit us as well as him, who had it not been for you might have been spared.\u201d\n\nThese words I said quite quietly and in Dutch, so that our Kaffirs might understand them, though really I was boiling with wrath.\n\nBut Leblanc did not answer quietly.\n\n\u201cWho are you,\u201d he shouted, \u201cyou wretched little Englishman, who dare to lecture me, Leblanc, the friend of the great Napoleon?\u201d\n\nNow I drew my pistol and walked up to the man.\n\n\u201cBe quiet, you drunken sot,\u201d I said, for I guessed that he had drunk more of the brandy in the darkness. \u201cIf you are not quiet and do not obey me, who am in command here, either I will blow your brains out, or I will give you to these men,\u201d and I pointed to Hans and the Kaffirs, who had gathered round him, muttering ominously. \u201cDo you know what they will do with you? They will throw you out of the house, and leave you to settle your quarrel with Quabie alone.\u201d\n\nLeblanc looked first at the pistol, and next at the faces of the natives, and saw something in one or other of them, or in both, that caused him to change his note.\n\n\u201cPardon, monsieur,\u201d he said; \u201cI was excited. I knew not what I said. If you are young you are brave and clever, and I will obey you,\u201d and he went to his station and began to re-load his gun. As he did so a great shout of fury rose from the cattle kraal. The wounded herald had reached the Quabies and was telling them of the treachery of the white people.",
    "My journey back to the Mission Station was a strange contrast to that which I had made thence a few days before. Then, the darkness, the swift mare beneath me rushing through it like a bird, the awful terror in my heart lest I should be too late, as with wild eyes I watched the paling stars and the first gathering grey of dawn. Now, the creaking of the ox-cart, the familiar veld, the bright glow of the peaceful sunlight, and in my heart a great thankfulness, and yet a new terror lest the pure and holy love which I had won should be stolen away from me by force or fraud.\n\nWell, as the one matter had been in the hand of God, so was the other, and with that knowledge I must be content. The first trial had ended in death and victory. How would the second end? I wondered, and those words seemed to jumble themselves up in my mind and shape a sentence that it did not conceive. It was: \u201cIn the victory that is death,\u201d which, when I came to think of it, of course, meant nothing. How victory could be death I did not understand\u2014at any rate, at that time, I who was but a lad of small experience.\n\nAs we trekked along comfortably enough, for the road was good and the cart, being on springs, gave my leg no pain, I asked my father what he thought that the Heer Marais had meant when he told us that the Boers had business at Maraisfontein, during which our presence as Englishmen would not be agreeable to them.\n\n\u201cMeant, Allan? He meant that these traitorous Dutchmen are plotting against their sovereign, and are afraid lest we should report their treason. Either they intend to rebel because of that most righteous act, the freeing of the slaves, and because we will not kill out all the Kaffirs with whom they chance to quarrel, or to trek from the Colony. For my part I think it will be the latter, for, as you have heard, some parties have already gone; and, unless I am mistaken, many more mean to follow, Marais and Retief and that plotter, Pereira, among them. Let them go; I say, the sooner the better, for I have no doubt that the English flag will follow them in due course.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that they won\u2019t,\u201d I answered with a nervous laugh; \u201cat any rate, until I have won back my mare.\u201d (I had left her in Retief\u2019s care as stakeholder, until the match should be shot off.)\n\nFor the rest of that two and a half hours\u2019 trek my father, looking very dignified and patriotic, declaimed to me loudly about the bad behaviour of the Boers, who hated and traduced missionaries, loathed and abominated British rule and permanent officials, loved slavery and killed Kaffirs whenever they got the chance. I listened to him politely, for it was not wise to cross my parent when he was in that humour. Also, having mixed a great deal with the Dutch, I knew that there was another side to the question, namely, that the missionaries sometimes traduced them (as, in fact, they did), and that British rule, or rather, party government, played strange tricks with the interests of distant dependencies. That permanent officials and im-permanent ones too\u2014such as governors full of a little brief authority\u2014often misrepresented and oppressed them. That Kaffirs, encouraged by the variegated policy of these party governments and their servants, frequently stole their stock; and if they found a chance, murdered them with their women and children, as they had tried to do at Maraisfontein; though there, it is true, they had some provocation. That British virtue had liberated the slaves without paying their owners a fair price for them, and so forth.\n\nBut, to tell the truth, it was not of these matters of high policy, which were far enough away from a humble youth like myself, that I was thinking. What appealed to me and made my heart sick was the reflection that if Henri Marais and his friends trekked, Marie Marais must perforce trek with them; and that whereas I, an Englishman, could not be of that adventurous company, Hernando Pereira both could and would.\n\nOn the day following our arrival home, what between the fresh air, plenty of good food, for which I found I had an appetite, and liberal doses of Pontac\u2014a generous Cape wine that is a kind of cross between port and Burgundy\u2014I found myself so much better that I was able to hop about the place upon a pair of crutches which Hans improvised for me out of Kaffir sticks. Next morning, my improvement continuing at a rapid rate, I turned my attention seriously to the shooting match, for which I had but five days to prepare.\n\nNow it chanced that some months before a young Englishman of good family\u2014he was named the Honourable Vavasseur Smyth\u2014who had accompanied an official relative to the Cape Colony, came our way in search of sport, of which I was able to show him a good deal of a humble kind. He had brought with him, amongst other weapons, what in those days was considered a very beautiful hair-triggered small-bore rifle fitted with a nipple for percussion caps, then quite a new invention. It was by a maker of the name of J. Purdey, of London, and had cost quite a large sum because of the perfection of its workmanship. When the Honourable V. Smyth\u2014of whom I have never heard since\u2014took his leave of us on his departure for England, being a generous-hearted young fellow, as a souvenir of himself, he kindly presented me with this rifle,[1] which I still have.  That was about six months earlier than the time of which I write, and during those months I had often used this rifle for the shooting of game, such as blesbuck and also of bustards. I found it to be a weapon of the most extraordinary accuracy up to a range of about two hundred yards, though when I rode off in that desperate hurry for Maraisfontein I did not take it with me because it was a single barrel and too small in the bore to load with loopers at a pinch. Still, in challenging Pereira, it was this gun and no other that I determined to use; indeed, had I not owned it I do not think that I should have ventured on the match.\n\nAs it happened, Mr. Smyth had left me with the rifle a large supply of specially cast bullets and of the new percussion caps, to say nothing of some very fine imported powder. Therefore, having ammunition in plenty, I set to work to practise. Seating myself upon a chair in a deep kloof near the station, across which rock pigeons and turtle doves were wont to fly in numbers at a considerable height, I began to fire at them as they flashed over me.\n\nNow, in my age, I may say without fear of being set down a boaster, that I have one gift, that of marksmanship, which, I suppose, I owe to some curious combination of judgment, quickness of eye, and steadiness of hand. I can declare honestly that in my best days I never knew a man who could beat me in shooting at a living object; I say nothing of target work, of which I have little experience. Oddly enough, also, I believe that at this art, although then I lacked the practice which since has come to me in such plenty, I was as good as a youth as I have ever been in later days, and, of course, far better than I am now. This I soon proved upon the present occasion, for seated there in that kloof, after a few trials, I found that I could bring down quite a number of even the swift, straight-flying rock pigeons as they sped over me, and this, be it remembered, not with shot, but with a single bullet, a feat that many would hold to be incredible.\n\nSo the days passed, and I practised, every evening finding me a little better at this terribly difficult sport. For always I learned more as to the exact capacities of my rifle and the allowance that must be made according to the speed of the bird, its distance, and the complications of the wind and of the light. During those days, also, I recovered so rapidly that at the end of them I was almost in my normal condition, and could walk well with the aid of a single stick.\n\nAt length the eventful Thursday came, and about midday\u2014for I lay in bed late that morning and did not shoot\u2014I drove, or, rather, was driven, in a Cape cart with two horses to the place known as Groote Kloof or Great Gully. Over this gorge the wild geese flighted from their _pans_ or feeding grounds on the high lands above, to other _pans_ that lay some miles below, and thence, I suppose, straight out to the sea coast, whence they returned at dawn.",
    "\u201cYes, Allan,\u201d replied Marie in her quiet fashion, \u201cI have affianced myself\u2014to you and no other man.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear, mynheer,\u201d I said to Marais.\n\nThen he broke out in his usual excitable manner. He stormed, he argued, he rated us both. He said that he would never allow it; that first he would see his daughter in her grave. That I had abused his confidence and violated his hospitality; that he would shoot me if I came near his girl. That she was a minor, and according to the law he could dispose of her in marriage. That she must accompany him whither he was going; that certainly I should not do so, and much more of the same sort.\n\nWhen at last he had tired himself out and smashed his favourite pipe upon the table, Marie spoke, saying:\n\n\u201cMy father, you know that I love you dearly, for since my mother\u2019s death we have been everything to each other, have we not?\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely, Marie, you are my life, and more than my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, my father. That being so, I acknowledge your authority over me, whatever the law may say. I acknowledge that you have the right to forbid me to marry Allan, and if you do forbid me\u2014while I am under age, at any rate\u2014I shall not marry him because of my duty to you. But\u201d\u2014here she rose and looked him full in the eyes, and oh! how stately she seemed at that moment in her simple strength and youthful grace!\u2014\u201cthere is one thing, my father, that I do not acknowledge\u2014your right to force me to marry any other man. As a woman with power over herself, I deny that right; and much as it pains me, my father, to refuse you anything, I say that first I will die. To Allan here I have given myself for good or for evil, and if I may not marry Allan, I will go to the grave unwed. If my words hurt you, I pray you to pardon me, but at the same time to remember that they are my words, which cannot be altered.\u201d\n\nMarais looked at his daughter, and his daughter looked at Marais. At first I thought that he was about to curse her; but if this were so, something in her eyes seemed to change his mind, for all he said was:\n\n\u201cIntractable, like the rest of your race! Well, Fate may lead those who cannot be driven, and this matter I leave in the hands of Fate. While you are under age\u2014that is, for two years or more\u2014you may not marry without my consent, and have just promised not to do so. Presently we trek from this country into far-off lands. Who knows what may happen there?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said my father in a solemn voice, speaking for the first time, \u201cwho knows except God, Who governs all things, and will settle these matters according to His will, Henri Marais? Listen,\u201d he went on after a pause, for Marais made no answer, but sat himself down and stared gloomily at the table. \u201cYou do not wish my son to marry your daughter for various reasons, of which one is that you think him poor and a richer suitor has offered himself after a reverse of fortune has made _you_ poor. Another and a greater, the true reason, is his English blood, which you hate so much that, although by God\u2019s mercy he saved her life, you do not desire that he should share her life. Is it not true?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is true, Mynheer Quatermain. You English are bullies and cheats,\u201d he answered excitedly.\n\n\u201cAnd so you would give your daughter to one who has shown himself humble and upright, to that good hater of the English and plotter against his King, Hernando Pereira, whom you love because he alone is left of your ancient race.\u201d\n\nRemembering the incident of the afternoon, this sarcasm reduced Marais to silence.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d went on my father, \u201calthough I am fond of Marie, and know her to be a sweet and noble-hearted girl, neither do I wish that she should marry my son. I would see him wed to some English woman, and not dragged into the net of the Boers and their plottings. Still, it is plain that these two love each other with heart and soul, as doubtless it has been decreed that they should love. This being so, I tell you that to separate them and force another marriage upon one of them is a crime before God, of which, I am sure, He will take note and pay it back to you. Strange things may happen in those lands whither you go, Henri Marais. Will you not, then, be content to leave your child in safe keeping?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever!\u201d shouted Marais. \u201cShe shall accompany me to a new home, which is not under the shadow of your accursed British flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I have no more to say. On your head be it here and hereafter,\u201d replied my father solemnly.\n\nNow unable to control myself any longer I broke in:\n\n\u201cBut I have, mynheer. To separate Marie and myself is a sin, and one that will break her heart. As for my poverty, I have something, more perhaps than you think, and in this rich country wealth can be earned by those who work, as I would do for her sake. The man to whom you would give her showed his true nature this day, for he who can play so low a trick to win a wager, will play worse tricks to win greater things. Moreover, the scheme must fail since Marie will not marry him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say she shall,\u201d replied Marais; \u201cand that whether she does or not, she shall accompany me and not stay here to be the wife of an English boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccompany you I will, father, and share your fortunes to the last. But marry Hernando Pereira I will not,\u201d said Marie quietly.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, mynheer,\u201d I added, \u201cdays may come when once again you will be glad of the help of an \u2018English boy.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe words were spoken at random, a kind of ejaculation from the heart, caused by the sting of Marais\u2019s cruelty and insults, like the cry of a beast beneath a blow. Little did I know how true they would prove, but at times it is thus that truth is mysteriously drawn from some well of secret knowledge hidden in our souls.\n\n\u201cWhen I want your help I will ask for it,\u201d raved Marais, who, knowing himself to be in the wrong, strove to cover up that wrong with violence.\n\n\u201cAsked or unasked, if I live it shall be given in the future as in the past, Mynheer Marais. God pardon you for the woe you are bringing on Marie and on me.\u201d\n\nNow Marie began to weep a little, and, unable to bear that sight, I covered my eyes with my hand. Marais, who, when he was not under the influence of his prejudices or passion, had a kind heart, was moved also, but tried to hide his feelings in roughness. He swore at Marie, and told her to go to bed, and she obeyed, still weeping. Then my father rose and said:\n\n\u201cHenri Marais, we cannot leave here to-night because the horses are kraaled, and it would be difficult to find them in this darkness, so we must ask your hospitality till dawn.\u201d\n\n\u201c_I_ do not ask it,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cI go to sleep in the cart,\u201d and I limped from the room and the house, leaving the two men together.",
    "Nine days of fearful struggle had gone by. We had camped one night below the crest of a long slope strewn with great rocks, many of which we were obliged to roll out of the path by main force in order to make a way for the wagons. The oxen had to lie in their yokes all night, since we dared not let them loose fearing lest they should stray; also lions were roaring in the distance, although, game being plentiful, these did not come near to us. As soon as there was any light we let out the teams to fill themselves on the tussocky grass that grew about, and meanwhile cooked and ate some food.\n\nPresently the sun rose, and I saw that beneath us was a great stretch of plain covered with mist, and to the north, on our right, several denser billows of mist that marked the course of the Crocodile River.\n\nBy degrees this mist lifted, tall tops of trees appearing above it, till at length it thinned into vapour that vanished away as the sun rose. As I watched it idly, the woman, Jeel, crept up to me in her furtive fashion, touched me on the shoulder and pointed to a distant group of trees.\n\nLooking closely at these trees, I saw between them what at first I took for some white rocks. Further examination, as the mist cleared, suggested to my mind, however, that they might be wagon tilts. Just then the Zulu who understood Jeel\u2019s talk came up. I asked him as well as I could, for at that time my knowledge of his tongue was very imperfect, what she wished to say. He questioned her, and answered that she desired to tell me that those were the moving houses of the Amaboona (the Boer people), just where she had seen them nearly two moons ago.\n\nAt this tidings my heart seemed to stand still, so that for more than a minute I could not speak. There were the wagons at last, but\u2014oh! who and what should I find in them? I called Hans and bade him inspan as quickly as possible, explaining to him that yonder was Marais\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cWhy not let the oxen fill themselves first, baas?\u201d he answered. \u201cThere is no hurry, for though the wagons are there, no doubt all the people are dead long ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what I bid you, you ill-omened beast,\u201d I said, \u201cinstead of croaking of death like a crow. And listen: I am going to walk forward to that camp; you must follow with the wagons as fast as they can travel.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, baas, it is not safe that you should go alone. Kaffirs or wild beasts might take you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafe or not, I am going; but if you think it wise, tell two of those Zulus to come with me.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later I was on the road, followed by the two Kaffirs armed with spears. In my youth I was a good runner, being strong of leg and light in body, but I do not think that I ever covered seven miles, for that was about the distance to the camp, in quicker time than I did that morning. Indeed, I left those active Kaffirs so far behind that when I approached the trees they were not in sight. Here I dropped to a walk, as I said to myself\u2014to get my breath. Really it was because I felt so terrified at what I might find that I delayed the discovery just for one minute more. While I approached, hope, however faint, still remained; when I arrived, hope might be replaced by everlasting despair.\n\nNow I could see that there were some shanties built behind the wagons, doubtless those \u201crude houses\u201d of which Marie had written. But I could not see anyone moving about them, or any cattle or any smoke, or other sign of life. Nor could I hear a single sound.\n\nDoubtless, thought I to myself, Hans is right. They are all long dead.\n\nMy agony of suspense was replaced by an icy calm. At length I knew the worst. It was finished\u2014I had striven in vain. I walked through the outlying trees and between two of the wagons. One of these I noticed, as we do notice things at such times, was the same in which Marais had trekked with his daughter, his favourite wagon that once I had helped to fit with a new dissel-boom.\n\nBefore me were the rough houses built of the branches of trees, daubed over with mud, or rather the backs of them, for they faced west. I stood still for a moment, and as I stood thought that I heard a faint sound as of someone reciting slowly. I crept along the end of the outermost house and, rubbing the cold sweat from my eyes, peeped round the corner, for it occurred to me that savages might be in possession.\n\nThen I saw what caused the sound. A tattered, blackened, bearded man stood at the head of a long and shallow hole saying a prayer.\n\nIt was Henri Marais, although at the time I did not recognise him, so changed was he. A number of little mounds to the right and left of him told me, however, that the hole was a grave. As I watched two more men appeared, dragging between them the body of a woman, which evidently they had not strength to carry, as its legs trailed upon the ground.\n\nFrom the shape of the corpse it seemed to be that of a tall young woman, but the features I could not see, because it was being dragged face downwards. Also the long hair hanging from the head hid them. It was dark hair, like Marie\u2019s. They reached the grave, and tumbled their sad burden into it; but I\u2014I could not stir!\n\nAt length my limbs obeyed my will. I went forward to the men and said in a hollow voice in Dutch:\n\n\u201cWhom do you bury?\u201d\n\n\u201cJohanna Meyer,\u201d answered someone mechanically, for they did not seem to have taken the trouble to look at me. As I listened to those words my heart, which had stood still waiting for the answer, beat again with a sudden bound that I could hear in the silence.\n\nI looked up. There, advancing from the doorway of one of the houses, very slowly, as though overpowered by weakness, and leading by the hand a mere skeleton of a child, who was chewing some leaves, I saw\u2014I saw _Marie Marais!_ She was wasted to nothing, but I could not mistake her eyes, those great soft eyes that had grown so unnaturally large in the white, thin face.\n\nShe too saw me and stared for one moment. Then, loosing the child, she cast up her hands, through which the sunlight shone as through parchment, and slowly sank to the ground.\n\n\u201cShe has gone, too,\u201d said one of the men in an indifferent voice. \u201cI thought she would not last another day.\u201d\n\nNow for the first time the man at the head of the grave turned. Lifting his hand, he pointed to me, whereon the other two men turned also.\n\n\u201cGod above us!\u201d he said in a choked voice, \u201cat last I am quite mad. Look! there stands the _spook_ of young Allan, the son of the English pr\u00e9dicant who lived near Cradock.\u201d\n\nAs soon as I heard the voice I knew the speaker.\n\n\u201cOh, Mynheer Marais!\u201d I cried, \u201cI am no ghost, I am Allan himself come to save you.\u201d\n\nMarais made no answer; he seemed bewildered. But one of the men cried out crazily:\n\n\u201cHow can you save us, youngster, unless you are ready to be eaten? Don\u2019t you see, we starve, we starve!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have wagons and food,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cAllemachte! Henri,\u201d exclaimed the man, with a wild laugh, \u201cdo you hear what your English _spook_ says? He says that he has wagons and _food, food, food!_\u201d\n\nThen Marais burst into tears and flung himself upon my breast, nearly knocking me down. I wrenched myself free of him and ran to Marie, who was lying face upwards on the ground. She seemed to hear my step, for her eyes opened and she struggled to a sitting posture.\n\n\u201cIs it really you, Allan, or do I dream?\u201d she murmured.\n\n\u201cIt is I, it is I,\u201d I answered, lifting her to her feet, for she seemed to weigh no more than a child. Her head fell upon my shoulder, and she too began to weep.",
    "The last mile of that trek was through a narrow gorge cut out by water in the native rock. Here trees grew sparsely, also great ferns, but the bottom of the gorge, along which game were accustomed to travel, was smooth enough for wagons, save for a few fallen boulders, which it was necessary to avoid.\n\nWhen at length we reached the outspan I asked the Hottentot, Klaus, who was assisting me to drive the team, where his master was, for I could not see him anywhere. He answered that he had gone back down the kloof to look for something that had fallen from the wagon, a bolt I think he said.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d I replied. \u201cThen tell him, if we do not meet, that I have returned to the camp.\u201d\n\nAs I set out the sun was sinking below the horizon, but this did not trouble me overmuch, as I had a rifle with me, that same light rifle with which I had shot the geese in the great match. Also I knew that the moon, being full, would be up presently.\n\nThe sun sank, and the kloof was plunged in gloom. The place seemed eerie and lonesome, and suddenly I grew afraid. I began to wonder where Pereira was, and what he might be doing. I even thought of turning back and finding some way round, only having explored all this district pretty thoroughly in my various shooting expeditions from the camp, I knew there was no practicable path across those hills. So I went on with my rifle at full cock, whistling to keep up my courage, which, of course, in the circumstances was a foolish thing to do. It occurred to me at the time that it was foolish, but, in truth, I would not give way to the dark suspicions which crossed my mind. Doubtless by now Pereira had passed me and reached the outspan.\n\nThe moon began to shine\u2014that wonderful African moon, which turns night to day\u2014throwing a network of long, black shadows of trees and rocks across the game track I was following. Right ahead of me was a particularly dark patch of this shadow, caused by a projecting wall of cliff, and beyond it an equally bright patch of moonlight. Somehow I misdoubted me of that stretch of gloom, for although, of course, I could see nothing there, my quick ear caught the sound of movements.\n\nI halted for a moment. Then, reflecting that these were doubtless caused by some night-walking creature, which, even should it chance to be dangerous, would flee at the approach of man, I plunged into it boldly. As I emerged at the other end\u2014the shadow was eighteen or twenty paces long\u2014it occurred to me that if any enemy were lurking there, I should be an easy target as I entered the line of clear light. So, almost instinctively, for I do not remember that I reasoned the thing out, after my first two steps forward in the light I gave a little spring to the left, where there was still shadow, although it was not deep. Well was it for me that I did so, for at that moment I felt something touch my cheek and heard the loud report of a gun immediately behind me.\n\nNow, the wisest course would have been for me to run before whoever had fired found time to reload. But a kind of fury seized me, and run I would not. On the contrary, I turned with a shout, and charged back into the shadow. Something heard me coming, something fled in front of me. In a few seconds we were out into the moonlight beyond, and, as I expected, I saw that this something was a man\u2014Pereira!\n\nHe halted and wheeled round, lifting the stock of his gun, club fashion.\n\n\u201cThank God! it is you, Heer Allan,\u201d he said; \u201cI thought you were a tiger.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it is your last thought, murderer,\u201d I answered, raising my rifle.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you have my blood upon you? Why do you want to kill me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you try to kill me?\u201d I answered, covering him.\n\n\u201cI try to kill you! Are you mad? Listen, for your own sake. I sat down on the bank yonder waiting for the moon, and, being tired, fell asleep. Then I woke up with a start, and, thinking from the sounds that a tiger was after me, fired to scare it. Allemachte! man, if I had aimed at you, could I have missed at that distance?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not quite miss, and had I not stepped to the left, you would have blown my head off. Say your prayers, you dog!\u201d\n\n\u201cAllan Quatermain,\u201d he exclaimed with desperate energy, \u201cyou think I lie, who speak the truth. Kill me if you will, only then remember that you will hang for it. We court one woman, that is known, and who will believe this story of yours that I tried to shoot you? Soon the Kaffirs will come to look for me, probably they are starting already, and will find my body with your bullet in my heart. Then they will take it back to Marais\u2019s camp, and I say\u2014who will believe your story?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome, I think, murderer,\u201d but as I spoke the words a chill of fear struck me. It was true, I could prove nothing, having no witnesses, and henceforward I should be a Cain among the Boers, one who had slain a man for jealousy. His gun was empty; yes, but it might be said that I had fired it after his death. And as for the graze upon my cheek\u2014why, a twig might have caused it. What should I do, then? Drive him before me to the camp, and tell this tale? Even then it would be but my word against his. No, he had me in a forked stick. I must let him go, and trust that Heaven would avenge his crime, since I could not. Moreover, by now my first rage was cooling, and to execute a man thus\u2014\n\n\u201cHernan Pereira,\u201d I said, \u201cyou are a liar and a coward. You tried to butcher me because Marie loves me and hates you, and you want to force her to marry you. Yet I cannot shoot you down in cold blood as you deserve. I leave it to God to punish you, as, soon or late, He will, here or hereafter; you who thought to slaughter me and trust to the hyenas to hide your crime, as they would have done before morning. Get you gone before I change my mind, and be swift.\u201d\n\nWithout another word he turned and ran swiftly as a buck, leaping from side to side as he ran, to disturb my aim in case I should shoot.",
    "On the farther side of this space, where, before long, I was fated to witness a very tragic scene, I entered a kind of labyrinth. This was called _siklohlo_, and had high fences with numerous turns, so that it was impossible to see where one was going or to find the way in or out. Ultimately, however, I reached a great hut named _intunkulu_, a word that means the \u201chouse of houses,\u201d or the abode of the king, in front of which I saw a fat man seated on a stool, naked except for the _moocha_ about his middle and necklaces and armlets of blue beads. Two warriors held their broad shields over his head to protect him from the sun. Otherwise he was alone, although I felt sure that the numerous passages around him were filled with guards, for I could hear them moving.\n\nOn entering this place Kambula and his companions flung themselves upon their faces and began to sing praises of which the king took no notice. Presently he looked up, and appearing to observe me for the first time asked:\n\n\u201cWho is that white boy?\u201d\n\nThen Kambula rose and said:\n\n\u201cO king, this is the Son of George, whom you commanded me to capture. I have taken him and the _Amaboona_\u201d (that is, the Boers), \u201chis companions, and brought them all to you, O king.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember,\u201d said Dingaan. \u201cThe big Boer who was here, and whom Tambusa\u201d\u2014he was one of Dingaan\u2019s captains\u2014\u201clet go against my will, said that he was a terrible man who should be killed before he worked great harm to my people. Why did you not kill him, Kambula, although it is true he does not look very terrible?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the king\u2019s word was that I should bring him to the king living,\u201d answered Kambula. Then he added cheerfully: \u201cStill, if the king wishes it, I can kill him at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dingaan doubtfully; \u201cperhaps he can mend guns.\u201d Next, after reflecting a while, he bade a shield-holder to fetch someone, I could not hear whom.\n\n\u201cDoubtless,\u201d thought I to myself, \u201cit is the executioner,\u201d and at that thought a kind of mad rage seized me. Why should my life be ended thus in youth to satisfy the whim of a savage? And if it must be so, why should I go alone?\n\nIn the inside pocket of my ragged coat I had a small loaded pistol with two barrels. One of those barrels would kill Dingaan\u2014at five paces I could not miss that bulk\u2014and the other would blow out my brains, for I was not minded to have my neck twisted or to be beaten to death with sticks. Well, if it was to be done, I had better do it at once. Already my hand was creeping towards the pocket when a new idea, or rather two ideas, struck me.\n\nThe first was that if I shot Dingaan the Zulus would probably massacre Marie and the others\u2014Marie, whose sweet face I should never see again. The second was that while there is life there is hope. Perhaps, after all, he had not sent for an executioner, but for someone else. I would wait. A few minutes more of existence were worth the having.\n\nThe shield-bearer returned, emerging from one of the narrow, reed-hedged passages, and after him came no executioner, but a young white man, who, as I knew from the look of him, was English. He saluted the king by taking off his hat, which I remember was stuck round with black ostrich feathers, then stared at me.\n\n\u201cO Tho-maas\u201d (that is how he pronounced \u201cThomas\u201d), said Dingaan, \u201ctell me if this boy is one of your brothers, or is he a Boer?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe king wants to know if you are Dutch or British,\u201d said the white lad, speaking in English.\n\n\u201cAs British as you are,\u201d I answered. \u201cI was born in England, and come from the Cape.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat may be lucky for you,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the old witch-doctor, Zikali, has told him that he must not kill any English. What is your name? Mine is Thomas Halstead. I am interpreter here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllan Quatermain. Tell Zikali, whoever he may be, that if he sticks to his advice I will give him a good present.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d asked Dingaan suspiciously.\n\n\u201cHe says he is English, no Boer, O king; that he was born across the Black Water, and that he comes from the country out of which all the Boers have trekked.\u201d\n\nAt this intelligence Dingaan pricked up his ears.\n\n\u201cThen he can tell me about these Boers,\u201d he said, \u201cand what they are after, or could if he were able to speak my tongue. I do not trust you to interpret, you Tho-maas, whom I know to be a liar,\u201d and he glowered at Halstead.\n\n\u201cI can speak your tongue, though not very well, O king,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cand I can tell you all about the Boers, for I have lived among them.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Ow!_\u201d said Dingaan, intensely interested. \u201cBut perhaps you are also a liar. Or are you a praying man, like that fool yonder, who is named Oweena?\u201d\u2014he meant the missionary Mr. Owen\u2014\u201cwhom I spare because it is not lucky to kill one who is mad, although he tries to frighten my soldiers with tales of a fire into which they will go after they are dead. As though it matters what happens to them after they are dead!\u201d he added reflectively, taking a pinch of snuff.\n\n\u201cI am no liar,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhat have I to lie about?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would lie to save your own life, for all white men are cowards; not like the Zulus, who love to die for their king. But how are you named?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour people call me Macumazahn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Macumazahn, if you are no liar, tell me, is it true that these Boers rebelled against their king who was named George, and fled from him as the traitor Umsilikazi did from me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, \u201cthat is true.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I am sure that you are a liar,\u201d said Dingaan triumphantly. \u201cYou say that you are English and therefore serve your king, or the _Inkosikaas_\u201d (that is the Great Lady), \u201cwho they tell me now sits in his place. How does it come about then that you are travelling with a party of these very _Amaboona_ who must be your enemies, since they are the enemies of your king, or of her who follows after him?\u201d\n\nNow I knew that I was in a tight place, for on this matter of loyalty, Zulu, and indeed all native ideas, are very primitive. If I said that I had sympathy with the Boers, Dingaan would set me down as a traitor. If I said that I hated the Boers, then still I should be a traitor because I associated with them, and a traitor in his eyes would be one to be killed. I do not like to talk religion, and anyone who has read what I have written in various works will admit that I have done so rarely, if ever. Yet at that moment I put up a prayer for guidance, feeling that my young life hung upon the answer, and it came to me\u2014whence I do not know. The essence of that guidance was that I should tell the simple truth to this fat savage. So I said to him:\n\n\u201cThe answer is this, O king. Among those Boers is a maiden whom I love and who betrothed herself to me since we were \u2018so high.\u2019 Her father took her north. But she sent a message to me saying that her people died of fever and she starved. So I went up in a ship to save her, and have saved her, and those who remained alive of her people with her.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Ow!_\u201d said Dingaan; \u201cI understand that reason. It is a good reason. However many wives he may have, there is no folly that a man will not commit for the sake of some particular girl who is not yet his wife. I have done as much myself, especially for one who was called Nada the Lily, of whom a certain Umslopogaas robbed me, one of my own blood of whom I am much afraid.\u201d\n\nFor a while he brooded heavily, then went on:\n\n\u201cYour reason is good, Macumazahn, and I accept it. More, I promise you this. Perhaps I shall kill these Boers, or perhaps I shall not kill them. But if I make up my mind to kill them, this girl of yours shall be spared. Point her out to Kambula here\u2014not to Tho-maas, for he is a liar and would tell me the wrong one\u2014and she shall be spared.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank you, O king,\u201d I said; \u201cbut what is the use of that if I am to be killed?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not say that you were to be killed, Macumazahn, though perhaps I shall kill you, or perhaps I shall not kill you. It depends upon whether I find you to be a liar, or not a liar. Now the Boer whom Tambusa let go against my wish said that you are a mighty magician as well as a very dangerous man, one who can shoot birds flying on the wing with a bullet, which is impossible. Can you do so?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cVery good, Macumazahn. Now we will see if you are a wizard or a liar. I will make a bet with you. Yonder by your camp is a hill called \u2018Hloma Amabutu,\u2019 a hill of stones where evildoers are slain. This afternoon some wicked ones die there, and when they are dead the vultures will come to devour them. Now this is my bet with you. When those vultures come you shall shoot at them, and if you kill three out of the first five on the wing\u2014not on the ground, Macumazahn\u2014then I will spare these Boers. But if you miss them, then I shall know that you are a liar and no wizard, and I will kill them every one on the hill Hloma Amabutu. I will spare none of them except the girl, whom perhaps I will take as a wife. As to you, I will not yet say what I will do with you.\u201d\n\nNow my first impulse was to refuse this monstrous wager, which meant that the lives of a number of people were to be set against my skill in shooting. But young Thomas Halstead, guessing the words that were about to break from me, said in English:\n\n\u201cAccept unless you are a fool. If you don\u2019t he will cut the throats of every one of them and stick your girl into the _emposeni_\u201d (that is harem), \u201cwhile you will become a prisoner as I am.\u201d\n\nThese were words that I could not resent or neglect, so although despair was in my heart, I said coolly:\n\n\u201cBe it so, O king. I take your wager. If I kill three vultures out of five as they hover over the hill, then I have your promise that all those who travel with me shall be allowed to go hence in safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, Macumazahn; but if you fail to kill them, remember that the next vultures you shoot at shall be those that come to feed upon their flesh, for then I shall know that you are no magician, but a common liar. And now begone, Tho-maas. I will not have you spying on me; and you, Macumazahn, come hither. Although you talk my tongue so badly, I would speak with you about the Boers.\u201d\n\nSo Halstead went, shrugging his shoulders and muttering as he passed me:\n\n\u201cI hope you really _can_ shoot.\u201d\n\nAfter he had left I sat alone for a full hour with Dingaan while he cross-examined me about the Dutch, their movements and their aims in travelling to the confines of his country.\n\nI answered his questions as best I could, trying to make out a good case for them.\n\nAt length, when he grew weary of talking, he clapped his hands, whereon a number of fine girls appeared, two of whom carried pots of beer, from which he offered me drink.\n\nI replied that I would have none, since beer made the hand shake and that on the steadiness of my hand that afternoon depended the lives of many. To do him justice he quite understood the point. Indeed, he ordered me to be conducted back to the camp at once that I might rest, and even sent one of his own attendants with me to hold a shield over my head as I walked so that I should be protected from the sun.\n\n\u201c_Hamba gachle_\u201d (that is \u201cGo softly\u201d), said the wicked old tyrant to me as I departed under the guidance of Kambula. \u201cThis afternoon, one hour before sundown, I will meet you at Hloma Amabutu, and there shall be settled the fate of these _Amaboona_, your companions.\u201d",
    "The doomed three were driven by their murderers into the centre of the depression, within a few yards of which Hans and I were standing.\n\nAfter them came the head executioner, a great brute who wore a curiously shaped leopard-skin cap\u2014I suppose as a badge of office\u2014and held in his hand a heavy kerry, the shaft of which was scored with many notches, each of them representing a human life.\n\n\u201cSee, White Man,\u201d he shouted, \u201chere is the bait which the king sends to draw the holy birds to you. Had it not been that you needed such bait, perhaps these wizards would have escaped. But the Black One said the little Son of George, who is named Macumazahn, needs them that he may show his magic, and therefore they must die to-day.\u201d\n\nNow, at this information I turned positively sick. Nor did it make me feel better when the youngest of the victims, hearing the executioner\u2019s words, flung himself upon his knees, and began to implore me to spare him. His grandfather also addressed me, saying:\n\n\u201cChief, will it not be enough if I die? I am old, and my life does not matter. Or if one is not sufficient, take me and my son, and let the lad, my grandson, go free. We are all of us innocent of any witchcraft, and he is not even old enough to practise such things, being but an unmarried boy. Chief, you, also, are young. Would not your heart be heavy if you had to be slain when the sun of your life was still new in the sky? Think, White Chief, what your father would feel, if you have one, should he be forced to see you killed before his eyes, that some stranger might use your body to show his skill with a magic weapon by slaying the wild things that would eat it.\u201d\n\nNow, almost with tears, I broke in, explaining to the venerable man as well as I could that their horrible fate had nothing to do with me. I told him that I was innocent of their blood, who was forced to be there to try to shoot vultures on the wing in order to save my white companions from a doom similar to their own. He listened attentively, asking a question now and again, and when he had mastered my meaning, said with a most dignified calmness:\n\n\u201cNow I understand, White Man, and am glad to learn that you are not cruel, as I thought. My children,\u201d he added, turning to the others, \u201clet us trouble this _Inkoos_ no more. He only does what he must do to save the lives of his brethren by his skill, if he can. If we continue to plead with him and stir his heart to pity, the sorrow swelling in it may cause his hand to shake, and then they will die also, and their blood be on his head and ours. My children, it is the king\u2019s will that we should be slain. Let us make ready to obey the king, as men of our House have always done. White lord, we thank you for your good words. May you live long, and may good fortune sleep in your hut to the end. May you shoot straight, also, with your magic tool, and thereby win the lives of your company out of the hand of the king. Farewell, _Inkoos_,\u201d and since he could not lift his bound hands in salutation, he bowed to me, as did the others.\n\nThen they walked to a little distance, and, seating themselves on the ground, began to talk together, and after a while to drone some strange chant in unison. The executioners and the guards also sat down not far away, laughing, chatting, and passing a horn of snuff from hand to hand. Indeed, I observed that the captain of them even took some snuff to the victims, and held it in his palm beneath their noses while they drew it up their nostrils and politely thanked him between the sneezes.\n\nAs for myself, I lit a pipe and smoked it, for I seemed to require a stimulant, or, rather, a sedative. Before it was finished Hans, who was engaged in doctoring his scratches made by the vultures\u2019 beaks with a concoction of leaves which he had been chewing, exclaimed suddenly in his matter-of-fact voice:\n\n\u201cSee, baas, here they come, the white people on one side and the black on the other, just like the goats and the sheep at Judgment Day in the Book.\u201d\n\nI looked, and there to my right appeared the party of Boers, headed by the Vrouw Prinsloo, who held the remnants of an old umbrella over her head. To the left advanced a number of Zulu nobles and councillors, in front of whom waddled Dingaan arrayed in his bead dancing dress. He was supported by two stalwart body-servants, whilst a third held a shield over his head to protect him from the sun, and a fourth carried a large stool, upon which he was to sit. Behind each party, also, I perceived a number of Zulus in their war-dress, all of them armed with broad stabbing spears.\n\nThe two parties arrived at the stone upon which I was sitting almost simultaneously, as probably it had been arranged that they should do, and halted, staring at each other. As for me, I sat still upon my stone and smoked on.\n\n\u201cAllemachte! Allan,\u201d puffed the Vrouw Prinsloo, who was breathless with her walk up the hill, \u201cso here you are! As you did not come back, I thought you had run away and left us, like that stinkcat Pereira.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, _Tante_ (aunt), here I am,\u201d I answered gloomily, \u201cand I wish to heaven that I was somewhere else.\u201d\n\nJust then Dingaan, having settled his great bulk upon the stool and recovered his breath, called to the lad Halstead, who was with him, and said:\n\n\u201cO Tho-maas, ask your brother, Macumazahn, if he is ready to try to shoot the vultures. If not, as I wish to be fair, I will give him a little more time to make his magic medicine.\u201d\n\nI replied sulkily that I was as ready as I was ever likely to be.\n\nThen the Vrouw Prinsloo, understanding that the king of the Zulus was before her, advanced upon him, waving her umbrella. Catching hold of Halstead, who understood Dutch, she forced him to translate an harangue, which she addressed to Dingaan.\n\nHad he rendered it exactly as it came from her lips, we should all have been dead in five minutes, but, luckily, that unfortunate young man had learnt some of the guile of the serpent during his sojourn among the Zulus, and varied her vigorous phrases. The gist of her discourse was that he, Dingaan, was a black-hearted and bloody-minded villain, with whom the Almighty would come even sooner or later (as, indeed, He did), and that if he dared to touch one hair of her or of her companions\u2019 heads, the Boers, her countrymen, would prove themselves to be the ministers of the Almighty in that matter (as, indeed, they did). As translated by Halstead into Zulu, what she said was that Dingaan was the greatest king in the whole world; in fact, that there was not, and never had been, any such a king either in power, wisdom, or personal beauty, and that if she and her companions had to die, the sight of his glory consoled them for their deaths.\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Dingaan suspiciously, \u201cif that is what this man-woman says, her eyes tell one story and her lips another. Oh! Tho-maas, lie no more. Speak the true words of the white chieftainess, lest I should find them out otherwise, and give you to the slayers.\u201d\n\nThus adjured, Halstead explained that he had not yet told all the words. The \u201cman-woman,\u201d who was, as he, Dingaan, supposed, a great chieftainess among the Dutch, added that if he, the mighty and glorious king, the earth-shaker, the world-eater, killed her or any of her subjects, her people would avenge her by killing him and his people.\n\n\u201cDoes she say that?\u201d said Dingaan. \u201cThen, as I thought, these Boers are dangerous, and not the peaceful folk they make themselves out to be,\u201d and he brooded for a while, staring at the ground. Presently he lifted his head and went on: \u201cWell, a bet is a bet, and therefore I will not wipe out this handful, as otherwise I would have done at once. Tell the old cow of a chieftainess that, notwithstanding her threats, I stick to my promise. If the little Son of George, Macumazahn, can shoot three vultures out of five by help of his magic, then she and her servants shall go free. If not, the vultures which he has missed shall feed on them, and afterwards I will talk with her people when they come to avenge her. Now, enough of this _indaba_. Bring those evildoers here that they may thank and praise me, who give them so merciful an end.\u201d\n\nSo the grandfather, the father, and the son were hustled before Dingaan by the soldiers, and greeted him with the royal salute of \u201c_bay\u00e8te_.\u201d\n\n\u201cO king,\u201d said the old man, \u201cI and my children are innocent. Yet if it pleases you, O king, I am ready to die, and so is my son. Yet we pray you to spare the little one. He is but a boy, who may grow up to do you good service, as I have done to you and your House for many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe silent, you white-headed dog!\u201d answered Dingaan fiercely. \u201cThis lad is a wizard, like the rest of you, and would grow up to bewitch me and to plot with my enemies. Know that I have stamped out all your family, and shall I then leave him to breed another that would hate me? Begone to the World of Spirits, and tell them how Dingaan deals with sorcerers.\u201d\n\nThe old man tried to speak again, for evidently he loved this grandchild of his, but a soldier struck him in the face, and Dingaan shouted:\n\n\u201cWhat! Are you not satisfied? I tell you that if you say more I will force you to kill the boy with your own hand. Take them away.\u201d\n\nThen I turned and hid my face, as did all the white folk. Presently I heard the old man, whom they had saved to the last that he might witness the deaths of his descendants, cry in a loud voice:\n\n\u201cOn the night of the thirtieth full moon from this day I, the far-sighted, I, the prophet, summon thee, Dingaan, to meet me and mine in the Land of Ghosts, and there to pay\u2014\u201d\n\nThen with a roar of horror the executioners fell on him and he died. When there was silence I looked up, and saw that the king, who had turned a dirty yellow hue with fright, for he was very superstitious, was trembling and wiping the sweat from his brow.\n\n\u201cYou should have kept the wizard alive,\u201d he said in a shaky voice to the head slayer, who was engaged in cutting three more nicks on the handle of his dreadful kerry. \u201cFool, I would have heard the rest of his lying message.\u201d\n\nThe man answered humbly that he thought it best it should remain unspoken, and got himself out of sight as soon as possible. Here I may remark that by an odd coincidence Dingaan actually was killed about thirty moons from that time. Mopo, his general, who slew his brother Chaka, slew him also with the help of Umslopogaas, the son of Chaka. In after years Umslopogaas told me the story of the dreadful ghost-haunted death of this tyrant, but, of course, he could not tell me exactly upon what day it happened. Therefore I do not know whether the prophecy was strictly accurate.\n\nThe three victims lay dead in the hollow of the Hill of Death. Presently the king, recovering himself, gave orders that the spectators should be moved back to places where they could see what happened without frightening the vultures. So the Boers, attended by their band of soldiers, who were commanded to slay them at once if they attempted to escape, went one way, and Dingaan and his Zulus went the other, leaving Hans and myself alone behind our bush. As the white people passed me, Vrouw Prinsloo wished me good luck in a cheerful voice, although I could see that her poor old hand was shaking, and she was wiping her eyes with the _vatdoek_. Henri Marais, also in broken tones, implored me to shoot straight for his daughter\u2019s sake. Then came Marie, pale but resolute, who said nothing, but only looked me in the eyes, and touched the pocket of her dress, in which I knew the pistol lay hid. Of the rest of them I took no notice.",
    "I was awakened on my wedding morning by the crash and bellowing of a great thunderstorm. The lightning flashed fearfully all about us, killing two oxen quite near to my wagon, and the thunder rolled and echoed till the very earth seemed to shake. Then came a wail of cold wind, and after that the swish of torrential rain. Although I was well accustomed to such natural manifestations, especially at this season of the year, I confess that these sights and sounds did not tend to raise my spirits, which were already lower than they should have been on that eventful day. Hans, however, who arrived to help me put on my best clothes for the ceremony, was for once consoling.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look sick, baas,\u201d he said, \u201cfor if there is storm in the morning, there is shine at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, speaking more to myself than to him, \u201cbut what will happen between the storm of the morning and the peace of the night?\u201d\n\nIt was arranged that the commission, which, counting the native after-riders, consisted of over a hundred people, among them several boys, who were little more than children, was to ride at one hour before noon. Nobody could get about to make the necessary preparations until the heavy rain had passed away, which it did a little after eight o\u2019clock. Therefore when I left the wagon to eat, or try to eat some breakfast, I found the whole camp in a state of bustle.\n\nBoers were shouting to their servants, horses were being examined, women were packing the saddle-bags of their husbands and fathers with spare clothes, the pack-beasts were being laden with biltong and other provisions, and so forth.\n\nIn the midst of all this tumult I began to wonder whether my private business would not be forgotten, since it seemed unlikely that time could be found for marriages. However, about ten o\u2019clock when, having done everything that I had to do, I was sitting disconsolately upon my wagon box, being too shy to mix with that crowd of busy mockers or to go to the Prinsloos\u2019 camp to make inquiries, the vrouw herself appeared.\n\n\u201cCome on, Allan,\u201d she said, \u201cthe commandant is waiting and swearing because you are not there. Also, there is another waiting, and oh! she looks lovely. When they see her, every man in the camp will want her for himself, whether he has got a wife or not, for in that matter, although you mayn\u2019t think so just now, they are all the same as the Kaffirs. Oh! I know them, I know them, a white skin makes no difference.\u201d\n\nWhile she held forth thus in her usual outspoken fashion, the vrouw was dragging me along by the hand, just as though I were a naughty little boy. Nor could I get free from that mighty grip, or, when once her great bulk was in motion, match my weight against it. Of course, some of the younger Boers, who, knowing her errand, had followed her, set up a shout of cheers and laughter, which attracted everybody to the procession.\n\n\u201cIt is too late to hang back now, Englishman.\u201d \u201cYou must make the best of a bad business.\u201d \u201cIf you wanted to change your mind, you should have done it before,\u201d men and women roared and screamed with many other such bantering words, till at length I felt myself turn the colour of a red vlei lily.\n\nSo we came at last to where Marie stood, the centre of an admiring circle. She was clothed in a soft white gown made of some simple but becoming stuff, and she wore upon her dark hair a wreath woven by the other maidens in the camp, a bevy of whom stood behind her.\n\nNow we were face to face. Our eyes met, and oh! hers were full of love and trust. They dazzled and bewildered me. Feeling that I ought to speak, and not knowing what to say, I merely stammered \u201cGood morning,\u201d whereon everyone broke into a roar of laughter, except Vrouw Prinsloo, who exclaimed:\n\n\u201cDid any one ever see such a fool?\u201d and even Marie smiled.\n\nThen Piet Retief appeared from somewhere dressed in tall boots and rough riding clothes, such as the Boers wore in those days. Handing the _roer_ he was carrying to one of his sons, after much fumbling he produced a book from his pocket, in which the place was marked with a piece of grass.\n\n\u201cNow then,\u201d he said, \u201cbe silent, all, and show respect, for remember I am not a man just now. I am a parson, which is quite a different thing, and, being a commandant and a veld cornet and other officers all rolled into one, by virtue of the law I am about to marry these young people, so help me God. Don\u2019t any of you witnesses ever say afterwards that they are not rightly and soundly married, because I tell you that they are, or will be.\u201d He paused for breath, and someone said, \u201cHear, hear,\u201d or its Dutch equivalent, whereon, having glared the offender into silence, Retief proceeded:\n\n\u201cYoung man and young woman, what are your names?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask silly questions, commandant,\u201d broke in Vrouw Prinsloo; \u201cyou know their names well enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I do, aunt,\u201d he answered; \u201cbut for this purpose I must pretend not to know them. Are you better acquainted with the law than I am? But stay, where is the father, Henri Marais?\u201d\n\nSomeone thrust Marais forward, and there he stood quite silent, staring at us with a queer look upon his face and his gun in his hand, for he, too, was ready to ride.\n\n\u201cTake away that gun,\u201d said Retief; \u201cit might go off and cause disturbance or perhaps accidents,\u201d and somebody obeyed. \u201cNow, Henri Marais, do you give your daughter to be married to this man?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Marais softly.\n\n\u201cVery well, that is just like you, but it doesn\u2019t matter, for she is of age and can give herself. Is she not of age, Henri Marais? Don\u2019t stand there like a horse with the staggers, but tell me; is she not of age?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe so,\u201d he answered in the same soft voice.\n\n\u201cThen take notice, people all, that this woman is of age, and gives herself to be married to this man, don\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered Marie.\n\n\u201cAll right, now for it,\u201d and, opening the book, he held it up to the light, and began to read, or, rather, to stumble, through the marriage service.\n\nPresently he stuck fast, being, like most Boers of his time, no great scholar, and exclaimed:\n\n\u201cHere, one of you help me with these hard words.\u201d\n\nAs nobody volunteered, Retief handed the book to me, for he knew that Marais would not assist him, saying:\n\n\u201cYou are a scholar, Allan, being a clergyman\u2019s son. Read on till we come to the important bits, and I will say the words after you, which will do just as well and be quite according to law.\u201d\n\nSo I read, Heaven knows how, for the situation was trying enough, until I came to the crucial questions, when I gave the book back.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Retief; \u201cthis is quite easy. Now then, Allan, do you take this woman to be your wife? Answer, putting in your name, which is left blank in the book.\u201d\n\nI replied that I did, and the question was repeated to Marie, who did likewise.\n\n\u201cWell then, there you are,\u201d said Retief, \u201cfor I won\u2019t trouble you with all the prayers, which I don\u2019t feel myself parson enough to say. Oh! no, I forgot. Have you a ring?\u201d\n\nI drew one off my finger that had been my mother\u2019s\u2014I believe it had served this same purpose at the wedding of her grandmother\u2014and set the thin little hoop of gold upon the third finger of Marie\u2019s left hand. I still wear that ring to-day.\n\n\u201cIt should have been a new one,\u201d muttered Vrouw Prinsloo.\n\n\u201cBe silent, aunt,\u201d said Retief; \u201care there any jewellers\u2019 shops here in the veld? A ring is a ring, even if it came off a horse\u2019s bit. There, I think that is all. No, wait a minute, I am going to say a prayer of my own over you, not one out of this book, which is so badly printed that I cannot read it. Kneel down, both of you; the rest may stand, as the grass is so wet.\u201d\n\nNow, bethinking herself of Marie\u2019s new dress, the vrouw produced her _vatdoek_ from a capacious pocket, and doubled up that dingy article for Marie to kneel on, which she did. Then Pieter Retief, flinging down the book, clasped his hands and uttered this simple, earnest prayer, whereof, strangely enough, every word remains fast in my mind. Coming as it did, not from a printed page, but from his honest and believing heart, it was very impressive and solemn.\n\n\n\u201cO God above us, Who sees all and is with us when we are born, when we are married, when we die, and if we do our duty for all time afterwards in Heaven, hear our prayer. I pray Thee bless this man and this woman who appear here before Thee to be wed. Make them love each other truly all their lives, be these long or short, be they sick or well, be they happy or in sorrow, be they rich or poor. Give them children to be reared up in Thy Word, give them an honest name and the respect of all who know them, and at last give them Thy Salvation through the Blood of Jesus the Saviour. If they are together, let them rejoice in each other. If they are apart, let them not forget each other. If one of them dies and the other lives, let that one who lives look forward to the day of reunion and bow the head to Thy Will, and keep that one who dies in Thy holy Hand. O Thou Who knowest all things, guide the lives of these two according to Thy eternal purpose, and teach them to be sure that whatever Thou doest, is done for the best. For Thou art a faithful Creator, Who wishes good to His children and not evil, and at the last Thou wilt give them that good if they do but trust in Thee through daylight and through darkness. Now let no man dare to put asunder those whom Thou hast joined together, O Lord God Almighty, Father of us all. Amen.\u201d\n\nSo he prayed, and all the company echoed that Amen from their hearts. That is all except one, for Henri Marais turned his back on us and walked away.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Retief, wiping his brow with the sleeve of his coat, \u201cyou are the last couple that ever I mean to marry. The work is too hard for a layman who has bad sight for print. Now kiss each other; it is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nSo we kissed, and the congregation cheered.\n\n\u201cAllan,\u201d went on the commandant, pulling out a silver watch like a turnip, \u201cyou have just half an hour before we ride, and the Vrouw Prinsloo says that she has made you a wedding meal in that tent there, so you had best go eat it.\u201d\n\nTo the tent we went accordingly, to find a simple but bounteous feast prepared, of which we partook, helping each other to food, as is, or was, the custom with new-wedded folk. Also, many Boers came in and drank our healths, although the Vrouw Prinsloo told them that it would have been more decent to leave us alone. But Henri Marais did not come or drink our healths.\n\nThus the half-hour went all too swiftly, and not a word did we get alone. At last in despair, seeing that Hans was already waiting with the horses, I drew Marie aside, motioning to everyone to stand back.\n\n\u201cDearest wife,\u201d I said in broken words, \u201cthis is a strange beginning to our married life, but you see it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Allan,\u201d she answered, \u201cit can\u2019t be helped; but oh! I wish my heart were happier about your journey. I fear Dingaan, and if anything should chance to you I shall die of grief.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should anything chance, Marie? We are a strong and well-armed party, and Dingaan looks on us peacefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, husband, but they say Hernan Pereira is with the Zulus, and he hates you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he had better mind his manners, or he will not be here long to hate anybody,\u201d I answered grimly, for my gorge rose at the thought of this man and his treacheries.\n\n\u201cVrouw Prinsloo,\u201d I called to the old lady, who was near, \u201cbe pleased to come hither and listen. And, Marie, do you listen also. If by chance I should hear anything affecting your safety, and send you a message by someone you can trust, such as that you should remove yourselves elsewhere or hide, promise me that you will obey it without question.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I will obey you, husband. Have I not just sworn to do so?\u201d Marie said with a sad smile.\n\n\u201cAnd so will I, Allan,\u201d said the vrouw; \u201cnot because I have sworn anything, but because I know you have a good head on your shoulders, and so will my man and the others of our party. Though why you should think you will have any message to send, I can\u2019t guess, unless you know something that is hidden from us,\u201d she added shrewdly. \u201cYou say you don\u2019t; well, it is not likely you would tell us if you did. Look! They are calling, you must go. Come on, Marie, let us see them off.\u201d",
    "Ten minutes later I stood before Dingaan, who greeted me kindly enough, and began to ask a number of questions about the Boers, especially if they were not people who had rebelled against their own king and run away from him. I answered, Yes, they had run away, as they wanted more room to live; but I had told him all about that when I saw him before. He said he knew I had, but he wished to hear \u201cwhether the same words came out of the same mouth, or different words,\u201d so that he might know if I were a true man or not. Then, after pausing a while, he looked at me in his piercing fashion and asked:\n\n\u201cHave you brought me a present of that tall white girl with eyes like two stars, Macumazahn? I mean the girl whom you refused to me, and whom I could not take because you had won your bet, which gave all the white people to you; she for whose sake you make brothers of these Boers, who are traitors to their king?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, O Dingaan,\u201d I answered; \u201cthere are no women among us. Moreover, this maid is now my wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wife!\u201d he exclaimed angrily. \u201cBy the Head of the Black One, have you dared to make a wife of her whom I desired? Now say, boy, you clever Watcher by Night; you little white ant, who work in the dark and only peep out at the end of your tunnel when it is finished; you wizard, who by your magic can snatch his prey out of the hand of the greatest king in all the world\u2014for it was magic that killed those vultures on Hloma Amabutu, not your bullets, Macumazahn\u2014say, why should I not make an end of you at once for this trick?\u201d\n\nI folded my arms and looked at him. A strange contrast we must have made, this huge, black tyrant with the royal air, for to do him justice he had that, at whose nod hundreds went the way of death, and I, a mere insignificant white boy, for in appearance, at any rate, I was nothing more.\n\n\u201cO Dingaan,\u201d I said coolly, knowing that coolness was my only chance, \u201cI answer you in the words of the Commandant Retief, the great chief. Do you take me for a child that I should give up my own wife to you who already have so many? Moreover, you cannot kill me because I have the word of your captain, Kambula, that I am safe with you.\u201d\n\nThis reply seemed to amuse him. At any rate, with one of those almost infantile changes of mood which are common to savages of every degree, he passed from wrath to laughter.\n\n\u201cYou are quick as a lizard,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should I, who have so many wives, want one more, who would certainly hate me? Just because she is white, and would make the others, who are black, jealous, I suppose. Indeed, they would poison her, or pinch her to death in a month, and then come to tell me she had died of fretting. Also, you are right; you have my safe conduct, and must go hence unharmed this time. But look you, little lizard, although you escape me between the stones, I will pull off your tail. I have said that I want to pluck this tall white flower of yours, and I will pluck her. I know where she dwells. Yes, just where the wagon she sleeps in stands in the line, for my spies have told me, and I will give orders that whoever is killed, she is to be spared and brought to me living. So perhaps you will meet this wife of yours here, Macumazahn.\u201d\n\nNow, at these ominous words, that might mean so much or so little, the sweat started to my brow, and a shiver went down my back.\n\n\u201cPerhaps I shall and perhaps I shall not, O king,\u201d I answered. \u201cThe world is as full of chances to-day as it was not long ago when I shot at the sacred vultures on Hloma Amabutu. Still, I think that my wife will never be yours, O king.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Ow!_\u201d said Dingaan; \u201cthis little white ant is making another tunnel, thinking that he will come up at my back. But what if I put down my heel and crush you, little white ant? Do you know,\u201d he added confidentially, \u201cthat the Boer who mends my guns and whom here we call \u2018Two-faces,\u2019 because he looks towards you Whites with one eye and towards us Blacks with the other, is still very anxious that I should kill you? Indeed, when I told him that my spies said that you were to ride with the Boers, as I had requested that you should be their Tongue, he answered that unless I promised to give you to the vultures, he would warn them against coming. So, since I wanted them to come as I had arranged with him, I promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it so, O king?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd pray why does this Two-faces, whom we name Pereira, desire that I should be killed?\u201d\n\n\u201c_Ow!_\u201d chuckled the obese old ruffian; \u201ccannot you with all your cleverness guess that, O Macumazahn? Perhaps it is he who needs the tall white maiden, and not I. Perhaps if he does certain things for me, I have promised her to him in payment. And perhaps,\u201d he added, laughing quite loud, \u201cI shall trick him after all, keeping her for myself, and paying him in another way, for can a cheat grumble if he is out-cheated?\u201d\n\nI answered that I was an honest man, and knew nothing about cheats, or at what they could or could not grumble.\n\n\u201cYes, Macumazahn,\u201d replied Dingaan quite genially. \u201cThat is where you and I are alike. We are both honest, quite honest, and therefore friends, which I can never be with these Amaboona, who, as you and others have told me, are traitors. We play our game in the light, like men, and who wins, wins, and who loses, loses. Now hear me, Macumazahn, and remember what I say. Whatever happens to others, whatever you may see, you are safe while I live. Dingaan has spoken. Whether I get the tall white girl, or do not get her, still _you_ are safe; it is on my head,\u201d and he touched the gum-ring in his hair.\n\n\u201cAnd why should I be safe if others are unsafe, O king?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOh! if you would know that, ask a certain ancient prophet named Zikali, who was in this land in the days of Senzangacona, my father, and before then\u2014that is, if you can find him. Also, I like you, who are not a flat-faced fool like these Amaboona, but have a brain that turns in and out through difficulties, as a snake does through reeds; and it would be a pity to kill one who can shoot birds wheeling high above him in the air, which no one else can do. So whatever you see and whatever you hear, remember that you are safe, and shall go safely from this land, or stay safely in it if you will, to be my voice to speak with the Sons of George.\n\n\u201cNow return to the commandant, and say to him that my heart is his heart, and that I am very pleased to see him here. To-morrow, and perhaps the next day, I will show him some of the dances of my people, and after that I will sign the writing, giving him all the land he asks and everything else he may desire, more than he can wish, indeed. _Hamba gachl\u00e9_, Macumazahn,\u201d and, rising with surprising quickness from his chair, which was cut out of a single block of wood, he turned and vanished through the little opening in the reed fence behind him that led to his private huts.",
    "Next moment men pounced on me, and before I could utter a word a cloth was thrown over my mouth and tied tight behind my head. I was a prisoner and gagged.\n\nA tall Kaffir, one of the king\u2019s household guards, who carried an assegai, came up to me and whispered:\n\n\u201cHearken, little Son of George. The king would save you, if he can, because you are not Dutch, but English. Yet, know that if you try to cry out, if you even struggle, you die,\u201d and he lifted the assegai so as to be ready to plunge it through my heart.\n\nNow I understood, and a cold sweat broke out all over me. My companions were to be murdered, every one! Oh! gladly would I have given my life to warn them. But alas! I could not, for the cloth upon my mouth was so thick that no sound could pass it.\n\nOne of the Zulus inserted a stick between the reeds of the fence. Working it to and fro sideways, he made an opening just in a line with my eyes\u2014out of cruelty, I suppose, for now I must see everything.\n\nFor some time\u2014ten minutes, I dare say\u2014the dancing and beer-drinking went on. Then Dingaan rose from his chair and shook the hand of Retief warmly, bidding him \u201c_Hamba gachl\u00e9_,\u201d that is, Depart gently, or in peace. He retreated towards the gate of the labyrinth, and as he went the Boers took off their hats, waving them in the air and cheering him. He was almost through it, and I began to breathe again. Doubtless I was mistaken. After all, no treachery was intended.\n\nIn the very opening of the gate Dingaan turned, however, and said two words in Zulu which mean:\n\n\u201cSeize them!\u201d\n\nInstantly the warriors, who had now danced quite close and were waiting for these words, rushed upon the Boers. I heard Thomas Halstead call out in English:\n\n\u201cWe are done for,\u201d and then add in Zulu, \u201cLet me speak to the king!\u201d\n\nDingaan heard also, and waved his hand to show that he refused to listen, and as he did so shouted thrice:\n\n\u201c_Bulala abatagati!_\u201d that is, Slay the wizards!\n\nI saw poor Halstead draw his knife and plunge it into a Zulu who was near him. The man fell, and again he struck at another soldier, cutting his throat. The Boers also drew their knives\u2014those of them who had time\u2014and tried to defend themselves against these black devils, who rushed on them in swarms. I heard afterwards that they succeeded in killing six or eight of them and wounding perhaps a score. But it was soon over, for what could men armed only with pocket-knives do against such a multitude?\n\nPresently, amidst a hideous tumult of shouts, groans, curses, prayers for mercy, and Zulu battle cries, the Boers were all struck down\u2014yes, even the two little lads and the Hottentot servants. Then they were dragged away, still living, by the soldiers, their heels trailing on the ground, just as wounded worms or insects are dragged by the black ants.\n\nDingaan was standing by me now, laughing, his fat face working nervously.\n\n\u201cCome, Son of George,\u201d he said, \u201cand let us see the end of these traitors to your sovereign.\u201d\n\nThen I was pulled along to an eminence within the labyrinth, whence there was a view of the surrounding country. Here we waited a little while, listening to the tumult that grew more distant, till presently the dreadful procession of death reappeared, coming round the fence of the Great Kraal and heading straight for the Hill of Slaughter, Hloma Amabutu. Soon its slopes were climbed, and there among the dark-leaved bushes and the rocks the black soldiers butchered them, every one.\n\nI saw and swooned away.\n\nI believe that I remained senseless for many hours, though towards the end of that time my swoon grew thin, as it were, and I heard a hollow voice speaking over me in Zulu.\n\n\u201cI am glad that the little Son of George has been saved,\u201d said the echoing voice, which I did not know, \u201cfor he has a great destiny and will be useful to the black people in time to come.\u201d Then the voice went on:\n\n\u201cO House of Senzangacona! now you have mixed your milk with blood, with white blood. Of that bowl you shall drink to the dregs, and afterwards must the bowl be shattered\u201d; and the speaker laughed\u2014a deep, dreadful laugh that I was not to hear again for years.\n\nI heard him go away, shuffling along like some great reptile, and then, with an effort, opened my eyes. I was in a large hut, and the only light in the hut came from a fire that burned in its centre, for it was night time. A Zulu woman, young and good-looking, was bending over a gourd near the fire, doing something to its contents. I spoke to her light-headedly.\n\n\u201cO woman,\u201d I said, \u201cis that a man who laughed over me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot altogether, Macumazahn,\u201d she answered in a pleasant voice. \u201cThat was Zikali, the Mighty Magician, the Counsellor of Kings, the Opener of Roads; he whose birth our grandfathers do not remember; he whose breath causes the trees to be torn out by the roots; he whom Dingaan fears and obeys.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he cause the Boers to be killed?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cMayhap,\u201d she answered. \u201cWho am I that I should know of such matters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you the woman who was sick whom I was sent to visit?\u201d I asked again.\n\n\u201cYes, Macumazahn, I was sick, but now I am well and you are sick, for so things go round. Drink this,\u201d and she handed me a gourd of milk.\n\n\u201cHow are you named?\u201d I inquired as I took it.\n\n\u201cNaya is my name,\u201d she replied, \u201cand I am your jailer. Don\u2019t think that you can escape me, though, Macumazahn, for there are other jailers without who carry spears. Drink.\u201d",
    "\u201cAllan Quatermain,\u201d said the commandant, \u201cyou are brought here to be tried by a court-martial duly constituted according to the law published in the camps of the emigrant Boers. Do you acknowledge that law?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that there is such a law, commandant,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut I do not acknowledge the authority of your court-martial to try a man who is no Boer, but a subject of the Queen of Great Britain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have considered that point, Allan Quatermain,\u201d said the commandant, \u201cand we disallow it. You will remember that in the camp at Bushman\u2019s River, before you rode with the late Pieter Retief to the chief Sikonyela, when you were given command of the Zulus who went with him, you took an oath to interpret truly and to be faithful in all things to the General Retief, to his companions and to his cause. That oath we hold gives this court jurisdiction over you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI deny your jurisdiction,\u201d I answered, \u201calthough it is true that I took an oath to interpret faithfully, and I request that a note of my denial may be made in writing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt shall be done,\u201d said the commandant, and laboriously he made the note on the paper before him.\n\nWhen he had finished he looked up and said: \u201cThe charge against you, Allan Quatermain, is that, being one of the commission who recently visited the Zulu king Dingaan, under command of the late Governor and General Pieter Retief, you did falsely and wickedly urge the said Dingaan to murder the said Pieter Retief and his companions, and especially Henri Marais, your father-in-law, and Hernando Pereira, his nephew, with both of whom you had a quarrel. Further, that afterwards you brought about the said murder, having first arranged with the king of the Zulus that you should be removed to a place of safety while it was done. Do you plead Guilty or Not guilty?\u201d\n\nNow when I heard this false and abominable charge my rage and indignation caused me to laugh aloud.\n\n\u201cAre you mad, commandant,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cthat you should say such things? On what evidence is this wicked lie advanced against me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Allan Quatermain, I am not mad,\u201d he replied, \u201calthough it is true that through your evil doings I, who have lost my wife and three children by the Zulu spears, have suffered enough to make me mad. As for the evidence against you, you shall hear it. But first I will write down that you plead Not guilty.\u201d\n\nHe did so, then said:\n\n\u201cIf you will acknowledge certain things it will save us all much time, of which at present we have little to spare. Those things are that knowing what was going to happen to the commission, you tried to avoid accompanying it. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I answered. \u201cI knew nothing of what was going to happen to the commission, though I feared something, having but just saved my friends there\u201d\u2014and I pointed to the Prinsloos\u2014\u201cfrom death at the hands of Dingaan. I did not wish to accompany it for another reason: that I had been married on the day of its starting to Marie Marais. Still, I went after all because the General Retief, who was my friend, asked me to come, to interpret for him.\u201d\n\nNow some of the Boers present said:\n\n\u201cThat is true. We remember.\u201d\n\nBut the commandant continued, taking no heed of my answer or these interruptions.\n\n\u201cDo you acknowledge that you were on bad terms with Henri Marais and with Hernan Pereira?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered; \u201cbecause Henri Marais did all in his power to prevent my marriage with his daughter Marie, behaving very ill to me who had saved his life and that of his people who remained to him up by Delagoa, and afterwards at Umgungundhlovu. Because, too, Hernan Pereira strove to rob me of Marie, who loved me. Moreover, although I had saved him when he lay sick to death, he afterwards tried to murder me by shooting me down in a lonely place. Here is the mark of it,\u201d and I touched the little scar upon the side of my forehead.\n\n\u201cThat is true; he did so, the stinkcat,\u201d shouted the Vrouw Prinsloo, and was ordered to be silent.\n\n\u201cDo you acknowledge,\u201d went on the commandant, \u201cthat you sent to warn your wife and those with her to depart from the camp on the Bushman\u2019s River, because it was going to be attacked, charging them to keep the matter secret, and that afterwards both you and your Hottentot servant alone returned safely from Zululand, where all those who went with you lie dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI acknowledge,\u201d I answered, \u201cthat I wrote to tell my wife to come to this place where I had been building houses, as you see, and to bring with her any of our companions who cared to trek here, or, failing that, to go alone. This I did because Dingaan had told me, whether in jest or in earnest I did not know, that he had given orders that my said wife should be kidnapped, as he desired to make her one of his women, having thought her beautiful when he saw her. Also what I did was done with the knowledge and by the wish of the late Governor Retief, as can be shown by his writing on my letter. I acknowledge also that I escaped when all my brothers were killed, as did the Hottentot Hans, and if you wish to know I will tell you how we escaped and why.\u201d"

  "Talbot Mundy -- The Lion of Petra": [
    "This isn't an animal story. No lions live at Petra nowadays, at any rate, no four-legged ones; none could have survived competition with the biped. Unquestionably there were tamer, gentler, less assertive lions there once, real yellow cats with no worse inconveniences for the casual stranger than teeth, claws, and appetites. The Assyrian kings used to come and hunt near Petra, and brag about it afterward; after you have well discounted the lies they made their sculptors tell on huge stone monoliths when they got back home, they remain a pretty peppery line of potentates. But for imagination, self-esteem, ambition, gall, and picturesque depravity they were children--mere chickens--compared to the modern gentleman whom Grim and I met up with A.D. 1920.\n\nYou can't begin at the beginning of a tale like this, because its roots reach too far back into ancient history. If, on the other hand, you elect to start at the end and work backward the predicament confronts you that there wasn't any end, nor any in sight. As long as the Lion of Petra has a desert all about him and a choice of caves, a camel within reach, and enough health to keep him feeling normal--never mind whose camel it is, nor what power claims to control the desert--there will be trouble for somebody and sport for him.\n\nSo, since it can have no end and no beginning, you might define this as an episode--a mere interval between pipes, as it were, in the amusing career of Ali Higg ben Jhebel ben Hashim, self-styled Lion of Petra, Lord of the Wells, Chief of the Chiefs of the Desert, and Beloved of the Prophet of Al-Islam; not forgetting, though, that his career was even supposed to amuse his victims or competitors. The fun is his, the fury other people's.\n\nThe beginning as concerns me was when I moved into quarters in Grim's mess in Jerusalem. As a civilian and a foreigner I could not have done that, of course, if it had been a real mess; but Grim, who gets fun out of side-stepping all regulations, had established a sort of semi-military boarding-house for junior officers who were tired of tents, and he was too high up in the Intelligence Department for anybody less than the administrator to interfere with him openly. He did exactly as he pleased in that and a great many other matters--did things that no British-born officer would have dared do (because they are all crazy about precedent) but what they were all very glad to have Grim do, because he was a bally American, don't you know, and it was dashed convenient and all that. And Grim was a mighty good fellow, even if he did like syrup on his sausages.\n\nThe main point was that Grim was efficient. He delivered the goods. He was perfectly willing to quit at any time if they did not like his methods; and they did not want him to quit, because there is nothing on earth more convenient for men in charge of public affairs than to have a good man on their string who can be trusted to break all rules and use horse-sense on suitable occasion.\n\nI had been in the mess about two days, I think, doing nothing except read Grim's books and learn Arabic, when I noticed signs of impending activity. Camel saddles began to be brought out from somewhere behind the scenes, carefully examined, and put away again. Far-sighted men with the desert smell on them, which is more subtly stirring and romantic than all other smells, kept coming in to squat on the rugs in the library and talk with Grim about desert trails, and water, and what tribal feuds were in full swing and which were in abeyance.\n\nThen, about the fourth or fifth day, the best two camel saddles were thrown into a two-wheeled cart and sent off somewhere, along with a tent, camp-beds, canned goods, and all the usual paraphernalia a white man seems to need when he steps out of his cage into the wild.\n\nI was reading when that happened, sitting in the arm-chair facing Grim, suppressing the impulse to ask questions, and trying to appear unaware that anything was going on. But it seemed to me that there was too much provision made for one man, even for a month, and I had hopes. However, Grim is an aggravating cuss when so disposed, and he kept me waiting until the creaking of the departing cart-wheels and the blunt bad language of the man who drove the mules could no longer be heard through the open window.\n\n\"Had enough excitement?\" he asked me then.\n\n\"There's not enough to be had,\" said I, pretending to continue reading.\n\n\"Care to cut loose out of bounds?\"\n\n\"Try me.\"\n\n\"The desert's no man's paradise this time o' year. Hotter than Billy-be- ----, and no cops looking after the traffic. They'll shoot a man for his shoe-leather.\"\n\n\"Any man can have my shoes when I can't use 'em.\"\n\n\"Heard of Petra?\"\n\nI nodded as casually as I could. Everybody who has been to Palestine has heard of that place, where an inaccessible city was carved by the ancients out of solid rock, only to be utterly forgotten for centuries until Burkhardt rediscovered it.\n\n\"Heard too much. I don't believe a word of it.\"\n\n\"There's a problem there to be straightened out,\" said Grim. \"It's away and away beyond the British border; too far south for the Damascus government to reach; too far north for the king of Mecca; too far east for us; much too far west for the Mespot outfit. East of the sun and west of the moon you might say. There's a sheikh there by the name of Ali Higg. I'm off to tackle him. Care to come?\"\n\n\"When do we start?\"\n\n\"Now, from here. Tonight from Hebron. I'll give you time to make your will, write to your lady-love, and crawl out if you care to. Ali Higg is hot stuff. Suppose we leave it this way: I'll go on to Hebron. You think it over. You can overtake me at Hebron any time before tonight, and if you do, all right; but if second thoughts make you squeamish about crucifixion--they tell me that Ali Higg makes a specialty of that--I'll say you're wise to stay where you are. In any case I start from Hebron tonight. Suit yourself.\"",
    "De Crespigny went to the door and Grim and I squatted cross-legged in the window-seat. I tried to feel like a middle-aged native of the East under the rule of that twenty-six-year-old governor; but it couldn't be done. I don't know yet what the sensations are of, say, a bachelor of arts of Lahore University who has to take orders from a British subaltern. I expect you have to leave off pretending and really be an Indian to find out that; otherwise your liking for the fellow himself offsets reason. No white man could have helped liking young de Crespigny.\n\nHe came in after a minute perfectly self-possessed, leading a young woman who took your breath away. I have heard all the usual stories about the desert women being hags, but every one of them was pure fiction to me from that minute. If all the rest were really what men said of them, this one was sufficiently amazing to redeem the lot. De Crespigny addressed her as Princess, and she may have really ranked as one for all I know.\n\nShe sat on a chair, rather awkwardly, as if not used to it, and we stared at her like a row of owls, she studying us in return, quite unabashed. The Badawi don't wear veils, and are not in the least ashamed to air their curiosity. She stared uncommonly hard at Grim.\n\nOf middle height, supple and slender, with the grace of all outdoors, smiling with a dignity that did not challenge and yet seemed to arm her against impertinence, not very dark, except for her long eyelashes--I have seen Italians and Greeks much darker--she somewhat resembled the American Indian, only that her face was more mobile. Part of her beauty was sheer art, contrived by the cunning arrangement of the shawl on her head, and kohl on her eyelashes. This young woman knew every trick of deportment down to the outward thrust of a shapely bare foot in an upturned Turkish slipper. Her clothing was linen, not black cotton that Bedouin women usually wear, and much of it was marvelously hand-embroidered; but all the jewelry she wore was a necklace made of gold coins. It gave a finishing touch of opulence that is the crown of finished art.\n\nBut it was her eyes that took your breath away, and she was perfectly aware of it; she used them as the desert does all its weapons, frankly and without reluctance, sparing no consideration for the weak--rather looking for weakness to take advantage of it. They were wise--dark, deadly wise--alight with youth, and yet amazingly acquainted with all evil that is older than the world. She was obviously not in the least afraid of us.\n\n\"You are from El-Maan?\" asked de Crespigny, and she nodded.\n\n\"Did you come all this way alone?\"\n\n\"No woman travels the desert alone.\"\n\n\"Tell me how you got here.\"\n\n\"You know how I got here. I came with a caravan that carried wheat--the wife of the sheikh of the caravan consenting.\"\n\nShe spoke the clean concrete Arabic of the desert, that has a distinct word for everything, and for every phase of everything--another speech altogether from the jargon of the towns.\n\n\"Are they friends of yours?\"\n\n\"Who travels with enemies?\"\n\n\"Did you know them, I mean, before you came with them?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you are not from El-Maan?\"\n\n\"Who said I was?\"\n\n\"I thought you did.\"\n\n\"Nay, the words were yours, khawaja.\"\n\n\"Please tell me where you come from.\"\n\n\"From beyond El-Maan.\"\n\nShe made a gesture with one hand and her shoulder that suggested illimitable distances.\n\n\"From which place beyond El-Maan?\"\n\nShe laughed, and you felt she did it not in self-defense, but out of sheer amusement.\n\n\"Ask the jackal where his hole is! My people live in tents.\"\n\n\"Well, Princess, tell me, at any rate, what you are doing here in El-Kalil.\"\n\n\"Ask El-Kalil. The whole _suk_ talks of me. I have made purchases.\"\n\n\"That's what I'm getting at. You've made some unusual purchases, and you've sent to Jerusalem for things that people don't use as a rule in tents out in the desert--silk stockings, for instance, and a phonograph with special records, and soft pillows, and writing-paper, and odds and ends like that. Do you use those things?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Do you use books in French and English?\"\n\nShe hesitated. It was the first time she had not seemed perfectly at ease.\n\n\"Can you even read Arabic?\"\n\nShe did not answer.\n\n\"Then the books, at any rate, are meant for some one else? Tell me who that some one is.\"\n\n\"Allah! May I not buy what I will, if I pay for it?\"",
    "\"Government wages!\" Grim answered firmly. The old Arab smiled.\n\n\"Under the Turks,\" he answered, \"the officer pocketed the pay, and the men might help themselves.\"\n\n\"D'you take me for a Turk?\" asked Grim.\n\n\"No, Jimgrim. I know you for a cunning contriver--an upsetter of calculations--but no Turk. Nevertheless, as I understand it, we go against Ali Higg, who calls himself the Lion of Petra. Sheikh Ali Higg has amassed a heap of plunder--hundreds of camels--merchandise taken from the caravans; that should be ours for the lifting. That is honest. That is reasonable.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it!\" said Grim. \"Let's get that clear before we start. I know your game. You've got it all fixed up between yourselves to stick with me until Ali Higg is _mafish_ and then bolt for the skyline with the plunder. Not a bit of use arguing--I know. You shouldn't talk your plans over in coffee-shop corners if you don't want me to hear of them.\"\n\n\"Jimgrim, you are the devil!\"\n\n\"Maybe. But let's understand each other. Your property in Hebron is all listed. We'll call that a pledge for good behavior. You and your men are going to have government rifles served out to you that you'll have to account for afterward. Every rifle missing when we get back, and every scrap of loot you lay your hands on, will be charged double against your Hebron property. On the other hand, if any camels die you shall be reimbursed. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Clear? A camel in the dark could understand it! But listen, Jimgrim.\"\n\nThe venerable sire of rogues went and sat crosslegged on the window-seat, evidently meaning to debate the point. If an Arab loves one thing more than a standing argument it is that same thing sitting down.\n\n\"We go against Ali Higg. That is no light matter. He will send his men against us, and that is no light matter either. They are heretics without hope of paradise and bent on seeing hell before their time! Surely they will come to loot our camp in the dark. Shall we not defend ourselves?\"\n\nBut Grim was not disposed to stumble into any traps.\n\n\"Does a loaded camel on the level trouble about hills?\" he asked.\n\nBut Ali Baba waved the question aside as irrelevant.\n\n\"They come. We defend ourselves. One, or maybe two, or even more of Ali Higg's scoundrels are slain. Behold a blood-feud! Jimgrim and his friends depart for El-Kudz or elsewhere; Ali Baba and his sons have a feud on their hands. Now a feud, Jimgrim, has its price! It would do my old heart good to see the blood of Ali Higg and his heretics, for it is written that we should smite the heretic and spare not. But we should also despoil him of his goods, or the Prophet will not be pleased with us!\"\n\n\"That is the talk of a rooster on a dung-hill,\" Grim answered. \"A rooster crows a mile away. Another answers with a challenge, but the camels draw the plow in ten fields between them. That is like a blood-feud between you and Ali Higg. Five days' march from here to Petra and how many deserts and tribes between?\"\n\n\"So much the easier to keep the loot when we have won it!\" answered Ali Baba.\n\n\"There's going to be no loot!\" said Grim.\n\n\"Allah!\"\n\n\"Would you rather have me send back to Jerusalem for regular police?\"\n\n\"Nay, Jimgrim! That would be the end of you, for those police would bungle everything. You need clever fellows with you if you go to sup with Ali Higg.\"\n\n\"Well? Are you coming?\"\n\n_\"Taib._ We are ready. But--\"\n\n\"On my terms!\"\n\n\"But the pay is nothing!\"\n\n\"So is my pay nothing! This man\"--he pointed to me--\"gets no pay at all. Narayan Singh, the Sikh, gets less pay than a policeman.\"\n\n\"Then what is the profit?\"\n\n\"For you? The honor of keeping your word. The privilege of making fair return for past immunity. Why aren't you and all your sons in jail this minute? Why did I invite you to come with me on this occasion? Because a man looks for friends where he has given favors! But if you consider you owe the administration nothing for forgiving all past offenses, very well; I'll look for friends elsewhere.\"\n\n\"As for the administration, Jimgrim, may Allah turn its face cold! But you are another matter. We will come with you.\"\n\n\"On my terms?\"\n\n_\"Taib.\"_",
    "The village Arabs are perfunctory about prayer, unless unctuous strangers are in sight, who might criticize. So, although we approached at prayer-time, it was hardly a minute after we rose in view over a low dune before a good number of men were on the wall gazing in our direction. And before we had come within a mile of the place the west gate opened and a string of camel-men rode out. The man at their head was the sheikh by the look of him, for we could see his striped silk head-dress even at that distance, and he seemed to have a modern rifle as against the spears and long-barreled muskets of the others. There were about two-score of them, and they rode like the wind in a half circle, with the obvious intention of surrounding us. Grim led straight on.\n\nThey rode around and around us once or twice before the man in the striped head-gear called a halt. He seemed disturbed by Grim's nonchalance, and asked our business with not more than half a challenge in his voice.\n\n\"Water,\" Grim answered. \"Did Allah make no wells in these parts?\"\n\nIt doesn't pay to do as much as even to suggest your real reason for visiting an Arab village, for they won't believe you in any case.\n\n\"What have you in the _shibriyah?\"_\n\n\"Come and see.\"\n\nThe Sheikh Mahommed Abbas drew near alone, suspiciously, with his cocked rifle laid across his lap. His men began moving again, circling around us slowly--I suppose with the idea of annoying us; for that is an old trick, to irritate your intended victim until some ill-considered word or gesture gives excuse for an attack. But we all sat our camels stock-still, and, following Grim's example, kept our rifles slung behind us.\n\nThe sheikh was a rather fine-looking fellow, except for smallpox marks. He had a hard eye, and a nose like an eagle's beak; and that sort of face is always wonderfully offset by a pointed black beard such as he wore. But there was something about the way he sat his camel that suggested laziness, and his lips were not thin and resolute enough to my mind, to match that beard and nose. I would have bet on three of a kind against him sky-high, even if he had passed the draw.\n\nHe drew aside the curtain of the _shibriyah_ gingerly, as if he expected a trick mechanism that might explode a bomb in his face.\n\n_\"Mashallah!_ Where is the woman?\" he exclaimed.\n\nI found out then that I was right as to the way to play that supposititious poker hand. Grim had doped him out too, and answered promptly without changing a muscle of his face.\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ Should I bring my wife to this place?\"\n\n\"Allah! Thy wife?\"\n\n\"Whose else?\"\n\n\"It was Ali Higg's wife according to the tale!\"\n\n\"Some fools swallow tales as the dogs eat the offal thrown to them! By the beard of God's Prophet, whom do you take me for?\"\n\n_\"Kif?_* How should I know?\"\n\n\"Go and ask the kites, then, at Dat Ras!\"\n\n\"You are he? You are he who slew the--_Shi ajib!_* Now I think of it they did say he was beardless. Nay! Are you--Speak! Who are you?\"\n\n\"Does your wife wander abroad while you herd cattle?\" Grim asked him.\n\n\"Allah forbid! But--\"\n\n\"Is my honor likely less than yours?\"\n\n\"Then you are Ali Higg?\"\n\n\"Who else?\"\n\n\"And these?\"\n\n\"My servants.\"\n\n\"Your honor travels abroad with a scant escort!\"\n\n\"Let us see, then, whether it is not enough! A tale was told me of a black-faced liar on a Bishareen dromedary who fled hither from El-Kalil last night to persuade the dogs of this place to bark in some hunt of his. There was mention made of a woman. My men pursued him along the road, but fear gave him wings. Hand him over!\"\n\n\"Allah! He is my guest.\"\n\n\"Or let us see whether I cannot fire one shot and summon enough men to eat this place!\"\n\n\"That is loud talk. They tell me you travel with but twenty.\"\n\n\"Try me!\"\n\n\nYou didn't have to be much of a thought-reader to know what was passing in that sheikh's mind. Supposing that Grim were really the notorious Ali Higg, he might easily have left Hebron with twenty men and have been joined by fifty or a hundred others in the night. Or there might be others on the way to meet him now. It was a big risk, for Ali Higg's vengeance was always the same; he simply turned a horde of men loose to work their will on the inhabitants of any village that defied him. The sheikh was not quite sure yet that he really sat face to face with the redoubtable robber, yet did not dare put that doubt to the test.\n\n\"Is that all Your Honor wants?\" he asked. \"Just that messenger?\"\n\n\"Him and his camel--and another thing.\"\n\n\"What else, then? We are poor folk in this place. There has been a bad season. We have neither corn nor money.\"\n\n\"If I needed corn or money I would come and take them,\" Grim answered. \"I have no present need. I give an order.\"\n\n\"Allah! What then?\"\n\n\"It pleases me to camp yonder.\"\n\nHe made a lordly motion with his head toward the west.\n\n\"This side your village, then, all this day until sundown, none of your people venture.\"\n\n\"But our camels go to graze that way.\"\n\n\"Not this day. Today yours graze to the eastward.\"\n\n\"There is poor grazing to the eastward.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, whoever ventures to the westward all this day does so in despite of me, and the village pays the price!\"\n\n\"Allah!\"\n\n\"Let Allah witness!\" answered Grim.\n\nAnd his face was an enigma; but half the puzzle was already solved because there was no suggestion of weakness there. It was the best piece of sheer bluffing on a weak hand that I had ever seen.\n\n\"Will Your Honor not visit my town and break bread with me?\" asked Mahommed Abbas.\n\n\"If I visit that dung-hill it will be to burn it,\" Grim answered. \"Send me out that black-faced liar and the Bishareen. I am not pleased to wait long in the sun.\"\n\n\"If we obey the command do we not merit Your Honor's favor?\"\n\nThat was a very shrewd question. A weak man with a weak hand would have walked into that trap by betraying the spirit of compromise. On the other hand an ordinary bluffer would have blundered by overdoing the high hand.\n\n\"Consider what is known of me,\" Grim answered. \"How many have disobeyed me and escaped? How many have obeyed and regretted it? But by the beard of Allah's Prophet,\" he thundered suddenly, \"I grow weary of words! What son of sixty dogs dares keep me waiting in the desert while he barks?\"\n\nMahommed Abbas did not like that medicine, especially in front of all his men. But they had ceased circling long ago and were waiting stock-still at a respectful distance; for the name of Ali Higg meant evidently more to them than the honor of their own sheikh--which at best depends on the sheikh's own generalship. It was a safe bet that if he had called on them to attack that minute they would have declined.\n\nSo he gave the dignified Arab salute, which Grim deigned to acknowledge with the slightest possible inclination of the head, and led his men away.\n\n\"What would you have done if he had called your bluff?\" I asked Grim, as soon as they were all out of earshot.\n\n\"Dunno,\" he said, smiling. \"I've learned never to try a bluff unless I'm pretty sure of my man. That guy doesn't own many chips. As a last resort I'd have to admit I'm a government officer--if they hadn't killed us all first!\"",
    "While we were eating breakfast in a circle in front of the tents, all sticking our right hands into a common mess-pan and eating like wolves--you have to be awfully careful not to use your left hand, and unless you eat fast you'll get less than your share--there came five men on camels out of a wady--a shallow valley that lay like a cut throat with red rocks on its edge something over a mile away beyond the egg-shaped rock. They were armed--as everybody is in those parts who hopes to live--and in a hurry.\n\nAyisha and her people did not see them, because the great rock was in the way, but we left off eating to watch, and Grim went into his tent to use field-glasses without being seen. It is not unheard of for an Arab sheikh to use Zeiss binoculars, but it might make a stranger suspicious.\n\nThe five men came on at a gallop, sending up the dust in clouds like a cruiser's smoke-screen. They seemed to take it for granted that we were friends, for we were in full view and far outnumbered them, yet they did not check for an instant, and that in itself was a suspicious circumstance.\n\nThey came to a halt ten yards away from Ayisha's tent, and stared at her in silence, realizing, apparently for the first time, that they had come within rifle-shot of strangers. We could see her talking to them, but could not hear what she said. Perhaps that was as well. I think that even Grim with his poker face in perfect working order would have been flustered if he had been given time to think. The surprise, when it came, made him brace himself to meet it; and, once committed, he played with the sky for a limit as usual.\n\nOne thing was quite clear: Ayisha had made herself known to them, and they were properly impressed. They dismounted from their camels, and, after bowing to her as respectfully as any lord of the desert decently could do to a woman, they left their beasts kneeling and started all together toward us.\n\nSo Grim went out to meet them, even outdoing their measured dignity, striding as if the desert were his heritage. But he went only as far as the railway track, and waited; to have gone a step farther would have made them think themselves his superiors. Ali Baba, Mujrim, Narayan Singh, and I, went out and stood behind him at a properly respectful distance.\n\nEvery detail of a man's bearing is watched carefully in that land. Every action has its value. The etiquette of the desert is more strict, and more dangerous to neglect, than that of palaces, although it is simpler and more to the point, being based on the instinct of self-preservation.\n\nThe Arabs who approached us, having ridden straight into a trap for all they knew, for they had expected friends and found strangers, were even more than usually observant of formality. They were fierce, fine-looking fellows, possessed of that dignity that only warfare with the desert breeds, and they saluted Grim with the punctilio of men who know the meaning of a fight to him who doubtless understands it too. A very different matter, that, to raising your Stetson on Broadway, with two cops on the corner and the Stars and Stripes floating from the hotel roof. They eyed Grim the while in the same sort of way that men who might be charged with trespass look at the game warden, waiting for him to speak first.\n\n_\"Allah ysabbak bilkhair!\"_ he rolled out at last.\n\n_\"Allah y'a fik, ya Ali Higg!\"_ they answered one after the other.\n\nAnd then the oldest of them--a black-bearded stalwart with extremely aquiline nose and dark-brown eyes that fairly gleamed from under the linen head-dress, took on himself the role of spokesman.\n\n\"O Ali Higg! May Allah give you peace!\"\n\n\"And to you peace!\" Grim answered.\n\nI could not see Grim's face, of course, since I stood behind him, but I did not detect the least movement of surprise or nervousness. He stood as if he were used to being called by that name, but the rest of us did not dare look at one another. Once across that railway-line we were in the real Ali Higg's preserves. It occurred to me at the moment as vastly safer to pose as the U.S. President in Washington.\n\nStill, Grim had not actually accepted the situation yet. I held my breath, trying to remember to look like a product of Lahore University.\n\n\"We were on our way to El-Maan, O Ali Higg, not knowing that your honor had a hand in this affair.\"\n\n\"Since when is a lion not called a lion?\" demanded Grim. \"Who gave thee leave to name me?\"\n\n\"Pardon, O Lion of Petra! But the woman yonder, boasting with proper pride that she is Your Honor's wife, bade us approach and pay respect.\"\n\nOn my left I heard Narayan Singh muttering obscenities through set teeth. On the right old Ali Baba wore a twinkle in a wicked eye; the rest of his face was as emotionless as the face of the desert; but when an old man is amused not even the crow's-feet can do less than advertise the fact.\n\n\"A woman's tongue is like a camel bell,\" said Grim. \"It clatters unceasingly, and none can silence it without choking it. But art thou a woman?\"\n\n\"Pardon, O Lion of Petra!\"\n\nThere followed a long pause. When men meet in the desert it is only those from the West who are in any hurry to betray their business. There being an infinity of time, that man is a liar who proclaims a shortage of it.\n\n\"Will the sun not rise tomorrow?\" asks the East.\n\nGrim stood like a statue; and, judging by my own feelings, who had nothing at all to do but look on, I should say that was a test of strength.\n\n\"Last week the train was punctual at El-Maan--three hours after sunrise,\" said the spokesman at last.\n\nOn lines where there is only one train a week it is not unusual for its arrival to be the chief social event on the country-side, but that hardly seemed to me to account for the way those five men had been driving their camels. However, as Grim knew no more of their business than the rest of us, and needed desperately to find out, he was careful to ask no questions.\n\nNo desert responds to the inquisitive folk who camp on its edge and demand to be told; but it will tell you all it knows if you keep quiet and govern yourself in accordance with its moods. The men who live in the desert are of the same pattern--fierce, hot, cold, intolerant, cruel, secretive, given to covering their tracks, and yet not without oases that are better than much fine gold to the man who knows how to find them. They enjoy a proverb better than some other men like promises.\n\n\"Allah marks the flight of birds. Shall He not decree a train's journey?\" said Grim.\n\n_\"Inshallah,_ Lion of Petra! The train will come, when that is written, and that which is written shall befall. It is said there are sons of corruption on the train, who bear much wealth with them. It were a pity to leave all the looting to those who got to El-Maan soonest. They who slay will claim the booty. Or does Your Honor intend to arrive afterward and claim a share, leaving the labor to those who seek labor? In that case we crave permission to join Your Honor's party. It may be we can help enforce Your Honor's just demands, and be recompensed accordingly?\"\n\n_\"Wallahi!\"_ Grim answered after a long pause. \"Who sets himself to plunder trains without my leave? Have I been such short time in Petra that men doubt who rules here? Have I not said the train shall pass El-Maan and come thus far? Who dares challenge me? Do I wait here for nothing? Shall I be satisfied with a string of empty cars?\"\n\nThe Arab turned and conferred for a moment with his four friends. They shook their heads.\n\n\"O Lord of the Desert,\" he said after a minute, \"none has heard of this decree. Your Honor's messenger may have failed or have fallen into bad hands on the way. Word has not come that you reserve this train for your own profit. There will be fifty men at El-Maan now waiting to slay certain passengers and plunder others.\"\n\nGrim had evidently made up his mind and had set full sail on the course indicated. I confess I shuddered at the prospect; but I never saw a man look more pleased than Ali Baba, and Narayan Singh's face betrayed militant admiration. Nor have I ever heard such a streak of fulminous bad language as Grim swore then, calling earth and all its elements to witness the brimstone anger of a robber chief.\n\n\"Go ye,\" he thundered, \"and tell those sons of swine that I say the train shall pass to this point. And as to what happens thereafter that is my affair. Bid any and all who chose to dispute my word to look first to their wives and goods. I have spoken.\"\n\nThe five men fell back a pace in consternation, no doubt partly affected for the sake of flattery; but they were quite obviously disconcerted.\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ If we go on such an errand who shall save our lives? Who are we to come between wolves and their prey?\"\n\n\"Say ye are my messengers,\" retorted Grim. \"Let any touch a messenger of mine who dares.\"\n\n\"But they will not believe us.\"\n\n\"That is their affair. It is Allah's way to make blind those who it is written are to be destroyed.\"\n\n\"Nay, Lion of Petra, give a man to go with us--one whom they will know and recognize. Then all shall be well.\"",
    "El-Maan itself was a picture of green trees above a mud wall; but we did not visit it, for the station, with its hideous red water-tanks, was a mile and a half to the eastward of the place--a miserable, bleak, unpainted iron roof and buildings, with a place alongside that had once been a Greek hotel. At present it looked like a camel-mart; but there were dozens of horses there too, gaudily turned out like the camels with red worsted trimmings on saddles and bridles. And as for the fifty men our five new acquaintances had spoken of, there were a hundred and fifty if one, all herded in groups, each with a rifle over his arm or slung across his shoulder. Their talk ceased as we rode along the track, and those who were on the platform--about half of them--eyed Ayisha with as much curiosity as a Bedouin taken by surprise ever permits himself to betray.\n\nShe did not give them much time for reflection, and wasted none whatever on conciliation, but affronted them from camel-back, having learned that method, no doubt, from her rightful lord and master. It was obvious from the first that they all knew her by sight.\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ Good meat for the crows ye will all be presently! Has the Lion of Petra lost his teeth that jackals hunt ahead of him? Did the men of Dat Ras profit by coming between him and his prey? Go, look at Rat Das and count the splinters of men's bones! So shall your bones lie--ye who tempt the wrath of Ali Higg!\"\n\nShe rode along the line, showing her little teeth like pomegranate seeds in a sneer that would have made a passport clerk take notice; and her voice was raised to a shrill, harpy scream that rasped under the iron roof, so that none could have pretended he did not hear.\n\n\"The Lion claims this train! The Lion of Petra lies in wait for it at a place of his own choosing! Who dares forestall him? Who dares slay one passenger, or loot one truck? Who dares? Stand out, whoever dares, that I may take his name back to the Lion of Petra!\"\n\nNobody did stand out. They all herded closer together, as if in fear that any one left on the edge of the crowd might be assumed to challenge her authority. Yet they looked capable of plundering a city, that company of stately cutthroats. Perhaps some of them had seen what actually happened when Ali Higg raided Dat Ras. Certainly they came from scattered settlements, on which Ali Higg could take detailed vengeance whenever it suited him.\n\n\"Ye know me! I wait here for the train. I shall ride on it to where the Lion of Petra waits. Who dares interfere with me or follow? Let him name himself! Who dares?\"\n\nHer savagery fed itself on threats, and increased as she felt herself grow mistress of the situation. Partly the primitive love of power, partly the animal instinct to subject and oppress--pride on top of that, and something of her sex, too, glorying in giving orders to the self-styled sterner members--drove her to increasing frenzy.\n\nAnd it was not fear alone that impressed the crowd and impelled it to obedience, for those highland Bedouins are, after all, too practical for that. We were but nine all told, to their seven or eight score, and they might have enforced the logic of that first, and left the threatened consequences for afterward, but for the appeal of the spectacular.\n\nIt bewildered them to be harangued confidently by a woman--they who were used to watching women carry loads. There was something revolutionary about it that took their breath away, and swept their own determination into limbo.\n\nAs always, the men in the background, who felt they could avoid recognition, were the only ones who ventured to raise objection. One or two of them started to laugh, that being the best answer all the world over to any threat, and if the laugh had spread that would likely have been the end of us. I had unslung my rifle and held it in full view resting on my thigh, being minded to look as murderous as possible, but she stole all my thunder by suddenly snatching the rifle away and drawing back its bolt to cock the spring with that almost effortless adroitness that comes of long use.\n\n\"Who laughs at the Lion of Petra's threat?\" she screamed, raising herself in the saddle to survey the crowd. \"Who laughs? He shall die by the hand of a woman! Who laughs, I say?\"\n\nBut nobody wanted to die by a woman's hand; and nobody chose to slay the woman, because of the certainty of vengeance dealt by an expert in terrorism. I know I didn't doubt she would have used the rifle, and I don't suppose they did. If she couldn't be laughed out of countenance the only alternative was bloodshed, and none dared show fight.\n\nOld Ali Baba worked his camel closer, and, because an Arab must boast at every opportunity, began to whisper in my ear.\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ Was I not wise? It was I who told her if she wanted our Jimgrim she should tell the world she is his wife and he the veritable Ali Higg! It takes an old man's tongue to guide the cleverest woman!\"\n\nThe train screamed then in the distance, and a Syrian station agent in tattered khaki uniform went through the wholly unnecessary process of letting down a signal. We got off the track and rode our camels round on to the platform. The crowd gave way before us, and Ayisha thrust herself this and that way among them, breaking up groups, striking me over the wrist with the stick she had for flogging the camel because I tried to regain the rifle.\n\nBy the time the rusty, creaking, groaning rattletrap of a train drew up there was not an element of cohesion left in the crowd. She knew too much to drive them away to where they might have regained something of determination, but let them stand there under her eye where they could see in herself the ruthless symbol of Ali Higg's ruthlessness. And not even the sight of the frightened passengers, in a panic because of tales that had been told them up the line, could restore their plunder-lust.\n\nAs a matter of fact that was a romantic little mixed train when you come to think of it. The Arab engine-driver, piloting his charge through no-man's land, where the bones of former train crews lay bleaching, simply because he was an engine-driver and that was his job; the freight in locked steel cars consigned by optimists who hoped it might reach its destination; the four guards armed with worn-out rifles that they did not dare use; the four passenger-cars with their window-glass all shot away; the half-dozen Arab artisans carried along for makeshift repairs en route; and the more than brave--the too-fatalist-to-care-much passengers wondering which of their number had an enemy at every halting-place; and along with that the formalism--the observance of conventions such as blowing the whistle and pulling down the signal, on a track that carried one train one way once a week; it made you feel like taking off your hat to it all, reminding me in a vague way of those Roman legionaries who kept up the semblance of their civilization after the power of Rome had waned.\n\nI rode over beside the engine-driver and warned him to pull out before trouble started. But he had to take in water first. And he seemed to be an expert in symptoms of lawlessness. Leaning his grimy head and shoulders out of the cab, he looked the crowd over, spat, and showed his yellow teeth in a grin that vaguely reminded me of Grim's good-humored smile.\n\n_\"Mafish!\"_ he remarked, summing up the situation in two syllables. \"Nothing doing!\"",
    "There was any amount more of it, but most of the rest was not polite enough for print, because the Arab likes to enter into details. It sounded much better in Arabic, anyhow. And more and more frequently as the song grew lurid and they warmed to the refrain they made their point by changing the third Akbar into Jimgrim:  _\"Akbar! Akbar! Jimgrim Ali Higg!\"_ It suited their sense of humor finely to announce to the wind and the kites that Grim, the strict, straight, ethical American was a ravisher of virgins and a slitter of offenseless throats, who knew no mercy--a man without law in this world or prospect of peace in the next.\n\nWhen we reached an oasis about noon--sweet water and thirty or forty palm-trees--and simply had to camp there because the camels were exhausted after a night and half a day of strenuous marching, they were still so full of high spirits that they had to work them off somehow; and unwittingly I provided the excuse. I was on the lee side of a camel, opening a boil in Mujrim's leg with his razor, when I caught sight of one of the younger men trying to burgle the medicine-chest. I yelled at him, and naturally gashed my patient's leg, who rose in giant wrath and with enormous fairness smote the real culprit. The resulting blasphemous bad language brought Ali Baba to the scene at once as peacemaker, with all the gang behind him; and in a minute they had all joined hands, with Mahommed standing in the center, and were dancing like a lot of pouter-pigeons, singing a new song about Mujrim's leg, and a razor, and blood on the sand, and palm-trees, and a saint, and my superhuman ability to let daylight into the very heart of boils. You don't have to believe any one who tells you that Arabs haven't humor.\n\nThere were the ruins of half a dozen mud-walled huts near the spring in that oasis. There had once been a sort of rampart and a gate, but there was hardly enough of that left to show where it stood. The only building still quite intact was a stone tomb of about the height of a man, with a plastered cupola roof; and Ali Baba, who always knew everything, swore that was a great saint's grave, and that there was much virtue and good luck to be gained by praying inside the tomb. So they all took turns to go in and pray fervently--two-bow prayers as they called them--reciting thereafter such scripture as Ali Baba thought suitable and could remember. Hunting about in the ruins I found indubitable human bones. Ayisha, when asked about it, said that Ali Higg had raided the place several months ago and killed or captured every one. \"Because he is lord of the waters,\" she explained, and seemed to think that reason unassailable.\n\nThere was quite a dispute at that place as to who should stand first guard while the rest of us slept, but Grim settled it by casting lots with date-stones in a way that was new, but that seemed to satisfy every one--especially as the first watch fell to Narayan Singh and me. \"That is because the rest of us said our prayers,\" explained Ali Baba piously. But I think it was really because Grim knew how to play tricks with the date-stones.\n\nThe Sikh and I kept making the circuit of the palm-trees and talking to keep each other from getting too sleepy, for there is no time when desire to sleep so loads you down as in the noon heat after a long march. You very often can't sleep then because of the very heat that makes you drowsy; but the glare has been so trying to your eyes that you yearn to shut them, and inertia sits on your spine and shoulders like a load of lead. \"Thou and I must watch that woman, sahib,\" said Narayan Singh. \"Our Jimgrim will make use of her; but how shall he do that if her heart changes? As long as she hopes to snare him I am not afraid of her. But what if it should be she who grows afraid as we get nearer to Ali Higg's nest? A woman afraid is worse than a man with a dagger in the dark. Suppose she bolts to Ali Higg and lays information against us--what then?\"\n\nI tried to argue him out of his anxiety, because I wanted to sleep when my turn came. My habit of never looking for trouble is a lovely one until trouble starts; but the Sikh, being only a heathen, could not be persuaded; so I had to promise him that, turn about, four hours on and four off, he and I would watch Ayisha faithfully until such time as Grim should make other disposition of our services or there should be no more need. \"And I think, sahib, that it will be best to shoot or stab her without argument if she turns treacherous.\" But I never stabbed or shot a woman yet. I have a loose-kneed prejudice against it. I said so.\n\n\"Then, sahib, if it be your turn on watch, and you detect treachery, summon me, and I will send her to _Jehannum.\"_\n\n\"I think we ought to speak to Jimgrim about it,\" I objected. \"He might have other plans.\" The Sikh turned that over in his mind during one whole circuit of the palm-trees, stroking his great beard with his right hand the while as if the friction would inspire his brain. \"Jimgrim will say she is a woman and therefore must not be killed in any event,\" he answered at last. \"But that is of the nature of his error, all men suffering delusion in some form, since none is perfect. If we submit the problem to him he will answer wrongly; but we shall then have received orders, which, as faithful men, we must not disobey. As concerns ourselves, being men without specific orders on that point, the question is simple: Of that woman and that man, if the one must live and the other die, which shall it be? And I say Jimgrim shall live, if I die afterward even by his hand for it.\"\n\nIt sounded logical. The arguments with which an unselfish, honest fellow deceives himself into wrong-doing always do bear quite a lot of investigation. But I was at sea before the mast once, where I learned painfully that the captain commands the ship; not even the notions of the buckiest bucko mate amount to as much as a barnacle's bootlace if the old man disagrees from them. \"What makes you think he doesn't understand the obvious danger of Ayisha?\" said I.\n\n\"No man from the West ever understood a woman of the East,\" he answered. That being obviously true--Adam did not understand Eve, and no man from anywhere has understood any woman since--I had to rack my brains for a different argument. \"There are two sure ways of discovering treason,\" I said at last. \"One way is to pick a quarrel with the person you suspect. But the safer way is to seem very friendly. Now--why don't you make love to her? You're a fine, big, handsome man. I don't suppose she'll prefer you in her heart to Jimgrim, but she'll not be ashamed to appear to respond, and if she has evil intentions she will surely seek to take advantage of your passion to forward her own plans. Seeking to make use of you, she will betray herself.\"\n\n\"So speaks the jackal to the tiger. `This way, sahib! That way, sahib! A broad-horned sambhur to be killed, worthy of your honor's strength!' Why don't you make love to her?\"\n\n\"Because I'm afraid,\" said I quite frankly. \"If I thought I could get away with it I'd try. But she'd laugh at me, whereas your attentions might flatter her.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" He stroked his great beard again, and twisted his mustache. \"I'm sure of it.\"\n\n_\"Atcha._ We shall see. I will give the trollop that one chance. It may be she will preserve her head on her shoulders yet by confiding in me; for if I can forewarn Jimgrim of her plans I will reckon it beneath my dignity to use a sword on her. So. It is settled. We shall see.\"\n\nYou know that warm glow of vanity that sweeps over you when another fellow concedes your plan to be better than his? It is rather like the effect of certain drugs--a highly agreeable sensation while it lasts. But it was tempered in my case by that reference he had made to a jackal, and I'm still left wondering how much justice there was in the insinuation. Narayan Singh and I are friends right down to this minute, but I am none the less conscious of a query that seems to spoil confidence a little. He, being master of himself by training, and used to sleeping when he saw fit, volunteered to take the first four-hour watch on Ayisha, so I got as much sleep as the flies and the snores of the rest of the gang would permit, and awoke toward evening to the sound of unaccustomed voices outside my tent. There was one voice with a squeak in it like a rusty wheel that I had certainly never heard before. It seemed we had made some prisoners.",
    "Now the desert at full moon is as light as Broadway, and the only shadows are those the camels cast, than which there is nothing more weird in the whole range of phantasmagoria. We looked like a string of glistening ghosts accompanied by goblins of a fourth dimension mocking us, and though you couldn't see the details of men's faces, looking back along the line you could see every movement and distinguish man from man. About midnight Ayisha made up her mind to enjoy the _shibriyah,_ more, I suspect, for the sake of annoying the Sikh than because she really wanted it. So she ranged alongside, and chiefly because I was curious and chose to be amused, but partly because of my league with Narayan Singh to keep watch on her, I checked my protesting camel and let him drop back into place behind them.\n\nI knew Narayan Singh was awake, for I had seen the glow of his cigarette through the curtains ten minutes before; but he pretended to be asleep, so that she had to get the camels flank to flank and put her hand inside the curtains to awake him. Then he did the obvious thing and seized her hand, and I heard his bass voice answering her shrill protests. I don't know why, but the moonlight that made all things clear seemed also to make words more than usually distinct. \"Ah!\" he boomed. \"I dreamed of paradise. I awake and find a houri with her hand in mine! Il-hamd'ul-illah! I Enter, beloved! Why waste the moonlight hours?\"\n\n\"Pig!\" she retorted. \"Father of bristles! Let my hand go!\"\n\n\"Nay, lovely one! I awake--I see--I understand; thou art not a houri after all, but that same Ayisha I have loved in secret all these burning days! I, who had resolved that gold and honor were as feathers in the scale against thy kisses, am I blessed as last?\"\n\n\"Cursed by black ifrits, thou son of an Afghan pig! Let me go, and get out of that _shibriyah!\"_\n\n\"Such eyes! Behold, the moon is pale beside them, and the stars mere drops of sweat on the sky's dull cheek! Such loveliness as thine, beloved, needs a warrior to worship it--such a man as I, who would cut the throats of kings for a kind word from thee!\"\n\nDon't forget, you fellows who have to call on a girl a dozen Sunday evenings in succession before she will go to the movies or condescend to sit out a dance with you, that east of the fifteenth meridian the situation is reversed, and the man who wasn't swift about his wooing would stand no chance at all. Modesty of approach is reckoned a sure sign of unworthiness, and deference as cowardice that fears to seize an opportunity.\n\n\"An Indian lover and a boasting louse are one,\" she answered; but she laughed as she said it, and her voice had lost the shrill note.\n\n\"Hah! Try me!\" he retorted, tugging at her hand again, and whether or not she tried really hard to release it she failed. \"Boasts should be put to the test, beloved! We of the North have a way of understanding our performance. I would burn and lay waste cities for thy sake! Come!\"\n\nHer laugh struck a bell-like note now. There was a hint of pleasure in it, and more than a hint of thoughtfulness. You know those overtones of a bell that go fading away into the infinite, in touch, somehow, with thoughts that haven't reached any of us yet except the man who made the bell.\n\n\"Ah! Afghans are all alike!\" Sikhs say that of Afghans too, and Afghans say the same thing of the Sikhs. \"You would say anything for me; but as for cutting throats and laying waste, I myself would be the very first victim. Thy love, I think, would burn up and be ashes faster than the cities I should never see.\"\n\n\"Cities! I will take you to all the cities! You shall have your will of the richest! Covet pearls, and I will burn the feet of jewelers until they beg you to take their costliest! Covet rubies, and I will plunder them from the eyes of temple gods! Covet gold, and I will melt down the throne of a maharajah to make bracelets for your ankles!\"\n\n_\"Wallahi!_ You speak like a braggart.\"\n\n\"Braggart? I? Nay, I am a lover whose words go lamely. They are but chaff blown along the wind of great accomplishment. With thee to fight for I would dare the very rage of Ali Higg!\" He still held her hand. She waited about a minute before answering.\n\n\"Which Ali Higg?\" she asked at last.\n\n\"Any Ali Higg! All Ali Higgs! As lions go down beneath the feet of elephants so shall the Lion of Petra fail before me!\"\n\n\"One at a time!\" she laughed. \"There is one Ali Higg who could command you with a word--another who could order your carcass thrown to the vultures. Words first, since your boastings are all words! I say that, for all your brave words, this Ali Higg who rides ahead of us can make you slay me for a word of praise from him.\"\n\n\"You mean, beloved, you could make me slay him for a word of praise from you!\" the Sikh lied glibly.\n\n\"But I might not want him slain.\"\n\n\"Have him made into a cripple, then--a ruin of a man, for daring to displease you!\"\n\n\"But he pleases me!\"\n\n\"Aha! I am jealous! By the beard of the Prophet, Ayisha, beware of my jealousy! I am a man of few words but sudden deeds! Is there a man who stands in my way? May Allah show compassion on him, for he is like to need it!\"\n\nHe was so fervid in his avowals that he almost convinced me--almost made me believe that his private agreement with me had been a camouflage for his real intentions. There is precious little of which my friend Narayan Singh isn't capable in the way of romantic soldiering; he ought to have been born two or three hundred years ago as, in fact, according to his reincarnating creed, he was. Perhaps he remembers past lives so vividly that he lives them over again. I wish I could remember a past life or two. Ayisha was about to answer him when Grim's shrill bosun's whistle that he keeps for emergencies whined from in front, and the sleepy-looking line awoke with a start.",
    "Of course, no committee in the world ever yet did more than cloud an issue with argument. It takes one man to lead the way through any set of circumstances, and the only wise course for a committee is to make that man's decision unanimous and back it loyally. But men have their rights, as Grim is always the first to admit. Ali Baba came and joined us on the cliff-top, and Narayan Singh was not long following suit. The Sikh said nothing, but Ali Baba was conscious of the weight that years should give to his opinion, as well as justly proud of his night's work, and not at all disposed to sit in silence. \"Now the right course, Jimgrim, is to make a great circuit and carry these two women back across the British border,\" he began at once. \"The Lion of Petra will then pay us all large sums of money, without which you will refuse to intercede with the government on his behalf for their return. Thus every one will be satisfied except the Lion, who will be too poor for a long time afterward to have much authority in these parts. Moreover, it will be told for a joke against him, and he will lose in prestige. I am an old man, who knows all about these matters.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Narayan Singh?\" Grim asked.\n\n\"Sahib, what are we but a flying column? Swiftness and surprise are our two advantages. We should be like a javelin thrown from ambush that seeks out the enemy's heart. If we fail we are but a lost javelin--an officer, a sepoy, a civilian and a handful of thieves--there are plenty more! If we succeed there is a deed done well and cheaply! I never hunted lions, but I have seen a tiger trapped and beaten. Have we not good bait with us?\"\n\nThere followed a hot argument between Arab and Sikh, each accusing the other of ulterior motives as well as ignorance and cowardice; in fact, they acted like any other committee, growing less and less parliamentary as their views diverged. Ali Baba seemed to consider it relevant to call Narayan Singh a drunkard, and the Sikh considered it his duty in the circumstances to refer to Ali Baba's jail record. In the midst of all that effort to solve the problem at Petra, Grim asked me to go and invite Jael Higg to join us.\n\nIn that hard, uncharitable desert daylight she did not impress me very favorably. The lines of her freckled face suggested too much ruthlessness, as though she was positively handsome in a certain way--as long as you observed the whole effect and did not study details--there was a look of cold experience about her brown eyes that chilled you. Of course, she was tired and that made a difference; but I did not find it easy to feel sympathetic, and I thought she was hardly the woman to win a jury's verdict on the strength of personal appeal.\n\nNevertheless, with all the odds against her, she accomplished that morning what I had never done, or seen done, although many have attempted it and failed. She contrived to tear away Grim's mask and to expose the man's real feelings. He was always an enigma to me until that interview, at which they squatted facing each other on Grim's mat, with me beside Grim and the Sikh and Ali Baba glaring daggers at each other on either hand. The early sun seemed to edge everybody with a sort of aura, but it also showed every detail of a face and made it next to impossible to hide emotion.\n\nShe opened the ball. I imagine she had been doing that most of her life.\n\n\"Jimgrim,\" she said. \"Jimgrim. Are you by any chance the American named James Grim, who fought with Lawrence in Allenby's campaign?\" Grim astonished us all by admitting it at once. The name Jimgrim sounds enough like Arabic to pass muster; and we wondered why he should have gone to all that trouble to disguise himself, only to confess his real name when there seemed no need. Even Ali Baba left off cursing the Sikh under his breath.\n\n\"I am glad to know that,\" she said. \"It will save my wasting words. No man could ever get your reputation without being ruthless. I won't annoy you by pleading for mercy.\" And she looked at once as merciless as she expected him to be.\n\n\"Now, Jael Higg,\" he answered, \"let's talk sense.\"\n\n\"You're a rare one, if you can!\" she retorted.\n\n\"Let's do our best,\" he said kindly. She looked very keenly at him for thirty seconds, and seemed to make up her mind that she had no chance against him.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said. \"I'll begin by being sensible. How much money do you want?\" It is true that the more you analyze Grim's face the more he does impress you as a keen business man. But there are modifying symptoms. He did not appear to have heard the question.\n\n\"I want you to be straightforward and tell me all you know of Ali Higg's circumstances.\"\n\n\"Yes. I'd expect you to want that. As an American hired by the British to help them exploit this country, that's what you would ask. After you know all about him you can fix the ransom. That right? Well, I won't tell.\"\n\n\"I hoped we were going to talk sense,\" he answered quietly.\n\n\"How can any one talk sense with a man like you? What are you doing in this country? `Horning in' is what they'd call it in America. You've got no business here. It's different in my case. I'm married to Ali Higg. I've thrown in my lot with these people. I've a right to help them to independence. But what right have you got to interfere? Bah! Name your price. I'll pay if I can.\"\n\n\"Well, Jael,\" he answered with a rather whimsical smile. \"I'll try to disillusion you to begin with. Perhaps if you understand me better you'll be reasonable. All I know is Arabic and Arabs. I've no other gifts, and I like to be some use in the world. I'm real fond of Arabs. It 'ud tickle me to see them make good. But I can see as far through a stone wall as any blind horse can, and I know--better maybe than you do, Jael--that all they'll get by cutting loose and playing pirates is the worst end of it. I hate to see them lose out, so I use what gifts I've got in their behalf.\"",
    "\"You told me,\" she said at last, \"that you have poison in that box that would reach down to hell and slay the ifrits. Give me some of it.\"\n\n_\"Ya sit Ayisha._ I need it all for the ifrits,\" I answered.\n\n\"I will make no trouble for you,\" she said; and for a moment I suspected she meant to kill herself.\n\n\"You are young and beautiful,\" I told her. \"The world holds plenty of good for you yet.\"\n\nAt that she flashed her white teeth and her eyes blazed.\n\n\"Truly! Allah puts a good omen into your mouth, _miyan!_ Yet little comes to the woman who neglects to plan for it. Give me the poison. I will pay.\"\n\nI was about to refuse abruptly, being rather old-maidish about some things and not always ready with a smile for what I don't approve; but Narayan Singh interrupted in time to prevent the unforgivable offense of preaching my own code of morals uninvited.\n\n\"Tell us who is to be poisoned,\" he demanded.\n\n\"That is none of your business,\" she answered calmly.\n\n\"But the poison is our business,\" said the Sikh. \"We make terms. If the person to be poisoned is an enemy of ours, well and good; you shall have it and we shall be gainers. But Allah forbid that we should hasten the death of a friend! Is it for Jael Higg?\"\n\n\"No, for I see that to poison her would be to incur the enmity of Jimgrim. Already he takes counsel with her; did he and she not lay their heads together in your presence after morning prayers?\"\n\n\"For whom, then? For Jimgrim?\"\n\n\"God forbid! Shall I woo a dead man? Nay! You say you will give me the poison if I tell? You swear it? Then it is for the Lion of Petra. Thus I shall win the love of Jimgrim. And Jael, being without a man, will run away to Egypt, where her money is.\"\n\n_\"Bismillah!\"_ swore the Sikh. \"I see no reason why I should not get an angry husband out of the way so simply! But remember, Ayisha, you must slay me in turn if you hope to have Jimgrim for husband. By my beard and the Prophet's feet it is I who will have you to wife, if I have to burn kingdoms first!\"\n\n\"Give me the poison first, and we shall see,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Very well; leave us for a while, Ayisha. I will persuade this master of mine, who has a vein of caution, since he lacks the zeal of love. I will bring you the stuff when he and I have talked it over.\"\n\n\"Strong, strong stuff,\" she insisted. \"Stuff that would eat iron. Ali Higg's belly is tough.\"\n\n\"It shall come out through his flesh like flame,\" the Sikh promised.\n\nAs soon as she had gone, and he had watched her out of earshot, he turned to me with a gruff laugh.\n\n\"Now, sahib, make her up a potion of some harmless powder for me to carry to her tent while you go and tell our Jimgrim what has passed. Give her physic that will purge the Lion of Petra without doing worse than make his belly burn. Stay; give croton in a bottle; that is best.\"",
    "Grim called a halt at last where a dozen caves a hundred feet above the bottom of the gorge could be reached by a goat-track leading to a ledge. There was a rift in the side-wall there, making a pitch-dark corner where the camels could lie unseen and grumble to one another--safe enough until daylight, unless they should see ghosts and try to stampede for the open. Grim sent the women and Ayisha's four men up to the caves with only Narayan Singh to watch them, for there was no way of escape, except by that twelve-inch goat-track.\n\nThen, because Ali Baba's sons and grandsons were nervous about the \"old man their father,\" and because the one thing that more than all other circumstances combined could ruin our slim chance would be panic, Grim squatted on the sand in the gorge with the men all around him and began to tell stories.\n\nRight there in the very jaws of death, within a mile of the lair of Ali Higg, in possession of two of the tyrant's wives, with an army at our rear that might at that minute be following old Ali Baba into the gorge to cut off our one possible retreat, he told them the old tales that Arabs love, and soothed them as if they were children.\n\nThat was the finest glimpse of Grim's real manhood I had experienced yet, although I could not see him for the darkness. You couldn't see any one. It was a voice in the night--strong, reassuring--telling to born thieves stories of the warm humanity of other thieves, whose accomplishments in the way of cool cheek and lawless altruism were hardly more outrageous than the task in front of us.\n\nAnd he told them so well that even when a chill draft crept along the bottom of the gorge two hours before dawn, taking the place of the hot air that had ascended, and you could feel the shiver that shook the circle of listeners, they only drew closer and leaned forward more intently--almost as if he were a fire at which they warmed themselves.\n\nBut heavens! It seemed madness, nevertheless. We had no more pickets out than the enemy had. We were relying utterly on Grim's information that he had extracted from the women and the prisoners, and on his judgment based on that.\n\nNo doubt he knew a lot that he had not told us, for that is his infernal way of doing business; but neither that probability, nor his tales that so suited the Arab mind, nor the recollection of earlier predicaments in which his flair for solutions had been infallibly right, soothed my nerves much; and I nearly jumped out of my skin when a series of grunts and stumbling footfalls broke the stillness of the gorge behind us.\n\nIt sounded like ten weary camels being cursed by ten angry men, and I supposed at once that Ibrahim ben Ah had sent a detachment to investigate and that this was their advance-guard. Who else would dare to lift his voice in that way in the gorge? You could hear the words presently:\n\n\"Ill-bred Somali beast! Born among vermin in a black man's kraal! Allah give thee to the crows! Weary? What of it? What of my back, thou awkward earthquake! Thou plow-beast! A devil sit on thee! A devil drive thee! A devil eat thee!\"\n\n_Whack! Whack!_\n\n\"Oh my bones! My old bones!\"\n\nMujrim was the first to recognize the voice. He got up quietly and stood in the gorge; and in another minute a blot of denser blackness that was a camel loomed above him, and he raised his hand to seize the head-rope. But the camel saw him first, and, realizing that the journey was over at last, flung itself to the ground with the abandon of a foundered dog, and lay with its neck stretched out straight and legs all straddled anyhow. Mujrim was just in time to catch his father, who was nearly as tired as the camel. It was pretty obvious at once that Jael's authority had failed badly when it came to exchanging camels.\n\nThe sons all surrounded the old man and made a fuss over him, laying him down on a sheepskin coat and chafing his stiff muscles, calling him brave names, rubbing his feet, patting his hands, praising him, while he swore at them each time they touched a sore spot.\n\nThey would not even give him a chance to hand over his letter to Grim, until at last he swore so savagely that Mujrim paid attention and took the letter out of the old man's waistcloth. It was in the same envelop in which the other had gone, unsealed, but with the thumb-mark of Ibrahim ben Ah imprinted on its face.",
    "You can expect anything, of course, of Arabs. People who will pitch black cotton tents in the scorching sun, and live in them in preference to gorgeous cool stone temples because of the devils and ghosts that they believe to haunt those habitable splendors, will believe anything at all except the truth, and act in any way except reasonably. So I tried to believe it was all right to be unreasonable too.\n\nYou would think, wouldn't you, that a man who had set himself up to be the holy terror of a country-side and put his heel on the necks of all the tribes for miles around, would have made use at least of the caves and tombs to strengthen his position. There were thousands of them all among those opal-colored cliffs, to say nothing of ruined buildings; yet not one was occupied. Ayisha had told most of the truth when she said in El-Kalil that her people lived in tents.\n\nWe walked down the paved street of a city between oleander bushes that had forced themselves up between the cracks, toward an enormous open amphitheater hewn by the Romans out of a hillside, with countless tiers of ruined stone seats rising one above the other like giant steps.\n\nIn the center of that the tents were pitched, and the only building in use was a great half-open cave on another hillside, in which Ayisha told us Ali Higg himself lived, overlooking the entire camp and directing its destinies.\n\nOn the top of the mountain in front of us was the tomb of Aaron, Moses' brother. On another mountain farther off stood a great crusader castle all in ruins; and to left and right were endless remains of civilization that throve when the British were living in mud-and-wattle huts. The dry climate had preserved it all; but there was water enough; it only needed the labor of a thousand men to remake a city of it.\n\nWe avoided the amphitheater with its hundreds of tents pitched inside and all about it, because Ayisha said the women would come running out to greet her, and she did not desire that any more than we did. So we turned to the right, and started up a flight of steps nearly a mile long that led to an ancient place of sacrifice; two hundred yards up that the track turned off that led to Ali Higg's cavern.\n\nIt was there, where the broken steps and sidetrack met, that the first men came hurrying to meet us and blocked our way--four of them, active as goats, and looking fierce enough to scare away twice their number. But they recognized Ayisha, and stood aside at once to let us pass, showing her considerable gruff respect and asking a string of questions, which she countered with platitudes. They did not follow us, but stayed on guard at the corner, as if the meeting between Ali Higg and his wife were something to keep from prying eyes.\n\nSo the far-famed Ali Higg was alone in his great cave when we reached it, sitting near the entrance propped on skins and cushions with a perfect armory of weapons on the floor beside him. The interior was hung with fine Bokhara embroideries, and every inch of the floor was covered with rugs.\n\nThere was another cave opening into that in which he sat; and it, too, was richly decorated; but the sound of women's voices that we heard came from a third cave around the corner of the cliff wall, not connected. Ali Higg was apparently in no mood for female company--or any other kind.\n\nIn the shadow of the overhanging rock he looked so like Grim it was laughable. He was a caricature of our man, with all the refinement and humor subtly changed into irritable anger. He looked as if he would scream if you touched him, and no wonder; for the back of the poor fellow's neck, half hidden by the folds of his head-cloth, was a perfect mess of boils that made every movement of his head an agony.\n\nHis eyes were darker than Grim's, and blazed as surely no white man's ever did; and his likeness to Grim was lessened by the fact that he had not been shaved for a day or two, and the sparse black hair coarsened the outline of his chin and jaw. In spite of his illness he had not laid aside the bandolier that crossed his breast, nor the two daggers tucked into his waist-cloth. And he laid his hand on a modern British Army rifle the minute he caught sight of us."

  "H. Rider Haggard -- The Ivory Child": [
    "Now I, Allan Quatermain, come to the story of what was, perhaps, one of the strangest of all the adventures which have befallen me in the course of a life that so far can scarcely be called tame or humdrum. Amongst many other things it tells of the war against the Black Kendah people and the death of Jana, their elephant god. Often since then I have wondered if this creature was or was not anything more than a mere gigantic beast of the forest. It seems improbable, even impossible, but the reader of future days may judge of this matter for himself. Also he can form his opinion as to the religion of the White Kendah and their pretensions to a certain degree of magical skill. Of this magic I will make only one remark: If it existed at all, it was by no means infallible. To take a single instance, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt were convinced by divination that I, and I only, could kill Jana, which was why they invited me to Kendahland. Yet in the end it was Hans who killed him. Jana nearly killed me!\n\nNow to my tale.\n\nIn another history, called \u201cThe Holy Flower,\u201d I have told how I came to England with a young gentleman of the name of Scroope, partly to see him safely home after a hunting accident, and partly to try to dispose of a unique orchid for a friend of mine called Brother John by the white people, and Dogeetah by the natives, who was popularly supposed to be mad, but, in fact, was very sane indeed. So sane was he that he pursued what seemed to be an absolutely desperate quest for over twenty years, until, with some humble assistance on my part, he brought it to a curiously successful issue. But all this tale is told in \u201cThe Holy Flower,\u201d and I only allude to it here, that is at present, to explain how I came to be in England.\n\nWhile in this country I stayed for a few days with Scroope, or, rather, with his fianc\u00e9e and her people, at a fine house in Essex. (I called it Essex to avoid the place being identified, but really it was one of the neighbouring counties.) During my visit I was taken to see a much finer place, a splendid old castle with brick gateway towers, that had been wonderfully well restored and turned into a most luxurious modern dwelling. Let us call it \u201cRagnall,\u201d the seat of a baron of that name.\n\nI had heard a good deal about Lord Ragnall, who, according to all accounts, seemed a kind of Admirable Crichton. He was said to be wonderfully handsome, a great scholar\u2014he had taken a double first at college; a great athlete\u2014he had been captain of the Oxford boat at the University race; a very promising speaker who had already made his mark in the House of Lords; a sportsman who had shot tigers and other large game in India; a poet who had published a successful volume of verse under a pseudonym; a good solider until he left the Service; and lastly, a man of enormous wealth, owning, in addition to his estates, several coal mines and an entire town in the north of England.\n\n\u201cDear me!\u201d I said when the list was finished, \u201che seems to have been born with a whole case of gold spoons in his mouth. I hope one of them will not choke him,\u201d adding: \u201cPerhaps he will be unlucky in love.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just where he is most lucky of all,\u201d answered the young lady to whom I was talking\u2014it was Scroope\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Miss Manners\u2014\u201cfor he is engaged to a lady that, I am told, is the loveliest, sweetest, cleverest girl in all England, and they absolutely adore each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me!\u201d I repeated. \u201cI wonder what Fate _has_ got up its sleeve for Lord Ragnall and his perfect lady-love?\u201d\n\nI was doomed to find out one day.\n\nSo it came about that when, on the following morning, I was asked if I would like to see the wonders of Ragnall Castle, I answered \u201cYes.\u201d Really, however, I wanted to have a look at Lord Ragnall himself, if possible, for the account of his many perfections had impressed the imagination of a poor colonist like myself, who had never found an opportunity of setting his eyes upon a kind of human angel. Human devils I had met in plenty, but never a single angel\u2014at least, of the male sex. Also there was always the possibility that I might get a glimpse of the still more angelic lady to whom he was engaged, whose name, I understood, was the Hon. Miss Holmes. So I said that nothing would please me more than to see this castle.\n\nThither we drove accordingly through the fine, frosty air, for the month was December. On reaching the castle, Mr. Scroope was told that Lord Ragnall, whom he knew well, was out shooting somewhere in the park, but that, of course, he could show his friend over the place. So we went in, the three of us, for Miss Manners, to whom Scroope was to be married very shortly, had driven us over in her pony carriage. The porter at the gateway towers took us to the main door of the castle and handed us over to another man, whom he addressed as Mr. Savage, whispering to me that he was his lordship\u2019s personal attendant.\n\n\nI remember the name, because it seemed to me that I had never seen anyone who looked much less savage. In truth, his appearance was that of a duke in disguise, as I imagine dukes to be, for I never set eyes on one. His dress\u2014he wore a black morning cut-away coat\u2014was faultless. His manners were exquisite, polite to the verge of irony, but with a hint of haughty pride in the background. He was handsome also, with a fine nose and a hawk-like eye, while a touch of baldness added to the general effect. His age may have been anything between thirty-five and forty, and the way he deprived me of my hat and stick, to which I strove to cling, showed, I thought, resolution of character. Probably, I reflected to myself, he considers me an unusual sort of person who might damage the pictures and other objects of art with the stick, and not seeing his way how to ask me to give it up without suggesting suspicion, has hit upon the expedient of taking my hat also.\n\n\nIn after days Mr. Samuel Savage informed me that I was quite right in this surmise. He said he thought that, judging from my somewhat unconventional appearance, I might be one of the dangerous class of whom he had been reading in the papers, namely, a \u201chanarchist.\u201d I write the word as he pronounced it, for here comes the curious thing. This man, so flawless, so well instructed in some respects, had a fault which gave everything away. His h\u2019s were uncertain. Three of them would come quite right, but the fourth, let us say, would be conspicuous either by its utter absence or by its unwanted appearance. He could speak, when describing the Ragnall pictures, in rotund and flowing periods that would scarcely have disgraced the pen of Gibbon. Then suddenly that \u201ch\u201d would appear or disappear, and the illusion was over. It was like a sudden shock of cold water down the back. I never discovered the origin of his family; it was a matter of which he did not speak, perhaps because he was vague about it himself; but if an earl of Norman blood had married a handsome Cockney kitchenmaid of native ability, I can quite imagine that Samuel Savage might have been a child of the union. For the rest he was a good man and a faithful one, for whom I have a high respect.\n\n\nOn this occasion he conducted us round the castle, or, rather, its more public rooms, showing us many treasures and, I should think, at least two hundred pictures by eminent and departed artists, which gave him an opportunity of exhibiting a peculiar, if somewhat erratic, knowledge of history. To tell the truth, I began to wish that it were a little less full in detail, since on a December day those large apartments felt uncommonly cold. Scroope and Miss Manners seemed to keep warm, perhaps with the inward fires of mutual admiration, but as I had no one to admire except Mr. Savage, a temperature of about 35 degrees produced its natural effect upon me.\n\n\nAt length we took a short cut from the large to the little gallery through a warmed and comfortable room, which I understood was Lord Ragnall\u2019s study. Halting for a moment by one of the fires, I observed a picture on the wall, over which a curtain was drawn, and asked Mr. Savage what it might be.\n\n\u201cThat, sir,\u201d he replied with a kind of haughty reserve, \u201cis the portrait of her future ladyship, which his lordship keeps for his private heye.\u201d\n\nMiss Manners sniggered, and I said:\n\n\u201cOh, thank you. What an ill-omened kind of thing to do!\u201d\n\nThen, observing through an open door the hall in which my hat had been taken from me, I lingered and as the others vanished in the little gallery, slipped into it, recovered my belongings, and passed out to the garden, purposing to walk there till I was warm again and Scroope reappeared. While I marched up and down a terrace, on which, I remember, several very cold-looking peacocks were seated, like conscientious birds that knew it was their duty to be ornamental, however low the temperature, I heard some shots fired, apparently in a clump of ilex oaks which grew about five hundred yards away, and reflected to myself that they seemed to be those of a small rifle, not of a shotgun.\n\n\nMy curiosity being excited as to what was to be an almost professional matter, I walked towards the grove, making a circuit through a shrubbery. At length I found myself near to the edge of a glade, and perceived, standing behind the shelter of a magnificent ilex, two men. One of these was a young keeper, and the other, from his appearance, I felt sure must be Lord Ragnall himself.",
    "Dinner was announced. Presently we were wending in the centre of a long and glittering procession across the central hall to the banqueting chamber, a splendid room with a roof like a church that was said to have been built in the times of the Plantagenets. Here Mr. Savage, who evidently had been looking out for her future ladyship, conducted us to our places, which were upon the left of Lord Ragnall, who sat at the head of the broad table with Lady Longden on his right. Then the old clergyman, Dr. Jeffreys, a pompous and rather frowsy ecclesiastic, said grace, for grace was still in fashion at such feasts in those days, asking Heaven to make us truly thankful for the dinner we were about to consume.\n\nCertainly there was a great deal to be thankful for in the eating and drinking line, but of all I remember little, except a general vision of silver dishes, champagne, splendour, and things I did not want to eat being constantly handed to me. What I do remember is Miss Holmes, and nothing but Miss Holmes; the charm of her conversation, the light of her beautiful eyes, the fragrance of her hair, her most flattering interest in my unworthy self. To tell the truth, we got on \u201clike fire in the winter grass,\u201d as the Zulus say, and when that dinner was over the grass was still burning.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think that Lord Ragnall quite liked it, but fortunately Lady Longden was a talkative person. First she conversed about her cold in the head, sneezing at intervals, poor soul, and being reduced to send for another handkerchief after the entr\u00e9es. Then she got off upon business matters; to judge from the look of boredom on her host\u2019s face, I think it must have been of settlements. Three times did I hear him refer her to the lawyers\u2014without avail. Lastly, when he thought he had escaped, she embarked upon a quite vigorous argument with Dr. Jeffreys about church matters\u2014I gathered that she was \u201clow\u201d and he was \u201chigh\u201d\u2014in which she insisted upon his lordship acting as referee.\n\n\u201cDo try and keep your attention fixed, George,\u201d I heard her say severely. \u201cTo allow it to wander when high spiritual affairs are under discussion (sneeze) is scarcely reverent. Could you tell the man to shut that door? The draught is dreadful. It is quite impossible for you to agree with both of us, as you say you do, seeing that metaphorically Dr. Jeffreys is at one pole and I am at the other.\u201d (Sneeze.)\n\n\u201cThen I wish I were at the Tropic of Cancer,\u201d I heard him mutter with a groan.\n\n\nIn vain; he had to keep his \u201cattention fixed\u201d on this point for the next three-quarters of an hour. So as Miss Manners was at the other side of me, and Scroope, unhampered by the presence of any prospective mother-in-law, was at the other side of her, for all practical purposes Miss Holmes and I were left alone.\n\n\nShe began by saying:\n\n\u201cI hear you beat Sir Junius Fortescue out shooting to-day, and won a lot of money from him which you gave to the Cottage Hospital. I don\u2019t like shooting, and I don\u2019t like betting; and it\u2019s strange, because you don\u2019t look like a man who bets. But I detest Sir Junius Fortescue, and that is a bond of union between us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said I detested him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but I am sure you do. Your face changed when I mentioned his name.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs it happens, you are right. But, Miss Holmes, I should like you to understand that you were also right when you said I did not look like a betting man.\u201d And I told her some of the story of Van Koop and the \u00a3250.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d she said, when I had finished, \u201cI always felt sure he was a horror. And my mother wanted me, just because he pretended to be low church\u2014but that\u2019s a secret.\u201d\n\n\nThen I congratulated her upon her approaching marriage, saying what a joyful thing it was now and again to see everything going in real, happy, storybook fashion: beauty, male and female, united by love, high rank, wealth, troops of friends, health of body, a lovely and an ancient home in a settled land where dangers do not come\u2014at present\u2014respect and affection of crowds of dependents, the prospect of a high and useful career of a sort whereof the door is shut to most people, everything in short that human beings who are not actually royalty could desire or deserve. Indeed after my second glass of champagne I grew quite eloquent on these and kindred points, being moved thereto by memories of the misery that is in the world which formed so great a contrast to the lot of this striking and brilliant pair.\n\n\nShe listened to me attentively and answered:\n\n\u201cThank you for your kind thoughts and wishes. But does it not strike you, Mr. Quatermain, that there is something ill-omened in such talk? I believe that it does; that as you finished speaking it occurred to you that after all the future is as much veiled from all of us as\u2014as the picture which hangs behind its curtain of rose-coloured silk in Lord Ragnall\u2019s study is from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d I asked sharply in a low voice. For by the strangest of coincidences, as I concluded my somewhat old-fashioned little speech of compliments, this very reflection had entered my mind, and with it the memory of the veiled picture which Mr. Savage had pointed out to me on the previous morning.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say, Mr. Quatermain, but I did know it. You were thinking of the picture, were you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I was,\u201d I said, avoiding a direct reply, \u201cwhat of it? Though it is hidden from everybody else, he has only to draw the curtain and see\u2014you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupposing he should draw the curtain one day and see nothing, Mr. Quatermain?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the picture would have been stolen, that is all, and he would have to search for it till he found it again, which doubtless sooner or later he would do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sooner or later. But where? Perhaps you have lost a picture or two in your time, Mr. Quatermain, and are better able to answer the question than I am.\u201d\n\n\nThere was silence for a few moments, for this talk of lost pictures brought back memories which choked me.\n\n\nThen she began to speak again, low, quickly, and with suppressed passion, but acting wonderfully all the while. Knowing that eyes were on her, her gestures and the expression of her face were such as might have been those of any young lady of fashion who was talking of everyday affairs, such as dancing, or flowers, or jewels. She smiled and even laughed occasionally. She played with the golden salt-cellar in front of her and, upsetting a little of the salt, threw it over her left shoulder, appearing to ask me if I were a victim of that ancient habit, and so on.\n\n\nBut all the while she was talking deeply of deep things, such as I should never have thought would pass her mind. This was the substance of what she said, for I cannot set it all down verbatim; after so many years my memory fails me.\n\n\u201cI am not like other women. Something moves me to tell you so, something very real and powerful which pushes me as a strong man might. It is odd, because I have never spoken to anyone else like that, not to my mother for instance, or even to Lord Ragnall. They would neither of them understand, although they would misunderstand differently. My mother would think I ought to see a doctor\u2014and if you knew that doctor! He,\u201d and she nodded towards Lord Ragnall, \u201cwould think that my engagement had upset me, or that I had grown rather more religious than I ought to be at my age, and been reflecting too much\u2014well, on the end of all things. From a child I have understood that I am a mystery set in the midst of many other mysteries. It all came to me one night when I was about nine years old. I seemed to see the past and the future, although I could grasp neither. Such a long, long past and such an infinite future. I don\u2019t know what I saw, and still see sometimes. It comes in a flash, and is in a flash forgotten. My mind cannot hold it. It is too big for my mind; you might as well try to pack Dr. Jeffreys there into this wineglass. Only two facts remain written on my heart. The first is that there is trouble ahead of me, curious and unusual trouble; and the second, that permanently, continually, I, or a part of me, have something to do with Africa, a country of which I know nothing except from a few very dull books. Also, by the way\u2014this is a new thought\u2014that I have a great deal to do with _you_. That is why I am so interested in Africa and you. Tell me about Africa and yourself now, while we have the chance.\u201d And she ended rather abruptly, adding in a louder voice, \u201cYou have lived there all your life, have you not, Mr. Quatermain?\u201d",
    "After Lord Ragnall had seen his guests to the door in the old-fashioned manner, he returned and asked me if I played cards, or whether I preferred music. I was assuring him that I hated the sight of a card when Mr. Savage appeared in his silent way and respectfully inquired of his lordship whether any gentleman was staying in the house whose Christian name was _Here-come-a-zany_. Lord Ragnall looked at him with a searching eye as though he suspected him of being drunk, and then asked what he meant by such a ridiculous question.\n\n\u201cI mean, my lord,\u201d replied Mr. Savage with a touch of offence in his tone, \u201cthat two foreign individuals in white clothes have arrived at the castle, stating that they wish to speak at once with a _Mr. Here-come-a-zany_ who is staying here. I told them to go away as the butler said he could make nothing of their talk, but they only sat down in the snow and said they would wait for _Here-come-a-zany_.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you had better put them in the old guardroom, lock them up with something to eat, and send the stable-boy for the policeman, who is a zany if ever anybody was. I expect they are after the pheasants.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop a bit,\u201d I said, for an idea had occurred to me. \u201cThe message may be meant for me, though I can\u2019t conceive who sent it. My native name is Macumazana, which possibly Mr. Savage has not caught quite correctly. Shall I go to see these men?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that in this cold, Quatermain,\u201d Lord Ragnall answered. \u201cDid they say what they are, Savage?\u201d\n\n\u201cI made out that they were conjurers, my lord. At least when I told them to go away one of them said, \u2018You will go first, gentleman.\u2019 Then, my lord, I heard a hissing sound in my coat-tail pocket and, putting my hand into it, I found a large snake which dropped on the ground and vanished. It quite paralysed me, my lord, and while I stood there wondering whether I was bitten, a mouse jumped out of the kitchenmaid\u2019s hair. She had been laughing at their dress, my lord, but _now_ she\u2019s screaming in hysterics.\u201d\n\n\nThe solemn aspect of Mr. Savage as he narrated these unholy marvels was such that, like the kitchenmaid, we both burst into ill-timed merriment. Attracted by our laughter, Miss Holmes, Miss Manners, with whom she was talking, and some of the other guests, approached and asked what was the matter.\n\n\u201cSavage here declares that there are two conjurers in the kitchen premises, who have been producing snakes out of his pocket and mice from the hair of one of the maids, and who want to see Mr. Quatermain,\u201d Lord Ragnall answered.\n\n\u201cConjurers! Oh, do have them in, George,\u201d exclaimed Miss Holmes; while Miss Manners and the others, who were getting a little tired of promiscuous conversation, echoed her request.\n\n\u201cBy all means,\u201d he answered, \u201cthough we have enough mice here without their bringing any more. Savage, go and tell your two friends that _Mr. Here-come-a-zany_ is waiting for them in the drawing-room, and that the company would like to see some of their tricks.\u201d\n\n\nSavage bowed and departed, like a hero to execution, for by his pallor I could see that he was in a great fright. When he had gone we set to work and cleared a space in the middle of the room, in front of which we arranged chairs for the company to sit on.\n\n\u201cNo doubt they are Indian jugglers,\u201d said Lord Ragnall, \u201cand will want a place to grow their mango-tree, as I remember seeing them do in Kashmir.\u201d\n\n\nAs he spoke the door opened and Mr. Savage appeared through it, walking much faster than was his wont. I noted also that he gripped the pockets of his swallow-tail coat firmly in his hand.\n\n\u201cMr. Hare-root and Mr. Mare-root,\u201d he announced.\n\n\u201cHare-root and Mare-root!\u201d repeated Lord Ragnall.\n\n\u201cHar\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, I expect,\u201d I said. \u201cI think I have read somewhere that they were great magicians, whose names these conjurers have taken.\u201d (Since then I have discovered that they are mentioned in the Koran as masters of the Black Art.)\n\n\nA moment later two men followed him through the doorway. The first was a tall, Eastern-looking person with a grave countenance, a long, white beard, a hooked nose, and flashing, hawk-like eyes. The second was shorter and rather stout, also much younger. He had a genial, smiling face, small, beady-black eyes, and was clean-shaven. They were very light in colour; indeed I have seen Italians who are much darker; and there was about their whole aspect a certain air of power.\n\n\nInstantly I remembered the story that Miss Holmes had told me at dinner and looked at her covertly, to see that she had turned quite pale and was trembling a little. I do not think that anyone else noticed this, however, as all were staring at the strangers. Moreover she recovered herself in a moment, and, catching my eye, laid her finger on her lips in token of silence.\n\n\nThe men were clothed in thick, fur-lined cloaks, which they took off and, folding them neatly, laid upon the floor, standing revealed in robes of a beautiful whiteness and in large plain turbans, also white.\n\n\u201cHigh-class Somali Arabs,\u201d thought I to myself, noting the while that as they arranged the robes they were taking in every one of us with their quick eyes. One of them shut the door, leaving Savage on this side of it as though they meant him to be present. Then they walked towards us, each of them carrying an ornamental basket made apparently of split reeds, that contained doubtless their conjuring outfit and probably the snake which Savage had found in his pocket. To my surprise they came straight to me, and, having set down the baskets, lifted their hands above their heads, as a person about to dive might do, and bowed till the points of their fingers touched the floor. Next they spoke, not in Arabic as I had expected that they would, but in Bantu, which of course I understood perfectly well.",
    "\u201cDisaster,\u201d he replied. \u201cDisaster of the worst sort.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs your wife dead, Lord Ragnall?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know. I almost hope that she is. At any rate she is lost to me.\u201d\n\nAn idea leapt to my mind to the effect that she might have run away with somebody else, a thing which often happens in the world. But fortunately I kept it to myself and only said,\n\n\u201cShe was nearly lost once before, was she not?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, when you saved her. Oh! if only you had been with us, Quatermain, this would never have happened. Listen: About eighteen months ago she had a son, a very beautiful child. She recovered well from the business and we were as happy as two mortals could be, for we loved each other, Quatermain, and God has blessed us in every way; we were so happy that I remember her telling me that our great good fortune made her feel afraid. One day last September when I was out shooting, she drove in a little pony cart we had, with the nurse, and the child but no man, to call on Mrs. Scroope who also had been recently confined. She often went out thus, for the pony was an old animal and quiet as a sheep. By some cursed trick of fate it chanced that when they were passing through the little town which you may remember near Ragnall, they met a travelling menagerie that was going to some new encampment. At the head of the procession marched a large bull elephant, which I discovered afterwards was an ill-tempered brute that had already killed a man and should never have been allowed upon the roads. The sight of the pony cart, or perhaps a red cloak which my wife was wearing, as she always liked bright colours, for some unknown reason seems to have infuriated this beast, which trumpeted. The pony becoming frightened wheeled round and overturned the cart right in front of the animal, but apparently without hurting anybody. Then\u201d\u2014here he paused a moment and with an effort continued\u2014\u201cthat devil in beast\u2019s shape cocked its ears, stretched out its long trunk, dragged the baby from the nurse\u2019s arms, whirled it round and threw it high into the air, to fall crushed upon the kerb. It sniffed at the body of the child, feeling it over with the tip of its trunk, as though to make sure that it was dead. Next, once more it trumpeted triumphantly, and without attempting to harm my wife or anybody else, walked quietly past the broken cart and continued its journey, until outside the town it was made fast and shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an awful story!\u201d I said with a gasp.\n\n\u201cYes, but there is worse to follow. My poor wife went off her head, with the shock I suppose, for no physical injury could be found upon her. She did not suffer in health or become violent, quite the reverse indeed for her gentleness increased. She just went off her head. For hours at a time she would sit silent and smiling, playing with the stones of that red necklace which those conjurers gave her, or rather counting them, as a nun might do with the beads of her rosary. At times, however, she would talk, but always to the baby, as though it lay before her or she were nursing it. Oh! Quatermain, it was pitiful, pitiful! I did everything I could. She was seen by three of the greatest brain-doctors in England, but none of them was able to help. The only hope they gave was that the fit might pass off as suddenly as it had come. They said too that a thorough change of scene would perhaps be beneficial, and suggested Egypt; that was in October. I did not take much to the idea, I don\u2019t know why, and personally should not have acceded to it had it not been for a curious circumstance. The last consultation took place in the big drawing-room at Ragnall. When it was over my wife remained with her mother at one end of the room while I and the doctors talked together at the other, as I thought quite out of her earshot. Presently, however, she called to me, saying in a perfectly clear and natural voice:\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, George, I will go to Egypt. I should like to go to Egypt.\u2019 Then she went on playing with the necklace and talking to the imaginary child. Again on the following morning as I came into her room to kiss her, she exclaimed,\n\n\u201c\u2018When do we start for Egypt? Let it be soon.\u2019\n\n\u201cWith these sayings the doctors were very pleased, declaring that they showed signs of a returning interest in life and begging me not to thwart her wish. So I gave way and in the end we went to Egypt together with Lady Longden, who insisted upon accompanying us although she is a wretched sailor. At Cairo a large dahabeeyah that I had hired in advance, manned by an excellent crew and a guard of four soldiers, was awaiting us. In it we started up the Nile. For a month or more all went well; also to my delight my wife seemed now and again to show signs of returning intelligence. Thus she took some interest in the sculptures on the walls of the temples, about which she had been very fond of reading when in health. I remember that only a few days before the\u2014the catastrophe, she pointed out one of them to me, it was of Isis and the infant Horus, saying, \u2018Look, George, the holy Mother and the holy Child,\u2019 and then bowed to it reverently as she might have done to an altar. At length after passing the First Cataract and the Island of Phil\u00e6 we came to the temple of Abu Simbel, opposite to which our boat was moored. On the following morning we explored the temple at daybreak and saw the sun strike upon the four statues which sit at its farther end, spending the rest of that day studying the colossal figures of Rameses that are carved upon its face and watching some cavalcades of Arabs mounted upon camels travelling along the banks of the Nile. My wife was unusually quiet that afternoon. For hour after hour she sat still upon the deck, gazing first at the mouth of the rock-hewn temple and the mighty figures which guard it and then at the surrounding desert. Only once did I hear her speak and then she said, \u2018Beautiful, beautiful! Now I am at home.\u2019 We dined and as there was no moon, went to bed rather early after listening to the Sudanese singers as they sang one of their weird chanties. My wife and her mother slept together in the state cabin of the dahabeeyah, which was at the stern of the boat. My cabin, a small one, was on one side of this, and that of the trained nurse on the other. The crew and the guard were forward of the saloon. A gangway was fixed from the side to the shore and over it a sentry stood, or was supposed to stand. During the night a Khamsin wind began to blow, though lightly as was to be expected at this season of the year. I did not hear it for, as a matter of fact, I slept very soundly, as it appears did everyone else upon the dahabeeyah, including the sentry as I suspect. The first thing I remember was the appearance of Lady Longden just at daybreak at the doorway of my cabin and the frightened sound of her voice asking if Luna, that is my wife, was with me. Then it transpired that she had left her cabin clad in a fur cloak, evidently some time before, as the bed in which she had been lying was quite cold. Quatermain, we searched everywhere; we searched for four days, but from that hour to this no trace whatever of her has been found.\u201d",
    "That, however, was just what Providence had not done. In the middle of the night, to be precise, at exactly two in the morning, I was awakened by Hans, who slept at the back of my shanty, into which he had crept through a hole in the faggots, exclaiming in a frightened voice,\n\n\u201cOpen your eyes and look, Baas. There are two _spooks_ waiting to see you outside, Baas.\u201d\n\nVery cautiously I lifted myself a little and stared out into the moonlight. There, seated about five paces from the open end of the hut were the \u201cspooks\u201d sure enough, two white-robed figures squatting silent and immovable on the ground. At first I was frightened. Then I bethought me of thieves and felt for my Colt pistol under the rug that served me as a pillow. As I got hold of the handle, however, a deep voice said:\n\n\u201cIs it your custom, O Macumazana, Watcher-by-Night, to receive guests with bullets?\u201d\n\nNow thought I to myself, who is there in the world who could see a man catch hold of the handle of a pistol in the recesses of a dark place and under a blanket at night, except the owner of that voice which I seemed to remember hearing in a certain drawing-room in England?\n\n\u201cYes, Har\u00fbt,\u201d I answered with an unconcerned yawn, \u201cwhen the guests come in such a doubtful fashion and in the middle of the night. But as you are here at last, will you be so good as to tell us why you have kept us waiting all this time? Is that your way of fulfilling an engagement?\u201d\n\n\u201cO Lord Macumazana,\u201d answered Har\u00fbt, for of course it was he, in quite a perturbed tone, \u201cI offer to you our humble apologies. The truth is that when we heard of your arrival at Beza-Town we started, or tried to start, from hundreds of miles away to keep our tryst with you here as we promised we would do. But we are mortal, Macumazana, and accidents intervened. Thus, when we had ascertained the weight of your baggage, camels had to be collected to carry it, which were grazing at a distance. Also it was necessary to send forward to dig out a certain well in the desert where they must drink. Hence the delay. Still, you will admit that we have arrived in time, five, or at any rate four hours before the rising of that sun which was to light you on your homeward way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you have, O Prophets, or O Liars, whichever you may be,\u201d I exclaimed with pardonable exasperation, for really their knowledge of my private affairs, however obtained, was enough to anger a saint. \u201cSo as you are here at last, come in and have a drink, for whether you are men or devils, you must be cold out there in the damp.\u201d\n\nIn they came accordingly, and, not being Mohammedans, partook of a tot of square-face from a bottle which I kept locked in a box to put Hans beyond the reach of temptation.\n\n\u201cTo your health, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt,\u201d I said, drinking a little out of the pannikin and giving the rest to Hans, who gulped the fiery liquor down with a smack of his lips. For I will admit that I joined in this unholy midnight potation to gain time for thought and to steady my nerve.\n\n\u201cTo your health, O Lord Macumazana,\u201d the pair answered as they swallowed their tots, which I had made pretty stiff, and set down their pannikins in front of them with as much reverence as though these had been holy vessels.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d I said, throwing a blanket over my shoulders, for the air was chilly, \u201cnow let us talk,\u201d and taking the lantern which Hans had thoughtfully lighted, I held it up and contemplated them.\n\nThere they were, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt without doubt, to all appearance totally unchanged since some years before I had seen them at Ragnall in England. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked in a kind of fiery indignation inspired by my intense curiosity. \u201cHow did you get out of England after you had tried to steal away the lady to whom you sent the necklace? What did you do with that lady after you had beguiled her from the boat at Abu-Simbel? In the name of your Holy Child, or of Shaitan of the Mohammedans, or of Set of the Egyptians, answer me, lest I should make an end of both of you, which I can do here without any questions being asked,\u201d and I whipped out my pistol.\n\n\u201cPardon us,\u201d said Har\u00fbt with a grave smile, \u201cbut if you were to do as you say, Lord Macumazana, many questions would be asked which _you_ might find it hard to answer. So be pleased to put that death-dealer back into its place, and to tell us before we reply to you, what you know of Set of the Egyptians.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs much or as little as you do,\u201d I replied.\n\nBoth bowed as though this information were of the most satisfactory order. Then Har\u00fbt went on: \u201cIn reply to your requests, O Macumazana, we left England by a steamboat and in due course after long journeyings we reached our own country. We do not understand your allusions to a place called Abu-Simbel on the Nile, whence, never having been there, we have taken no lady. Indeed, we never meant to take that lady to whom we sent a necklace in England. We only meant to ask certain questions of her, as she had the gift of vision, when you appeared and interrupted us. What should we want with white ladies, who have already far too many of our own?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I replied, \u201cbut I do know that you are the biggest liars I ever met.\u201d\n\nAt these words, which some might have thought insulting, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt bowed again as though to acknowledge a great compliment. Then Har\u00fbt said:\n\n\u201cLet us leave the question of ladies and come to matters that have to do with men. You are here as we told you that you would be at a time when you did not believe us, and we here to meet _you_, as we told you that we would be. How we knew that you were coming and how we came do not matter at all. Believe what you will. Are you ready to start with us, O Lord Macumazana, that you may bring to its death the wicked elephant Jana which ravages our land, and receive the great reward of ivory? If so, your camel waits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne camel cannot carry four men,\u201d I answered, avoiding the question.\n\n\u201cIn courage and skill you are more than many men, O Macumazana, yet in body you are but one and not four.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think that I am going with you alone, you are much mistaken, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHere with me is my servant without whom I do not stir,\u201d and I pointed to Hans, whom they contemplated gravely. \u201cAlso there is the Lord Ragnall, who in this land is named Igeza, and his servant who here is named Bena, the man out of whom you drew snakes in the room in England. They also must accompany us.\u201d\n\nAt this news the impassive countenances of Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt showed, I thought, some signs of disturbance. They muttered together in an unknown tongue. Then Har\u00fbt said:\n\n\u201cOur secret land is open to you alone, O Macumazana, for one purpose only\u2014to kill the elephant Jana, for which deed we promise you a great reward. We do not wish to see the others there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you can kill your own elephant, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, for not one step do I go with you. Why should I when there is as much ivory here as I want, to be had for the shooting?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow if we take you, O Macumazana?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow if I kill you both, O Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt? Fools, here are many brave men at my command, and if you or any with you want fighting it shall be given you in plenty. Hans, bid the Mazitu stand to their arms and summon Igeza and Bena.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay, Lord,\u201d said Har\u00fbt, \u201cand put down that weapon,\u201d for once more I had produced the pistol. \u201cWe would not begin our fellowship by shedding blood, though we are safer from you than you think. Your companions shall accompany you to the land of the Kendah, but let them know that they do so at their own risk. Learn that it is revealed to us that if they go in there some of them will pass out again as spirits but not as men.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean that you will murder them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. We mean that yonder are some stronger than us or any men, who will take their lives in sacrifice. Not yours, Macumazana, for that, it is decreed, is safe, but those of two of the others, which two we do not know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, Har\u00fbt and Mar\u00fbt, and how am I to be sure that any of us are safe, or that you do not but trick us to your country, there to kill us with treachery and steal our goods?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we swear it by the oath that may not be broken; we swear it by the Heavenly Child,\u201d both of them exclaimed solemnly, speaking with one voice and bowing till their foreheads almost touched the ground.",
    "The ride that followed was really quite exhilarating. The camels, notwithstanding their long journey, seemed to have caught some of the enthusiasm of the war-horse as described in the Book of Job; indeed I had no idea that they could travel at such a rate. On we swung down the slope, keeping excellent order, the forest of tall spears shining and the little lancer-like pennons fluttering on the breeze in a very gallant way. In silence we went save for the thudding of the hoofs of the camels and an occasional squeal of anger as some rider drove his lance handle into their ribs. Not until we actually joined battle did a single man open his lips. Then, it is true, there went up one simultaneous and mighty roar of:\n\n\u201cThe Child! Death to Jana! The Child! The Child!\u201d\n\nBut this happened a few minutes later.\n\nAs we drew near the enemy I saw that they had massed their footmen in a dense body, six or eight lines thick. There they stood to receive the impact of our charge, or rather they did not all stand, for the first two ranks were kneeling with long spears stretched out in front of them. I imagine that their appearance must have greatly resembled that of the Greek phalanx, or that of the Swiss prepared to receive cavalry in the Middle Ages. On either side of this formidable body, which by now must have numbered four or five hundred men, and at a distance perhaps of a quarter of a mile from them, were gathered the horsemen of the Black Kendah, divided into two bodies of nearly equal strength, say about a hundred horse in each body.\n\nAs we approached, our triangle curved a little, no doubt under the direction of Har\u00fbt. A minute or so later I saw the reason. It was that we might strike the foot-soldiers not full in front but at an angle. It was an admirable manoeuvre, for when presently we did strike, we caught them swiftly on the flank and crumpled them up. My word! we went through those fellows like a knife through butter; they had as much chance against the rush of our camels as a brown-paper screen has against a typhoon. Over they rolled in heaps while the White Kendah spitted them with their lances.\n\n\u201cThe Child is top dog! My money on the Child,\u201d reflected I in irreverent ecstasy. But that exultation was premature, for those Black Kendah were by no means all dead. Presently I saw that scores of them had appeared among the camels, which they were engaged in stabbing, or trying to stab, in the stomach with their spears. Also I had forgotten the horsemen. As our charge slackened owing to the complication in front, these arrived on our flanks like two thunderbolts. We faced about and did our best to meet the onslaught, of which the net result was that both our left and right lines were pierced through about fifty yards behind the baggage camels. Luckily for us the very impetuosity of the Black Kendah rush deprived it of most of the fruits of victory, since the two squadrons, being unable to check their horses, ended by charging into each other and becoming mixed in inextricable confusion. Then, I do not know who gave the order, we wheeled our camels in and fell upon them, a struggling, stationary mass, with the result that many of them were speared, or overthrown and trampled.\n\nI have said we, but that is not quite correct, at any rate so far as Mar\u00fbt, Hans, I and about fifteen camelmen were concerned. How it happened I could not tell in that dust and confusion, but we were cut off from the main body and presently found ourselves fighting desperately in a group at which Black Kendah horsemen were charging again and again. We made the best stand we could. By degrees the bewildered camels sank under the repeated spear-thrusts of the enemy, all except one, oddly enough that ridden by Hans, which by some strange chance was never touched. The rest of us were thrown or tumbled off the camels and continued the fight from behind their struggling bodies.",
    "When we had finished eating, that is soon, for neither of our appetites was good that morning, we walked out of the house into the surrounding compound and visited the camelmen in their hut. Here we found them squatted on the ground looking very depressed indeed. When I asked them what was the matter they replied, \u201cNothing,\u201d except that they were men about to die and life was pleasant. Also they had wives and children whom they would never see again.\n\nHaving tried to cheer them up to the best of my ability, which I fear I did without conviction, for in my heart I agreed with their view of the case, we returned to the guest-house and mounted the stair which led to the flat roof. Hence we saw that some curious ceremony was in progress in the centre of the market-place. At that distance we could not make out the details, for I forgot to say that my glasses had been stolen with the pistol and knife, probably because they were supposed to be lethal weapons or instruments of magic.\n\n\nA rough altar had been erected, on which a fire burned. Behind it the king, Simba, was seated on a stool with various councillors about him. In front of the altar was a stout wooden table, on which lay what looked like the body of a goat or a sheep. A fantastically dressed man, assisted by other men, appeared to be engaged in inspecting the inside of this animal with, we gathered, unsatisfactory results, for presently he raised his arms and uttered a loud wail. Then the creature\u2019s viscera were removed from it and thrown upon the fire, while the rest of the carcass was carried off.\n\n\nI asked Mar\u00fbt what he thought they were doing. He replied dejectedly:\n\n\u201cConsulting their Oracle; perhaps as to whether we should live or die, Macumazana.\u201d\n\n\nJust then the priest in the strange, feathered attire approached the king, carrying some small object in his hand. I wondered what it could be, till the sound of a report reached my ears and I saw the man begin to jump round upon one leg, holding the other with both his hands at the knee and howling loudly.\n\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d I said, \u201cthat pistol was full cocked, and the bullet got him in the foot.\u201d\n\n\nSimba shouted out something, whereon a man picked up the pistol and threw it into the fire, round which the others gathered to watch it burn.\n\n\n\u201cYou wait,\u201d I said to Mar\u00fbt, and as I spoke the words the inevitable happened. Off went the other barrel of the pistol, which hopped out of the fire with the recoil like a living thing. But as it happened one of the assistant priests was standing in front of the mouth of that barrel, and he also hopped once, but never again, for the heavy bullet struck him somewhere in the body and killed him. Now there was consternation. Everyone ran away, leaving the dead man lying on the ground. Simba led the rout and the head-priest brought up the rear, skipping along upon one leg.\n\n\nHaving observed these events, which filled me with an unholy joy, we descended into the house again as there was nothing more to see, also because it occurred to me that our presence on the roof, watching their discomfiture, might irritate these savages. About ten minutes later the gate of the fence round the guest-house was thrown open, and through it came four men carrying on a stretcher the body of the priest whom the bullet had killed, which they laid down in front of our door. Then followed the king with an armed guard, and after him the befeathered diviner with his foot bound up, who supported himself upon the shoulders of two of his colleagues. This man, I now perceived, wore a hideous mask, from which projected two tusks in imitation of those of an elephant. Also there were others, as many as the space would hold.\n\n\nThe king called to us to come out of the house, which, having no choice, we did. One glance at him showed me that the man was frantic with fear, or rage, or both.\n\n\n\u201cLook upon your work, magicians!\u201d he said in a terrible voice, pointing first to the dead priest, then to the diviner\u2019s wounded foot.\n\n\n\u201cIt is no work of ours, King Simba,\u201d answered Mar\u00fbt. \u201cIt is your own work. You stole the magic weapon of the white lord and made it angry, so that it has revenged itself upon you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt is true,\u201d said Simba, \u201cthat the tube has killed one of those who took it away from you and wounded the other\u201d (here was luck indeed). \u201cBut it was you who ordered it to do so, magicians. Now, hark! Yesterday I promised you safety, that no spear should pierce your hearts and no knife come near your throats, and drank the cup of peace with you. But you have broken the pact, working us more harm, and therefore it no longer holds, since there are many other ways in which men can die. Listen again! This is my decree. By your magic you have taken away the life of one of my servants and hurt another of my servants, destroying the middle toe of his left foot. If within three days you do not give back the life to him who seems to be dead, and give back the toe to him who seems to be hurt, as you well can do, then you shall join those whom you have slain in the land of death, how I will not tell you.\u201d\n\n\nNow when I heard this amazing sentence I gasped within myself, but thinking it better to keep up my r\u00f4le of understanding nothing of their talk, I preserved an immovable countenance and left Mar\u00fbt to answer. This, to his credit be it recorded, he did with his customary pleasant smile.\n\n\n\u201cO King,\u201d he said, \u201cwho can bring the dead back to life? Not even the Child itself, at any rate in this world, for there is no way.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen, Prophet of the Child, you had better find a way, or, I repeat, I send you to join them,\u201d he shouted, rolling his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cWhat did my brother, the great Prophet, promise to you but yesterday, O King, if you harmed us?\u201d asked Mar\u00fbt. \u201cWas it not that the three great curses should fall upon your people? Learn now that if so much as one of us is murdered by you, these things shall swiftly come to pass. I, Mar\u00fbt, who am also a Prophet of the Child, have said it.\u201d\n\n\nNow Simba seemed to go quite mad, so mad that I thought all was over. He waved his spear and danced about in front of us, till the silver chains clanked upon his breast. He vituperated the Child and its worshippers, who, he declared, had worked evil on the Black Kendah for generations. He appealed to his god Jana to avenge these evils, \u201cto pierce the Child with his tusks, to tear it with his trunk, and to trample it with his feet,\u201d all of which the wounded diviner ably seconded through his horrid mask.\n\n\nThere we stood before him, I leaning against the wall of the house with an air of studied nonchalance mingled with mild interest, at least that is what I meant to do, and Mar\u00fbt smiling sweetly and staring at the heavens. Whilst I was wondering what exact portion of my frame was destined to become acquainted with that spear, of a sudden Simba gave it up. Turning to his followers, he bade them dig a hole in the corner of our little enclosure and set the dead man in it, \u201cwith his head out so that he may breathe,\u201d an order which they promptly executed.\n\n\nThen he issued a command that we should be well fed and tended, and remarking that if the departed was not alive and healthy on the third morning from that day, we should hear from him again, he and his company stalked off, except those men who were occupied with the interment.",
    "On we trudged for another two hours, during which time the only living thing that I saw was a large owl which sailed round our heads as though to look at us, and then flew away ahead.\n\nThis owl, Mar\u00fbt informed me, was one of \u201cJana\u2019s spies\u201d that kept him advised of all that was passing in his territory. I muttered \u201cBosh\u201d and tramped on. Still I was glad that we saw no more of the owl, for in certain circumstances such dark fears are catching.\n\n\nWe reached the top of a rise, and there beneath us lay the most desolate scene that ever I have seen. At least it would have been the most desolate if I did not chance to have looked on it before, in the drawing-room of Ragnall Castle! There was no doubt about it. Below was the black, melancholy lake, a large sheet of water surrounded by reeds. Around, but at a considerable distance, appeared the tropical forest. To the east of the lake stretched a stony plain. At the time I could make out no more because of the uncertain light and the distance, for we had still over a mile to go before we reached the edge of the lake.\n\n\nThe aspect of the place filled me with tremblings, both because of its utter uncanniness and because of the inexplicable truth that I had seen it before. Most people will have experienced this kind of moral shock when on going to some new land they recognize a locality as being quite familiar to them in all its details. Or it may be the rooms of a house hitherto unvisited by them. Or it may be a conversation of which, when it begins, they already foreknow the sequence and the end, because in some dim state, when or how who can say, they have taken part in that talk with those same speakers. If this be so even in cheerful surroundings and among our friends or acquaintances, it is easy to imagine how much greater was the shock to me, a traveller on such a journey and in such a night.\n\n\nI shrank from approaching the shores of this lake, remembering that as yet all the vision was not unrolled. I looked about me. If we went to the left we should either strike the water, or if we followed its edge, still bearing to the left, must ultimately reach the forest, where probably we should be lost. I looked to the right. The ground was strewn with boulders, among which grew thorns and rank grass, impracticable for men on foot at night. I looked behind me, meditating retreat, and there, some hundreds of yards away behind low, scrubby mimosas mixed with aloe-like plants, I saw something brown toss up and disappear again that might very well have been the trunk of an elephant. Then, animated by the courage of despair and a desire to know the worst, I began to descend the elephant track towards the lake almost at a run.\n\n\nTen minutes or so more brought us to the eastern head of the lake, where the reeds whispered in the breath of the night wind like things alive. As I expected, it proved to be a bare, open space where nothing seemed to grow. Yes, and all about me were the decaying remains of elephants, hundreds of them, some with their bones covered in moss, that may have lain here for generations, and others more newly dead. They were all old beasts as I could tell by the tusks, whether male or female. Indeed about me within a radius of a quarter of a mile lay enough ivory to make a man very rich for life, since although discoloured, much of it seemed to have kept quite sound, like human teeth in a mummy case. The sight gave me a new zest for life. If only I could manage to survive and carry off that ivory! I would. In this way or in that I swore that I would! Who could possibly die with so much ivory to be had for the taking? Not that old hunter, Allan Quatermain.\n\n\nThen I forgot about the ivory, for there in front of me, just where it should be, just as I had seen it in the dream-picture, was the bull elephant dying, a thin and ancient brute that had lived its long life to the last hour. It searched about as though to find a convenient resting-place, and when this was discovered, stood over it, swaying to and fro for a full minute. Then it lifted its trunk and trumpeted shrilly thrice, singing its swan-song, after which it sank slowly to its knees, its trunk outstretched and the points of its worn tusks resting on the ground. Evidently it was dead.\n\n\nI let my eyes travel on, and behold! about fifty yards beyond the dead bull was a mound of hard rock. I watched it with gasping expectation and\u2014yes, on the top of the mound something slowly materialized. Although I knew what it must be well enough, for a while I could not see quite clearly because there were certain little clouds about and one of them had floated over the face of the moon. It passed, and before me, perhaps a hundred and forty paces away, outlined clearly against the sky, I perceived the devilish elephant of my vision.\n\n\nOh! what a brute was that! In bulk and height it appeared to be half as big again as any of its tribe which I had known in all my life\u2019s experience. It was enormous, unearthly; a survivor perhaps of some ancient species that lived before the Flood, or at least a very giant of its kind. Its grey-black sides were scarred as though with fighting. One of its huge tusks, much worn at the end, for evidently it was very old, gleamed white in the moonlight. The other was broken off about halfway down its length. When perfect it had been malformed, for it curved downwards and not upwards, also rather out to the right.\n\n\nThere stood this mammoth, this leviathan, this _monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens_, as I remember my old father used to call a certain gigantic and misshapen bull that we had on the Station, flapping a pair of ears that looked like the sides of a Kafir hut, and waving a trunk as big as a weaver\u2019s beam\u2014whatever a weaver\u2019s beam may be\u2014an appalling and a petrifying sight.\n\n\nI squatted behind the skeleton of an elephant which happened to be handy and well covered with moss and ferns and watched the beast, fascinated, wishing that I had a large-bore rifle in my hand. What became of Mar\u00fbt I do not exactly know, but I think that he lay down on the ground.\n\n\nDuring the minute or so that followed I reflected a good deal, as we do in times of emergency, often after a useless sort of a fashion. For instance, I wondered why the brute appeared thus upon yonder mound, and the thought suggested itself to me that it was summoned thither from some neighbouring lair by the trumpet call of the dying elephant. It occurred to me even that it was a kind of king of the elephants, to which they felt bound to report themselves, as it were, in the hour of their decease. Certainly what followed gave some credence to my fantastical notion which, if there were anything in it, might account for this great graveyard at that particular spot.\n\n\nAfter standing for a while in the attitude that I have described, testing the air with its trunk, Jana, for I will call him so, lumbered down the mound and advanced straight to where the elephant that I had thought to be dead was kneeling. As a matter of fact it was not quite dead, for when Jana arrived it lifted its trunk and curled it round that of Jana as though in affectionate greeting, then let it fall to the ground again. Thereon Jana did what I had seen it do in my dream or vision at Ragnall, namely, attacked it, knocking it over on to its side, where it lay motionless; quite dead this time.\n\n\nNow I remembered that the vision was not accurate after all, since in it I had seen Jana destroy a woman and a child, who on the present occasion were wanting. Since then I have thought that this was because Har\u00fbt, clairvoyantly or telepathically, had conveyed to me, as indeed Mar\u00fbt declared, a scene which he had witnessed similar to that which I was witnessing, but not identical in its incidents. Thus it happened, perhaps, that while the act of the woman and the child was omitted, in our case there was another act of the play to follow of which I had received no inkling in my Ragnall experience. Indeed, if I had received it, I should not have been there that night, for no inducement on earth would have brought me to Kendahland.",
    "Thus the long night wore away. Our progress was very slow, but guided by occasional glimpses at the compass we never stopped but twice, once when we found ourselves apparently surrounded by tree boles and fallen boughs, and once when we got into swampy ground. Then we took the risk of lighting the lantern, and by its aid picked our way through these difficult places. By degrees the trees grew fewer so that we could see the stars between their tops. This was a help to us as I knew that one of them, which I had carefully noted, shone at this season of the year directly over the cone of the mountain, and we were enabled to steer thereby.\n\nIt must have been not more than half an hour before the dawn that Hans, who was leading\u2014we were pushing our way through thick bushes at the time\u2014halted hurriedly, saying:\n\n\n\u201cStop, Baas, we are on the edge of a cliff. When I thrust my stick forward it stands on nothing.\u201d\n\n\nNeedless to say we pulled up dead and so remained without stirring an inch, for who could say what might be beyond us? Ragnall wished to examine the ground with the lantern. I was about to consent, though doubtfully, when suddenly I heard voices murmuring and through the screen of bushes saw lights moving at a little distance, forty feet or more below us. Then we gave up all idea of making further use of the lantern and crouched still as mice in our bushes, waiting for the dawn.\n\n\nIt came at last. In the east appeared a faint pearly flush that by degrees spread itself over the whole arch of the sky and was welcomed by the barking of monkeys and the call of birds in the depths of the dew-steeped forest. Next a ray from the unrisen sun, a single spear of light shot suddenly across the sky, and as it appeared, from the darkness below us arose a sound of chanting, very low and sweet to hear. It died away and for a little while there was silence broken only by a rustling sound like to that of people taking their seats in a dark theatre. Then a woman began to sing in a beautiful, contralto voice, but in what language I do not know, for I could not catch the words, if these were words and not only musical notes.\n\n\nI felt Ragnall trembling beside me and in a whisper asked him what was the matter. He answered, also in a whisper:\n\n\n\u201cI believe that is my wife\u2019s voice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf so, I beg you to control yourself,\u201d I replied.\n\n\nNow the skies began to flame and the light to pour itself into a misty hollow beneath us like streams of many-coloured gems into a bowl, driving away the shadows. By degrees these vanished; by degrees we saw everything. Beneath us was an amphitheatre, on the southern wall of which we were seated, though it was not a wall but a lava cliff between forty and fifty feet high which served as a wall. The amphitheatre itself, however, almost exactly resembled those of the ancients which I had seen in pictures and Ragnall had visited in Italy, Greece, and Southern France. It was oval in shape and not very large, perhaps the flat space at the bottom may have covered something over an acre, but all round this oval ran tiers of seats cut in the lava of the crater. For without doubt this was the crater of an extinct volcano.\n\n\nMoreover, in what I will call the arena, stood a temple that in its main outlines, although small, exactly resembled those still to be seen in Egypt. There was the gateway or pylon; there the open outer court with columns round it supporting roofed cloisters, which, as we ascertained afterwards, were used as dwelling-places by the priests. There beyond and connected with the first by a short passage was a second rather smaller court, also open to the sky, and beyond this again, built like all the rest of the temple of lava blocks, a roofed erection measuring about twelve feet square, which I guessed at once must be the sanctuary.\n\n\nThis temple was, as I have said, small, but extremely well proportioned, every detail of it being in the most excellent taste though unornamented by sculpture or painting. I have to add that in front of the sanctuary door stood a large block of lava, which I concluded was an altar, and in front of this a stone seat and a basin, also of stone, supported upon a very low tripod. Further, behind the sanctuary was a square house with window-places.\n\n\nAt the moment of our first sight of this place the courts were empty, but on the benches of the amphitheatre were seated about three hundred persons, male and female, the men to the north and the women to the south. They were all clad in pure white robes, the heads of the men being shaved and those of the women veiled, but leaving the face exposed. Lastly, there were two roadways into the amphitheatre, one running east and one west through tunnels hollowed in the encircling rock of the crater, both of which roads were closed at the mouths of the tunnels by massive wooden double doors, seventeen or eighteen feet in height. From these roadways and their doors we learned two things. First, that the cave where had lived the Father of Serpents was, as I had suspected, not the real approach to the shrine of the Child, but only a blind; and, secondly, that the ceremony we were about to witness was secret and might only be attended by the priestly class or families of this strange tribe.\n\n\nScarcely was it full daylight when from the cells of the cloisters round the outer court issued twelve priests headed by Har\u00fbt himself, who looked very dignified in his white garment, each of whom carried on a wooden platter ears of different kinds of corn. Then from the cells of the southern cloister issued twelve women, or rather girls, for all were young and very comely, who ranged themselves alongside of the men. These also carried wooden platters, and on them blooming flowers.\n\n\nAt a sign they struck up a religious chant and began to walk forward through the passage that led from the first court to the second. Arriving in front of the altar they halted and one by one, first a priest and then a priestess, set down the platters of offerings, piling them above each other into a cone. Next the priests and the priestesses ranged themselves in lines on either side of the altar, and Har\u00fbt took a platter of corn and a platter of flowers in his hands. These he held first towards that quarter of the sky in which swam the invisible new moon, secondly towards the rising sun, and thirdly towards the doors of the sanctuary, making genuflexions and uttering some chanted prayer, the words of which we could not hear.\n\n\nA pause followed, that was succeeded by a sudden outburst of song wherein all the audience took part. It was a very sonorous and beautiful song or hymn in some language which I did not understand, divided into four verses, the end of each verse being marked by the bowing of every one of those many singers towards the east, towards the west, and finally towards the altar.\n\n\nAnother pause till suddenly the doors of the sanctuary were thrown wide and from between them issued\u2014the goddess Isis of the Egyptians as I have seen her in pictures! She was wrapped in closely clinging draperies of material so thin that the whiteness of her body could be seen beneath. Her hair was outspread before her, and she wore a head-dress or bonnet of glittering feathers from the front of which rose a little golden snake. In her arms she bore what at that distance seemed to be a naked child. With her came two women, walking a little behind her and supporting her arms, who also wore feather bonnets but without the golden snake, and were clad in tight-fitting, transparent garments.\n\n\n\u201cMy God!\u201d whispered Ragnall, \u201cit is my wife!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThen be silent and thank Him that she is alive and well,\u201d I answered.\n\n\nThe goddess Isis, or the English lady\u2014in that excitement I did not reck which\u2014stood still while the priests and priestesses and all the audience, who, gathered on the upper benches of the amphitheatre, could see her above the wall of the inner court, raised a thrice-repeated and triumphant cry of welcome. Then Har\u00fbt and the first priestess lifted respectively an ear of corn and a flower from the two topmost platters and held these first to the lips of the child in her arms and secondly to her lips.\n\n\nThis ceremony concluded, the two attendant women led her round the altar to the stone chair, upon which she seated herself. Next fire was kindled in the bowl on the tripod in front of the chair, how I could not see; but perhaps it was already smouldering there. At any rate it burnt up in a thin blue flame, on to which Har\u00fbt and the head priestess threw something that caused the flame to turn to smoke. Then Isis, for I prefer to call her so while describing this ceremony, was caused to bend her head forward, so that it was enveloped in the smoke exactly as she and I had done some years before in the drawing-room at Ragnall Castle. Presently the smoke died away and the two attendants with the feathered head-dresses straightened her in the chair where she sat still holding the babe against her breast as she might have done to nurse it, but with her head bent forward like that of a person in a swoon.\n\n\nNow Har\u00fbt stepped forward and appeared to speak to the goddess at some length, then fell back again and waited, till in the midst of an intense silence she rose from her seat and, fixing her wide eyes on the heavens, spoke in her turn, for although we heard nothing of what she said, in that clear, morning light we could see her lips moving. For some minutes she spoke, then sat down again upon the chair and remained motionless, staring straight in front of her. Har\u00fbt advanced again, this time to the front of the altar, and, taking his stand upon a kind of stone step, addressed the priests and priestesses and all the encircling audience in a voice so loud and clear that I could distinguish and understand every word he said.\n\n\n\u201cThe Guardian of the heavenly Child, the Nurse decreed, the appointed Nurturer, She who is the shadow of her that bore the Child, She who in her day bears the symbol of the Child and is consecrated to its service from of old, She whose heart is filled with the wisdom of the Child and who utters the decrees of Heaven, has spoken. Hearken now to the voice of the Oracle uttered in answer to the questions of me, Har\u00fbt, the head priest of the Eternal Child during my life-days. Thus says the Oracle, the Guardian, the Nurturer, marked like all who went before her with the holy mark of the new moon. She on whom the spirit, flitting from generation to generation, has alighted for a while. \u2018O people of the White Kendah, worshippers of the Child in this land and descen",
    "So behind our screen of bushes we wriggled back a little distance till we knew that the slope of the ground would hide us when we stood up. Then as quickly as we could we made our way eastwards for something over a quarter of a mile and after this turned to the north. As I expected, beyond the ring of the crater we found ourselves on the rising, tree-clad bosom of the mountain and, threading our path through the cedars, came presently to that track or roadway which led to the eastern gate of the amphitheatre. This road we followed unseen until presently the gateway appeared before us. We walked through it without attracting any attention, perhaps because all the people were either talking together, or praying, or perhaps because like themselves we were wrapped in white robes. At the mouth of the tunnel we stopped and I called out in a loud voice:\n\n\u201cThe white lords and their servant have come to visit Har\u00fbt, as he invited them to do. Bring us, we pray you, into the presence of Har\u00fbt.\u201d\n\nEveryone wheeled round and stared at us standing there in the shadow of the gateway tunnel, for the sun behind us was still low. My word, how they did stare! A voice cried:\n\n\u201cKill them! Kill these strangers who desecrate our temple.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d I answered. \u201cWould you kill those to whom your high-priest has given safe-conduct; those moreover by whose help alone, as your Oracle has just declared, you can hope to slay Jana and destroy his hosts?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do they know that?\u201d shouted another voice. \u201cThey are magicians!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I remarked, \u201call magic does not dwell in the hearts of the White Kendah. If you doubt it, go to look at the Watcher in the Cave whom your Oracle told you is dead. You will find that it did not lie.\u201d\n\nAs I spoke a man rushed through the gates, his white robe streaming on the wind, shouting as he emerged from the tunnel:\n\n\u201cO Priests and Priestesses of the Child, the ancient serpent is dead. I whose office it is to feed the serpent on the day of the new moon have found him dead in his house.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear,\u201d I interpolated calmly. \u201cThe Father of Snakes is dead. If you want to know how, I will tell you. We looked on it and it died.\u201d\n\nThey might have answered that poor Savage also looked on it with the result that _he_ died, but luckily it did not occur to them to do so. On the contrary, they just stood still and stared at us like a flock of startled sheep.\n\n\nPresently the sheep parted and the shepherd in the shape of Har\u00fbt appeared looking, I reflected, the very picture of Abraham softened by a touch of the melancholia of Job, that is, as I have always imagined those patriarchs. He bowed to us with his usual Oriental courtesy, and we bowed back to him. Hans\u2019 bow, I may explain, was of the most peculiar nature, more like a _skulpat_, as the Boers call a land-tortoise, drawing its wrinkled head into its shell and putting it out again than anything else. Then Har\u00fbt remarked in his peculiar English, which I suppose the White Kendah took for some tongue known only to magicians:\n\n\u201cSo you get here, eh? Why you get here, how the devil you get here, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got here because you asked us to do so if we could,\u201d I answered, \u201cand we thought it rude not to accept your invitation. For the rest, we came through a cave where you kept a tame snake, an ugly-looking reptile but very harmless to those who know how to deal with snakes and are not afraid of them as poor Bena was. If you can spare the skin I should like to have it to make myself a robe.\u201d\n\nHar\u00fbt looked at me with evident respect, muttering:\n\n\u201cOh, Macumazana, you what you English call cool, quite cool! Is that all?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I answered. \u201cAlthough you did not happen to notice us, we have been present at your church service, and heard and seen everything. For instance, we saw the wife of the lord here whom you stole away in Egypt, her that, being a liar, Har\u00fbt, you swore you never stole. Also we heard her words after you had made her drunk with your tobacco smoke.\u201d\n\nNow for once in his life Har\u00fbt was, in sporting parlance, knocked out. He looked at us, then turning quite pale, lifted his eyes to heaven and rocked upon his feet as though he were about to fall.\n\n\u201cHow you do it? How you do it, eh?\u201d he queried in a weak voice.\n\n\u201cNever you mind how we did it, my friend,\u201d I answered loftily. \u201cWhat we want to know is when you are going to hand over that lady to her husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot possible,\u201d he answered, recovering some of his tone. \u201cFirst we kill you, first we kill her, she Nurse of the Child. While Child there, she stop there till she die.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee here,\u201d broke in Ragnall. \u201cEither you give me my wife or someone else will die. You will die, Har\u00fbt. I am a stronger man than you are and unless you promise to give me my wife I will kill you now with this stick and my hands. Do not move or call out if you want to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cLord,\u201d answered the old man with some dignity, \u201cI know you can kill me, and if you kill me, I think I say thank you who no wish to live in so much trouble. But what good that, since in one minute then you die too, all of you, and lady she stop here till Black Kendah king take her to wife or she too die?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us talk,\u201d I broke in, treading warningly upon Ragnall\u2019s foot. \u201cWe have heard your Oracle and we know that you believe its words. It is said that we alone can help you to conquer the Black Kendah. If you will not promise what we ask, we will not help you. We will burn our powder and melt our lead, so that the guns we have cannot speak with Jana and with Simba, and after that we will do other things that I need not tell you. But if you promise what we ask, then we will fight for you against Jana and Simba and teach your men to use the fifty rifles which we have here with us, and by our help you shall conquer. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nHe nodded and stroking his long beard, asked:\n\n\u201cWhat you want us promise, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want you to promise that after Jana is dead and the Black Kendah are driven away, you will give up to us unharmed that lady whom you have stolen. Also that you will bring her and us safely out of your country by the roads you know, and meanwhile that you will let this lord see his wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot last, no,\u201d replied Har\u00fbt, \u201cthat not possible. That bring us all to grave. Also no good, \u2018cause her mind empty. For rest, you come to other place, sit down and eat while I talk with priests. Be afraid nothing; you quite safe.\u201d",
    "The ceremonies were over and the priests, with the exception of Har\u00fbt and two who remained to attend upon him, vanished, probably to inform the male and female hierophants of their result, and through these the whole people of the White Kendah. Old Har\u00fbt stared at us for a little while, then said in English, which he always liked to talk when Ragnall was present, perhaps for the sake of practice:\n\n\u201cWhat you like do now, eh? P\u2019r\u2019aps wish fly back to Town of Child, for suppose this how you come. If so, please take me with you, because that save long ride.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! no,\u201d I answered. \u201cWe walked here through that hole where lived the Father of Snakes who died of fear when he saw us, and just mixed with the rest of you in the court of the temple.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood lie,\u201d said Har\u00fbt admiringly, \u201cvery first-class lie! Wonder how you kill great snake, which we all think never die, for he live there hundred, hundred years; our people find him there when first they come to this country, and make him kind of god. Well, he nasty beast and best dead. I say, you like see Child? If so, come, for you our brothers now, only please take off hat and not speak.\u201d\n\nI intimated that we should \u201clike see Child,\u201d and led by Har\u00fbt we entered the little sanctuary which was barely large enough to hold all of us. In a niche of the end wall stood the sacred effigy which Ragnall and I examined with a kind of reverent interest. It proved to be the statue of an infant about two feet high, cut, I imagine, from the base of a single but very large elephant\u2019s tusk, so ancient that the yellowish ivory had become rotten and was covered with a multitude of tiny fissures. Indeed, for its appearance I made up my mind that several thousands of years must have passed since the beast died from which this ivory was taken, especially as it had, I presume, always been carefully preserved under cover.\n\nThe workmanship of the object was excellent, that of a fine artist who, I should think, had taken some living infant for his model, perhaps a child of the Pharaoh of the day. Here I may say at once that there could be no doubt of its Egyptian origin, since on one side of the head was a single lock of hair, while the fourth finger of the right hand was held before the lips as though to enjoin silence. Both of these peculiarities, it will be remembered, are characteristic of the infant Horus, the child of Osiris and Isis, as portrayed in bronzes and temple carvings. So at least Ragnall, who recently had studied many such effigies in Egypt, informed me later. There was nothing else in the place except an ancient, string-seated chair of ebony, adorned with inlaid ivory patterns; an effigy of a snake in porcelain, showing that serpent worship was in some way mixed up with their religion; and two rolls of papyrus, at least that is what they looked like, which were laid in the niche with the statue. These rolls, to my disappointment, Har\u00fbt refused to allow us to examine or even to touch.\n\nAfter we had left the sanctuary I asked Har\u00fbt when this figure was brought to their land. He replied that it came when they came, at what date he could not tell us as it was so long ago, and that with it came the worship and the ceremonies of their religion.\n\nIn answer to further questions he added that this figure, which seemed to be of ivory, contained the spirits which ruled the sun and the moon, and through them the world. This, said Ragnall, was just a piece of Egyptian theology, preserved down to our own times in a remote corner of Africa, doubtless by descendants of dwellers on the Nile who had been driven thence in some national catastrophe, and brought away with them their faith and one of the effigies of their gods. Perhaps they fled at the time of the Persian invasion by Cambyses.\n\nAfter we had emerged from this deeply interesting shrine, which was locked behind us, Har\u00fbt led us, not through the passage connecting it with the stone house that we knew was occupied by Ragnall\u2019s wife in her capacity as Guardian of the Child, or a latter-day personification of Isis, Lady of the Moon, at which house he cast many longing glances, but back through the two courts and the pylon to the gateway of the temple. Here on the road by which we had entered the place, a fact which we did not mention to him, he paused and addressed us.\n\n\n\u201cLords,\u201d he said, \u201cnow you and the People of the White Kendah are one; your ends are their ends, your fate is their fate, their secrets are your secrets. You, Lord Igeza, work for a reward, namely the person of that lady whom we took from you on the Nile.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d interrupted Ragnall when I had interpreted.\n\n\u201cLord, we watched you. We knew when you came to Egypt; we followed you in Egypt, whither we had journeyed on our road to England once more to seek our Oracles, till the day of our opportunity dawned. Then at night we called her and she obeyed the call, as she must do whose mind we have taken away\u2014ask me not how\u2014and brought her to dwell with us, she who is marked from her birth with the holy sign and wears upon her breast certain charmed stones and a symbol that for thousands of years have adorned the body of the Child and those of its Oracles. Do you remember a company of Arabs whom you saw riding on the banks of the Great River on the day before the night when she was lost to you? We were with that company and on our camels we bore her thence, happy and unharmed to this our land, as I trust, when all is done, we shall bear her back again and you with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI trust so also, for you have wrought me a great wrong,\u201d said Ragnall briefly, \u201cperhaps a greater wrong than I know at present, for how came it that my boy was killed by an elephant?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk that question of Jana and not of me,\u201d Har\u00fbt answered darkly. Then he went on: \u201cYou also, Lord Macumazana, work for a reward, the countless store of ivory which your eyes have beheld lying in the burial place of elephants beyond the Tava River. When you have slain Jana who watches the store, and defeated the Black Kendah who serve him, it is yours and we will give you camels to bear it, or some of it, for all cannot be carried, to the sea where it can be taken away in ships. As for the yellow man, I think that he seeks no reward who soon will inherit all things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe old witch-doctor means that I am going to die,\u201d remarked Hans expectorating reflectively. \u201cWell, Baas, I am quite ready, if only Jana and certain others die first. Indeed I grow too old to fight and travel as I used to do, and therefore shall be glad to pass to some land where I become young again.\u201d\n\n\u201cStuff and rubbish!\u201d I exclaimed, then turned and listened to Har\u00fbt who, not understanding our Dutch conversation, was speaking once more.\n\n\u201cLords,\u201d he said, \u201cthese paths which run east and west are the real approach to the mountain top and the temple, not that which, as I suppose, led you through the cave of the old serpent. The road to the west, which wanders round the base of the hill to a pass in those distant mountains and thence across the deserts to the north, is so easy to stop that by it we need fear no attack. With this eastern road the case is, however, different, as I shall now show you, if you will ride with me.\u201d",
    "On they came, slowly and steadily, preceded by a cloud of skirmishers\u2014a thousand or more of these\u2014who kept as open an order as the narrow ground would allow and carried, each of them, a bundle of throwing spears arranged in loops or sockets at the back of the shield. When these men were about a hundred yards away we opened fire and killed a great number of them, also some of the marshalled troops behind. But this did not stop them in the least, for what could fifty rifles do against a horde of brave barbarians who, it seemed, had no fear of death? Presently their spears were falling among us and a few casualties began to occur, not many, because of the protecting wall, but still some. Again and again we loaded and fired, sweeping away those in front of us, but always others came to take their places. Finally at some word of command these light skirmishers vanished, except whose who were dead or wounded, taking shelter behind the advancing regiments which now were within fifty yards of us.\n\nThen, after a momentary pause another command was shouted out and the first regiment charged in three solid ranks. We fired a volley point blank into them and, as it was hopeless for fifty men to withstand such an onslaught, bolted during the temporary confusion that ensued, taking refuge, as it had been arranged that we should do, at a point of vantage farther down the line of fortifications, whence we maintained our galling fire.\n\nNow it was that the main body of the White Kendah came into action under the leadership of Ragnall and Har\u00fbt. The enemy scrambled over the first wall, which we had just vacated, to find themselves in a network of other walls held by our spearmen in a narrow place where numbers gave no great advantage.\n\nHere the fighting was terrible and the loss of the attackers great, for always as they carried one entrenchment they found another a few yards in front of them, out of which the defenders could only be driven at much cost of life.\n\nTwo hours or more the battle went on thus. In spite of the desperate resistance which we offered, the multitude of the Black Kendah, who I must say fought magnificently, stormed wall after wall, leaving hundreds of dead and wounded to mark their difficult progress. Meanwhile I and my riflemen rained bullets on them from certain positions which we had selected beforehand, until at length our ammunition began to run low.\n\nAt half-past eight in the morning we were driven back over the open ground to our last entrenchment, a very strong one just outside of the eastern gate of the temple which, it will be remembered, was set in a tunnel pierced through the natural lava rock. Thrice did the Black Kendah come on and thrice we beat them off, till the ditch in front of the wall was almost full of fallen. As fast as they climbed to the top of it the White Kendah thrust them through with their long spears, or we shot them with our rifles, the nature of the ground being such that only a direct frontal attack was possible.\n\nIn the end they drew back sullenly, having, as we hoped, given up the assault. As it turned out, this was not so. They were only resting and waiting for the arrival of their reserve. It came up shouting and singing a war-song, two thousand strong or more, and presently once more they charged like a flood of water. We beat them back. They reformed and charged a second time and we beat them back.\n\nThen they took another counsel. Standing among the dead and dying at the base of the wall, which was built of loose stones and earth, where we could not easily get at them because of the showers of spears which were rained at anyone who showed himself, they began to undermine it, levering out the bottom stones with stakes and battering them with poles.\n\nIn five minutes a breach appeared, through which they poured tumultuously. It was hopeless to withstand that onslaught of so vast a number. Fighting desperately, we were driven down the tunnel and through the doors that were opened to us, into the first court of the temple. By furious efforts we managed to close these doors and block them with stones and earth. But this did not avail us long, for, bringing brushwood and dry grass, they built a fire against them that soon caught the thick cedar wood of which they were made.\n\n\nWhile they burned we consulted together. Further retreat seemed impossible, since the second court of the temple, save for a narrow passage, was filled with corn which allowed no room for fighting, while behind it were gathered all the women and children, more than two thousand of them. Here, or nowhere, we must make our stand and conquer or die. Up to this time, compared with what which we had inflicted upon the Black Kendah, of whom a couple of thousand or more had fallen, our loss was comparatively slight, say two hundred killed and as many more wounded. Most of such of the latter as could not walk we had managed to carry into the first court of the temple, laying them close against the cloister walls, whence they watched us in a grisly ring.\n\nThis left us about sixteen hundred able-bodied men or many more than we could employ with effect in that narrow place. Therefore we determined to act upon a plan which we had already designed in case such an emergency as ours should arise. About three hundred and fifty of the best men were to remain to defend the temple till all were slain. The rest, to the number of over a thousand, were to withdraw through the second court and the gates beyond to the camp of the women and children. These they were to conduct by secret paths that were known to them to where the camels were kraaled, and mounting as many as possible of them on the camels to fly whither they could. Our hope was that the victorious Black Kendah would be too exhausted to follow them across the plain to the distant mountains. It was a dreadful determination, but we had no choice."

  "H. Rider Haggard -- Finished": [
    "You, my friend, into whose hand, if you live, I hope these scribblings of mine will pass one day, must well remember the 12th of April of the year 1877 at Pretoria. Sir Theophilus Shepstone, or Sompseu, for I prefer to call him by his native name, having investigated the affairs of the Transvaal for a couple of months or so, had made up his mind to annex that country to the British Crown. It so happened that I, Allan Quatermain, had been on a shooting and trading expedition at the back of the Lydenburg district where there was plenty of game to be killed in those times. Hearing that great events were toward I made up my mind, curiosity being one of my weaknesses, to come round by Pretoria, which after all was not very far out of my way, instead of striking straight back to Natal. As it chanced I reached the town about eleven o\u2019clock on this very morning of the 12th of April and, trekking to the Church Square, proceeded to outspan there, as was usual in the Seventies. The place was full of people, English and Dutch together, and I noted that the former seemed very elated and were talking excitedly, while the latter for the most part appeared to be sullen and depressed.\n\nPresently I saw a man I knew, a tall, dark man, a very good fellow and an excellent shot, named Robinson. By the way you knew him also, for afterwards he was an officer in the Pretoria Horse at the time of the Zulu war, the corps in which you held a commission. I called to him and asked what was up.\n\n\u201cA good deal, Allan,\u201d he said as he shook my hand. \u201cIndeed we shall be lucky if all isn\u2019t up, or something like it, before the day is over. Shepstone\u2019s Proclamation annexing the Transvaal is going to be read presently.\u201d\n\nI whistled and asked,\n\n\u201cHow will our Boer friends take it? They don\u2019t look very pleased.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what no one knows, Allan. Burgers the President is squared, they say. He is to have a pension; also he thinks it the only thing to be done. Most of the Hollanders up here don\u2019t like it, but I doubt whether they will put out their hands further than they can draw them back. The question is\u2014what will be the line of the Boers themselves? There are a lot of them about, all armed, you see, and more outside the town.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell you. Anything may happen. They may shoot Shepstone and his staff and the twenty-five policemen, or they may just grumble and go home. Probably they have no fixed plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about the English?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! we are all crazy with joy, but of course there is no organization and many have no arms. Also there are only a few of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I answered, \u201cI came here to look for excitement, life having been dull for me of late, and it seems that I have found it. Still I bet you those Dutchmen do nothing, except protest. They are slim and know that the shooting of an unarmed mission would bring England on their heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t say, I am sure. They like Shepstone who understands them, and the move is so bold that it takes their breath away. But as the Kaffirs say, when a strong wind blows a small spark will make the whole veld burn. It just depends upon whether the spark is there. If an Englishman and a Boer began to fight for instance, anything might happen. Goodbye, I have got a message to deliver. If things go right we might dine at the European tonight, and if they don\u2019t, goodness knows where we shall dine.\u201d\n\nI nodded sagely and he departed. Then I went to my wagon to tell the boys not to send the oxen off to graze at present, for I feared lest they should be stolen if there were trouble, but to keep them tied to the trek-tow. After this I put on the best coat and hat I had, feeling that as an Englishman it was my duty to look decent on such an occasion, washed, brushed my hair\u2014with me a ceremony without meaning, for it always sticks up\u2014and slipped a loaded Smith & Wesson revolver into my inner poacher pocket. Then I started out to see the fun, and avoiding the groups of surly-looking Boers, mingled with the crowd that I saw was gathering in front of a long, low building with a broad stoep, which I supposed, rightly, to be one of the Government offices.\n\n\nPresently I found myself standing by a tall, rather loosely-built man whose face attracted me. It was clean-shaven and much bronzed by the sun, but not in any way good-looking; the features were too irregular and the nose was a trifle too long for good looks. Still the impression it gave was pleasant and the steady blue eyes had that twinkle in them which suggests humour. He might have been thirty or thirty-five years of age, and notwithstanding his rough dress that consisted mainly of a pair of trousers held up by a belt to which hung a pistol, and a common flannel shirt, for he wore no coat, I guessed at once that he was English-born.\n\nFor a while neither of us said anything after the taciturn habit of our people even on the veld, and indeed I was fully occupied in listening to the truculent talk of a little party of mounted Boers behind us. I put my pipe into my mouth and began to hunt for my tobacco, taking the opportunity to show the hilt of my revolver, so that these men might see that I was armed. It was not to be found, I had left it in the wagon.\n\n\u201cIf you smoke Boer tobacco,\u201d said the stranger, \u201cI can help you,\u201d and I noted that the voice was as pleasant as the face, and knew at once that the owner of it was a gentleman.\n\n\u201cThank you, Sir. I never smoke anything else,\u201d I answered, whereon he produced from his trousers pocket a pouch made of lion skin of unusually dark colour.\n\n\u201cI never saw a lion as black as this, except once beyond Buluwayo on the borders of Lobengula\u2019s country,\u201d I said by way of making conversation.\n\n\u201cCurious,\u201d answered the stranger, \u201cfor that\u2019s where I shot the brute a few months ago. I tried to keep the whole skin but the white ants got at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeen trading up there?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNothing so useful,\u201d he said. \u201cJust idling and shooting. Came to this country because it was one of the very few I had never seen, and have only been here a year. I think I have had about enough of it, though. Can you tell me of any boats running from Durban to India? I should like to see those wild sheep in Kashmir.\u201d\n\nI told him that I did not know for certain as I had never taken any interest in India, being an African elephant-hunter and trader, but I thought they did occasionally. Just then Robinson passed by and called to me\u2014\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be here presently, Quatermain, but Sompseu isn\u2019t coming himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes your name happen to be Allan Quatermain?\u201d asked the stranger. \u201cIf so I have heard plenty about you up in Lobengula\u2019s country, and of your wonderful shooting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, \u201cbut as for the shooting, natives always exaggerate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey never exaggerated about mine,\u201d he said with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cAnyhow I am very glad to see you in the flesh, though in the spirit you rather bored me because I heard too much of you. Whenever I made a particularly bad miss, my gun-bearer, who at some time seems to have been yours, would say, \u2018Ah! if only it had been the Inkosi Macumazahn, how different would have been the end!\u2019 My name is Anscombe, Maurice Anscombe,\u201d he added rather shyly. (Afterwards I discovered from a book of reference that he was a younger son of Lord Mountford, one of the richest peers in England.)\n\nThen we both laughed and he said\u2014\n\n\u201cTell me, Mr. Quatermain, if you will, what those Boers are saying behind us. I am sure it is something unpleasant, but as the only Dutch I know is \u2018Guten Tag\u2019 and \u2018Vootsack\u2019 (Good-day and Get out) that takes me no forwarder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ought to,\u201d I answered, \u201cfor the substance of their talk is that they object to be \u2018vootsacked\u2019 by the British Government as represented by Sir Theophilus Shepstone. They are declaring that they won the land \u2018with their blood\u2019 and want to keep their own flag flying over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very natural sentiment,\u201d broke in Anscombe.\n\n\u201cThey say that they wish to shoot all damned Englishmen, especially Shepstone and his people, and that they would make a beginning now were they not afraid that the damned English Government, being angered, would send thousands of damned English rooibatjes, that is, red-coats, and shoot _them_ out of evil revenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very natural conclusion,\u201d laughed Anscombe again, \u201cwhich I should advise them to leave untested. Hush! Here comes the show.\u201d\n\nI looked and saw a body of blackcoated gentlemen with one officer in the uniform of a Colonel of Engineers, advancing slowly. I remember that it reminded me of a funeral procession following the corpse of the Republic that had gone on ahead out of sight. The procession arrived upon the stoep opposite to us and began to sort itself out, whereon the English present raised a cheer and the Boers behind us cursed audibly. In the middle appeared an elderly gentleman with whiskers and a stoop, in whom I recognized Mr. Osborn, known by the Kaffirs as Malimati, the Chief of the Staff. By his side was a tall young fellow, yourself, my friend, scarcely more than a lad then, carrying papers. The rest stood to right and left in a formal line. _You_ gave a printed document to Mr. Osborn who put on his glasses and began to read in a low voice which few could hear, and I noticed that his hand trembled. Presently he grew confused, lost his place, found it, lost it again and came to a full stop.\n\n\u201cA nervous-natured man,\u201d remarked Mr. Anscombe. \u201cPerhaps he thinks that those gentlemen are going to shoot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t trouble him,\u201d I answered, who knew him well. \u201cHis fears are purely mental.\u201d\n\nThat was true since I know that this same Sir Melmoth Osborn as he is now, as I have told in the book I called _Child of Storm_, swam the Tugela alone to watch the battle of Indondakasuka raging round him, and on another occasion killed two Kaffirs rushing at him with a right and left shot without turning a hair. It was reading this paper that paralyzed him, not any fear of what might happen.\n\nThere followed a very awkward pause such as occurs when a man breaks down in a speech. The members of the Staff looked at him and at each other, then behold! you, my friend, grabbed the paper from his hand and went on reading it in a loud clear voice.\n\n\u201cThat young man has plenty of nerve,\u201d said Mr. Anscombe.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I replied in a whisper. \u201cQuite right though. Would have been a bad omen if the thing had come to a stop.\u201d\n\nWell, there were no more breakdowns, and at last the long document was finished and the Transvaal annexed. The Britishers began to cheer but stopped to listen to the formal protest of the Boer Government, if it could be called a government when everything had collapsed and the officials were being paid in postage stamps. I can\u2019t remember whether this was read by President Burgers himself or by the officer who was called State Secretary. Anyway, it was read, after which there came an awkward pause as though people were waiting to see something happen. I looked round at the Boers who were muttering and handling their rifles uneasily. Had they found a leader I really think that some of the wilder spirits among them would have begun to shoot, but none appeared and the crisis passed.\n\n\nThe crowd began to disperse, the English among them cheering and throwing up their hats, the Dutch with very sullen faces. The Commissioner\u2019s staff went away as it had come, back to the building with blue gums in front of it, which afterwards became Government House, that is all except you. You started across the square alone with a bundle of printed proclamations in your hand which evidently you had been charged to leave at the various public offices.\n\n\u201cLet us follow him,\u201d I said to Mr. Anscombe. \u201cHe might get into trouble and want a friend.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and we strolled after you unostentatiously. Sure enough you nearly did get into trouble. In front of the first office door to which you came, stood a group of Boers, two of whom, big fellows, drew together with the evident intention of barring your way.\n\n\u201cMynheeren,\u201d you said, \u201cI pray you to let me pass on the Queen\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nThey took no heed except to draw closer together and laugh insolently. Again you made your request and again they laughed. Then I saw you lift your leg and deliberately stamp upon the foot of one of the Boers. He drew back with an exclamation, and for a moment I believed that he or his fellow was going to do something violent. Perhaps they thought better of it, or perhaps they saw us two Englishmen behind and noticed Anscombe\u2019s pistol. At any rate you marched into the office triumphant and delivered your document.\n\n\u201cNeatly done,\u201d said Mr. Anscombe.\n\n\u201cRash,\u201d I said, shaking my head, \u201cvery rash. Well, he\u2019s young and must be excused.\u201d\n\nBut from that moment I took a great liking to you, my friend, perhaps because I wondered whether in your place I should have been daredevil enough to act in the same way. For you see I am English, and I like to see an Englishman hold his own against odds and keep up the credit of the country. Although, of course, I sympathized with the Boers who, through their own fault, were losing their land without a blow struck. As you know well, for you were living near Majuba at the time, plenty of blows were struck afterwards, but of that business I cannot bear to write. I wonder how it will all work out after I am dead and if I shall ever learn what happens in the end.\n\n\nNow I have only mentioned this business of the Annexation and the part you played in it, because it was on that occasion that I became acquainted with Anscombe. For you have nothing to do with this story which is about the destruction of the Zulus, the accomplishment of the vengeance of Zikali the wizard at the kraal named Finished, and incidentally, the love affairs of two people in which that old wizard took a hand, as I did to my sorrow.\n\nIt happened that Mr. Anscombe had ridden on ahead of his wagons which could not arrive at Pretoria for a day or two, and as he found it impossible to get accommodation at the _European_ or elsewhere, I offered to let him sleep in mine, or rather alongside in a tent I had. He accepted and soon we became very good friends. Before the day was out I discovered that he had served in a crack cavalry regiment, but resigned his commission some years before. I asked him why.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI came into a good lot of money on my mother\u2019s death and could not see a prospect of any active service. While the regiment was abroad I liked the life well enough, but at home it bored me. Too much society for my taste, and that sort of thing. Also I wanted to travel; nothing else really amuses me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will soon get tired of it,\u201d I answered, \u201cand as you are well off, marry some fine lady and settle down at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think so. I doubt if I should ever be happily married, I want too much. One doesn\u2019t pick up an earthly angel with a cast-iron constitution who adores you, which are the bare necessities of marriage, under every bush.\u201d Here I laughed. \u201cAlso,\u201d he added, the laughter going out of his eyes, \u201cI have had enough of fine ladies and their ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarriage is better than scrapes,\u201d I remarked sententiously.\n\n\u201cQuite so, but one might get them both together. No, I shall never marry, although I suppose I ought as my brothers have no children.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you, my friend,\u201d thought I to myself, \u201cwhen the skin grows again on your burnt fingers.\u201d\n\nFor I was sure they had been burnt, perhaps more than once. How, I never learned, for which I am rather sorry for it interests me to study burnt fingers, if they do not happen to be my own. Then we changed the subject.\n\nAnscombe\u2019s wagons were delayed for a day or two by a broken axle or a bog hole, I forget which. So, as I had nothing particular to do until the Natal post-cart left, we spent the time in wandering about Pretoria, which did not take us long as it was but a little dorp in those days, and chatting with all and sundry. Also we went up to Government House as it was now called, and left cards, or rather wrote our names in a book for we had no cards, being told by one of the Staff whom we met that we should do so. An hour later a note arrived asking us both to dinner that night and telling us very nicely not to mind if we had no dress things. Of course we had to go, Anscombe rigged up in my second best clothes that did not fit him in the least, as he was a much taller man than I am, and a black satin bow that he had bought at Becket\u2019s Store together with a pair of shiny pumps.",
    "Riding through the scattered thorns and following the spoor where I could, within half an hour we came to a little glade. There, not fifty yards away, I caught sight of a single blue wildebeeste bull standing in the shadow of the trees on the further side of the glade, and pointed out the ugly beast, for it is the most grotesque of all the antelopes, to Anscombe.\n\n\u201cOff you get,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely shot, you can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, can\u2019t I!\u201d replied Anscombe. \u201cDo you shoot.\u201d\n\nI refused, so he dismounted, giving me his horse to hold, and kneeling down solemnly and slowly covered the bull. Bang went his rifle, and I saw a bough about a yard above the wildebeeste fall on to its back. Off it went like lightning, whereon Anscombe let drive with the left barrel of the Express, almost at hazard as it seemed to me, and by some chance hit it above the near fore-knee, breaking its leg.\n\n\u201cThat was a good shot,\u201d he cried, jumping on to his horse.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut what are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cCatch it. It is cruel to leave a wounded animal,\u201d and off he started.\n\n\nOf course I had to follow, but the ensuing ride remains among the more painful of my hunting memories. We tore through thorn trees that scratched my face and damaged my clothes; we struck a patch of antbear holes, into one of which my horse fell so that my stomach bumped against its head; we slithered down granite koppies, and this was the worst of it, at the end of each chapter, so to speak, always caught sight of that accursed bull which I fondly hoped would have vanished into space. At length after half an hour or so of this game we reached a stretch of open, rolling ground, and there not fifty yards ahead of us was the animal still going like a hare, though how it could do so on three legs I am sure I do not know. We coursed it like greyhounds, till at last Anscombe, whose horse was the faster, came alongside of the exhausted creature, whereon it turned suddenly and charged.\n\nAnscombe held out his rifle in his right hand and pulled the trigger, which, as he had forgotten to reload it, was a mere theatrical performance. Next second there was such a mix-up that for a while I could not distinguish which was Anscombe, which was the wildebeeste, and which the horse. They all seemed to be going round and round in a cloud of dust. When things settled themselves a little I discovered the horse rolling on the ground, Anscombe on his back with his hands up in an attitude of prayer and the wildebeeste trying to make up its mind which of them it should finish first. I settled the poor thing\u2019s doubts by shooting it through the heart, which I flatter myself was rather clever of me under the circumstances. Then I dismounted to examine Anscombe, who, I presumed, was done for. Not a bit of it. There he sat upon the ground blowing like a blacksmith\u2019s bellows and panting out\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat a glorious gallop. I finished it very well, didn\u2019t I? You couldn\u2019t have made a better shot yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, \u201cyou finished it very well as you will find out if you will take the trouble to open your rifle and count your cartridges. I may add that if we are going to hunt together I hope you will never lead me such a fool\u2019s chase again.\u201d\n\nHe rose, opened the rifle and saw that it was empty, for although he had never re-loaded he had thrown out the two cartridges which he had discharged in the glen.\n\n\u201cBy Jingo,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must have shot it, though I could have sworn that it was I. Quatermain, has it ever struck you what a strange thing is the human imagination?\u201d\n\n\u201cDrat the human imagination,\u201d I answered, wiping away the blood that was trickling into my eye from a thorn scratch. \u201cLet\u2019s look at your horse. If it is lamed you will have to ride Imagination back to the wagon which must be six miles away, that is if we can find it before dark.\u201d\n\nSighing out something about a painfully practical mind, he obeyed, and when the beast was proved to be nothing more than blown and a little bruised, made remarks as to the inadvisability of dwelling on future evil events, which I reminded him had already been better summed up in the New Testament.\n\n\nAfter this we contemplated the carcase of the wildebeeste which it seemed a pity to leave to rot. Just then Anscombe, who had moved a few yards to the right out of the shadow of an obstructing tree, exclaimed\u2014\n\n\u201cI say, Quatermain, come here and tell me if I have been knocked silly, or if I really see a quite uncommon kind of house built in ancient Greek style set in a divine landscape.\u201d\n\n\u201cTemple to Diana, I expect,\u201d I remarked as I joined him on the further side of the tree.\n\nI looked and rubbed my eyes. There, about half a mile away, situated in a bay of the sweeping hills and overlooking the measureless expanse of bush-veld beneath, was a remarkable house, at least for those days and that part of Africa. To begin with the situation was superb. It stood on a green and swelling mound behind which was a wooded kloof where ran a stream that at last precipitated itself in a waterfall over a great cliff. Then in front was that glorious view of the bush-veld, at which a man might look for a lifetime and not grow tired, stretching away to the Oliphant\u2019s river and melting at last into the dim line of the horizon.\n\n\nThe house itself also, although not large, was of a kind new to me. It was deep, but narrow fronted, and before it were four columns that carried the roof which projected so as to form a wide verandah. Moreover it seemed to be built of marble which glistened like snow in the setting sun. In short in that lonely wilderness, at any rate from this distance, it did look like the deserted shrine of some forgotten god.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m bothered!\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d answered Anscombe, \u201cto know the name of the Lydenburg district architect whom I should like to employ; though I suspect it is the surroundings that make the place look so beautiful. Hullo! here comes somebody, but he doesn\u2019t look like an architect; he looks like a wicked baronet disguised as a Boer.\u201d\n\nTrue enough, round a clump of bush appeared an unusual looking person, mounted on a very good horse. He was tall, thin and old, at least he had a long white beard which suggested age, although his figure, so far as it could be seen beneath his rough clothes, seemed vigorous. His face was clean cut and handsome, with a rather hooked nose, and his eyes were grey, but as I saw when he came up to us, somewhat bloodshot at the corners. His general aspect was refined and benevolent, and as soon as he opened his mouth I perceived that he was a person of gentle breeding.\n\n\nAnd yet there was something about him, something in his atmosphere, so to speak, that I did not like. Before we parted that evening I felt sure that in one way or another he was a wrong-doer, not straight; also that he had a violent temper.\n\nHe rode up to us and asked in a pleasant voice, although the manner of his question, which was put in bad Dutch, was not pleasant,\n\n\u201cWho gave you leave to shoot on our land?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not know that any leave was required; it is not customary in these parts,\u201d I answered politely in English. \u201cMoreover, this buck was wounded miles away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d he exclaimed in the same tongue, \u201cthat makes a difference, though I expect it was still on our land, for we have a lot; it is cheap about here.\u201d Then after studying a little, he added apologetically, \u201cYou mustn\u2019t think me strange, but the fact is my daughter hates things to be killed near the house, which is why there\u2019s so much game about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen pray make her our apologies,\u201d said Anscombe, \u201cand say that it shall not happen again.\u201d\n\nHe stroked his long beard and looked at us, for by now he had dismounted, then said\u2014\n\n\u201cMight I ask you gentlemen your names?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d I replied. \u201cI am Allan Quatermain and my friend is the Hon. Maurice Anscombe.\u201d\n\nHe started and said\u2014\n\n\u201cOf Allan Quatermain of course I have heard. The natives told me that you were trekking to those parts; and if you, sir, are one of Lord Mountford\u2019s sons, oddly enough I think I must have known your father in my youth. Indeed I served with him in the Guards.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow very strange,\u201d said Anscombe. \u201cHe\u2019s dead now and my brother is Lord Mountford. Do you like life here better than that in the Guards? I am sure I should.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth of them have their advantages,\u201d he answered evasively, \u201cof which, if, as I think, you are also a soldier, you can judge for yourself. But won\u2019t you come up to the house? My daughter Heda is away, and my partner Mr. Rodd\u201d (as he mentioned this name I saw a blue vein, which showed above his cheek bone, swell as though under pressure of some secret emotion) \u201cis a retiring sort of a man\u2014indeed some might think him sulky until they came to know him. Still, we can make you comfortable and even give you a decent bottle of wine.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you very much,\u201d I answered, \u201cwe must get back to the wagon or our servants will think that we have come to grief. Perhaps you will accept the wildebeeste if it is of any use to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said in a voice that suggested regret struggling with relief. To the buck he made no allusion, perhaps because he considered that it was already his own property. \u201cDo you know your way? I believe your wagon is camped out there to the east by what we call the Granite stream. If you follow this Kaffir path,\u201d and he pointed to a track near by, \u201cit will take you quite close.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere does the path run to?\u201d I asked. \u201cThere are no kraals about, are there?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! to the Temple, as my daughter calls our house. My partner and I are labour agents, we recruit natives for the Kimberley Mines,\u201d he said in explanation, adding, \u201cWhere do you propose to shoot?\u201d\n\nI told him.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that rather a risky district?\u201d he said. \u201cI think that Sekukuni will soon be giving more trouble, although there is a truce between him and the English. Still he might send a regiment to raid that way.\u201d\n\nI wondered how our friend knew so much of Sekukuni\u2019s possible intentions, but only answered that I was accustomed to deal with natives and did not fear them.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d he said, \u201cwell, you know your own business best. But if you should get into any difficulty, make straight for this place. The Basutos will not interfere with you here.\u201d\n\nAgain I wondered why the Basutos should look upon this particular spot as sacred, but thinking it wisest to ask no questions, I only answered\u2014\n\n\u201cThank you very much. We\u2019ll bear your invitation in mind, Mr.\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMarnham.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarnham,\u201d I repeated after him. \u201cGood-bye and many thanks for your kindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne question,\u201d broke in Anscombe, \u201cif you will not think me rude. What is the name of the architect who designed that most romantic-looking house of yours which seems to be built of marble?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy daughter designed it, or at least I think she copied it from some old drawing of a ruin. Also it _is_ marble; there\u2019s a whole hill of the stuff not a hundred yards from the door, so it was cheaper to use than anything else. I hope you will come and see it on your way back, though it is not as fine as it appears from a distance. It would be very pleasant after all these years to talk to an English gentleman again.\u201d\n\nThen we parted, I rather offended because he did not seem to include me in the description, he calling after us\u2014\n\n\u201cStick close to the path through the patch of big trees, for the ground is rather swampy there and it\u2019s getting dark.\u201d",
    "It was in this mood of utter dejection that we agreed to play a game of cards one evening. Not that either of us cared for cards; indeed, personally, I have always detested them because, with various-coloured counters to represent money which never passed, they had formed one of the afflictions of my youth.\n\nIt was so annoying if you won, to be handed a number of green counters and be informed that they represented so many hundreds or thousands of pounds, or vice-versa if you lost, for as it cost no one anything, my dear father insisted upon playing for enormous stakes. Never in any aspect of life have I cared for fooling. Anscombe also disliked cards, I think because his ancestors too had played with counters, such as some that I have seen belonging to the Cocoa-Tree Club and other gambling places of a past generation, marked as high as a thousand guineas, which counters must next morning be redeemed in hard cash, whereby his family had been not a little impoverished.\n\n\u201cI fancy you will find they are high-fliers,\u201d he said when the pair had left to fetch a suitable table, for the night being very hot we were going to play on the stoep by the light of the hanging paraffin lamp and some candles. I replied to the effect that I could not afford to lose large sums of money, especially to men who for aught I knew might then be engaged in marking the cards.\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he answered. \u201cDon\u2019t you bother about that, old fellow. This is my affair, arranged for my special amusement. I shan\u2019t grumble if the fun costs something, for I am sure there will be fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, \u201conly if we should happen to win money, it\u2019s yours, not mine.\u201d\n\nTo myself I reflected, however, that with these two opponents we had about as much chance of winning as a snowflake has of resisting the atmosphere of the lower regions.\n\n\nPresently they returned with the table, which had a green cloth over it that hung down half-way to the ground. Also one of the native boys brought a tray with spirits, from which I judged by various signs, old Marnham, who had already drunk his share at dinner, had helped himself freely on the way. Soon we were arranged, Anscombe, who was to be my partner, opposite to me in his long chair, and the game began.\n\nI forget what particular variant of cards it was we played, though I know it admitted of high and progressive stakes. At first, however, these were quite moderate and we won, as I suppose we were meant to do. After half an hour or so Marnham rose to help himself to brandy and water, a great deal of brandy and very little water, while I took a nip of Hollands, and Anscombe and Rodd filled their pipes.\n\n\u201cI think this is getting rather slow,\u201d said Rodd to Anscombe. \u201cI vote we put a bit more on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs much as you like,\u201d answered Anscombe with a little drawl and twinkle of the eye, which always showed that he was amused. \u201cBoth Quatermain and I are born gamblers. Don\u2019t look angry, Quatermain, you know you are. Only if we lose you will have to take a cheque, for I have precious little cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that will be good enough,\u201d replied the doctor quietly\u2014\u201cif you lose.\u201d\n\nSo the stakes were increased to an amount that made my hair stand up stiffer even than usual, and the game went on. Behold! a marvel came to pass. How it happened I do not know, unless Marnham had brought the wrong cards by mistake or had grown too fuddled to understand his partner\u2019s telegraphic signals, which I, being accustomed to observe, saw him make, not once but often, still we won! What is more, with a few set-backs, we went on winning, till presently the sums written down to our credit, for no actual cash passed, were considerable. And all the while, at the end of each bout Marnham helped himself to more brandy, while the doctor grew more mad in a suppressed-thunder kind of a way. For my part I became alarmed, especially as I perceived that Anscombe was on the verge of breaking into open merriment, and his legs being up I could not kick him under the table.\n\n\u201cMy partner ought to go to bed. Don\u2019t you think we should stop?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOn the whole I do,\u201d replied Rodd, glowering at Marnham, who, somewhat unsteadily, was engaged in wiping drops of brandy from his long beard.\n\n\u201cD\u2014\u2014d if I do,\u201d exclaimed that worthy. \u201cWhen I was young and played with gentlemen they always gave losers an opportunity of revenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d replied Anscombe with a flash of his eyes, \u201clet us try to follow in the footsteps of the gentlemen with whom you played in your youth. I suggest that we double the stakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s the old form!\u201d said Marnham.\n\n\nThe doctor half rose from his chair, then sat down again. Watching him, I concluded that he believed his partner, a seasoned vessel, was not so drunk as he pretended to be, and either in an actual or a figurative sense, had a card up his sleeve. If so, it remained there, for again we won; all the luck was with us.\n\n\u201cI am getting tired,\u201d drawled Anscombe. \u201cLemon and water are not sustaining. Shall we stop?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy Heaven! no,\u201d shouted Marnham, to which Anscombe replied that if it was wished, he would play another hand, but no more.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Marnham, \u201cbut let it be for double or quits.\u201d\n\nHe spoke quite quietly and seemed suddenly to have grown sober. Now I think that Rodd made up his mind that he really was acting and that he really had that card up his sleeve. At any rate he did not object. I, however, was of a different opinion, having often seen drunken men succumb to an access of sobriety under the stress of excitement and remarked that it did not last long.\n\n\u201cDo you really mean that?\u201d I said, speaking for the first time and addressing myself to the doctor. \u201cI don\u2019t quite know what the sum involved is, but it must be large.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he answered.\n\nThen remembering that at the worst Anscombe stood to lose nothing, I shrugged my shoulders and held my tongue. It was Marnham\u2019s deal, and although he was somewhat in the shadow of the hanging lamp and the candles had guttered out, I distinctly saw him play some hocus-pocus with the cards, but in the circumstances made no protest. As it chanced he must have hocus-pocused them wrong, for though _his_ hand was full of trumps, Rodd held nothing at all. The battle that ensued was quite exciting, but the end of it was that an ace in the hand of Anscombe, who really was quite a good player, did the business, and we won again.\n\n\nIn the rather awful silence that followed Anscombe remarked in his cheerful drawl\u2014\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that my addition is quite right; we\u2019ll check that in the morning, but I make out that you two gentlemen owe Quatermain and myself \u00a3749 10s.\u201d\n\nThen the doctor broke out.\n\n\u201cYou accursed old fool,\u201d he hissed\u2014there is no other word for it\u2014at Marnham. \u201cHow are you going to pay all this money that you have gambled away, drunken beast that you are!\u201d\n\n\u201cEasily enough, you felon,\u201d shouted Marnham. \u201cSo,\u201d and thrusting his hand into his pocket he pulled out a number of diamonds which he threw upon the table, adding, \u201cthere\u2019s what will cover it twice over, and there are more where they came from, as you know well enough, my medical jailbird.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dare to call me that,\u201d gasped the doctor in a voice laden with fury, so intense that it had deprived him of his reason, \u201cyou\u2014you\u2014murderer! Oh! why don\u2019t I kill you as I shall some day?\u201d and lifting his glass, which was half full, he threw the contents into Marnham\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice man for a prospective son-in-law, isn\u2019t he?\u201d exclaimed the old scamp, as, seizing the brandy decanter, he hurled it straight at Rodd\u2019s head, only missing him by an inch.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you had both better go to bed, gentlemen?\u201d I inquired. \u201cYou are saying things you might regret in the morning.\u201d\n\nApparently they did think it, for without another word they rose and marched off in different directions to their respective rooms, which I heard both of them lock. For my part I collected the I.O.U.\u2018s; also the diamonds which still lay upon the table, while Anscombe examined the cards.\n\n\u201cMarked, by Jove!\u201d he said. \u201cOh! my dear Quatermain, never have I had such an amusing evening in all my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, you silly idiot,\u201d I answered. \u201cThere\u2019ll be murder done over this business, and I only hope it won\u2019t be on us.\u201d",
    "That evening Rodd was absent from dinner, and on inquiring where he might be, I was informed that he had ridden to visit a Kaffir headman, a patient of his who lived at a distance, and would very probably sleep at the kraal, returning early next day. One of the topics of conversation during dinner was as to where the exact boundary line used to run between the Transvaal and the country over which the Basuto chief, Sekukuni, claimed ownership and jurisdiction. Marnham said that it passed within a couple of miles of his house, and when we rose, the moon being very bright, offered to show me where the beacons had been placed years before by a Boer Commission. I accepted, as the night was lovely for a stroll after the hot day. Also I was half conscious of another undefined purpose in my mind, which perhaps may have spread to that of Marnham. Those two young people looked very happy together there on the stoep, and as they must part so soon it would, I thought, be kind to give them the opportunity of a quiet chat.\n\nSo off we went to the brow of the hill on which the Temple stood, whence old Marnham pointed out to me a beacon, which I could not see in the dim, silvery bush-veld below, and how the line ran from it to another beacon somewhere else.\n\n\u201cYou know the Yellow-wood swamp,\u201d he said. \u201cIt passes straight through that. That is why those Basutos who were following you pulled up upon the edge of the swamp, though as a matter of fact, according to their ideas, they had a perfect right to kill you on their side of the line which cuts through the middle.\u201d\n\nI made some remark to the effect that I presumed that the line had in fact ceased to exist at all, as the Basuto territory had practically become British; after which we strolled back to the house. Walking quietly between the tall rose hedges and without speaking, for each of us was preoccupied with his own thoughts, suddenly we came upon a very pretty scene.\n\nWe had left Anscombe and Heda seated side by side on the stoep. They were still there, but much closer together. In fact his arms were round her, and they were kissing each other in a remarkably whole-hearted way. About this there could be no mistake, since the rimpi-strung couch on which they sat was immediately under the hanging lamp\u2014a somewhat unfortunate situation for such endearments. But what did they think of hanging lamps or any other lights, save those of their own eyes, they who were content to kiss and murmur words of passion as though they were as much alone as Adam and Eve in Eden? What did they think either of the serpent coiled about the bole of this tree of knowledge whereof they had just plucked the ripe and maddening fruit?\n\nBy a mutual instinct Marnham and I withdrew ourselves, very gently indeed, purposing to skirt round the house and enter it from behind, or to be seized with a fit of coughing at the gate, or to do something to announce our presence at a convenient distance. When we had gone a little way we heard a crash in the bushes.\n\n\u201cAnother of those cursed baboons robbing the garden,\u201d remarked Marnham reflectively.\n\n\u201cI think he is going to rob the house also,\u201d I replied, turning to point to something dark that seemed to be leaping up on to the verandah.\n\nNext moment we heard Heda utter a little cry of alarm, and a man say in a low fierce voice\u2014\u201cSo I have caught you at last, have I!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctor has returned from his business rounds sooner than was expected, and I think that we had better join the party,\u201d I remarked, and made a bee line for the stoep, Marnham following me.\n\nI think that I arrived just in time to prevent mischief. There, with a revolver in his hand, stood Rodd, tall and formidable, his dark face looking like that of Satan himself, a very monument of rage and jealousy. There in front of him on the couch sat Heda, grasping its edge with her fingers, her cheeks as pale as a sheet and her eyes shining. By her side was Anscombe, cool and collected as usual, I noticed, but evidently perplexed.\n\n\u201cIf there is any shooting to be done,\u201d he was saying, \u201cI think you had better begin with me.\u201d\n\nHis calmness seemed to exasperate Rodd, who lifted the revolver. But I too was prepared, for in that house I always went armed. There was no time to get at the man, who was perhaps fifteen feet away, and I did not want to hurt him. So I did the best I could; that is, I fired at the pistol in his hand, and the light being good, struck it near the hilt and knocked it off the barrel before he could press the trigger, if he really meant to shoot.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good shot,\u201d remarked Anscombe who had seen me, while Rodd stared at the hilt which he still held.\n\n\u201cA lucky one,\u201d I answered, walking forward. \u201cAnd now, Dr. Rodd, will you be so good as to tell me what you mean by flourishing a revolver, presumably loaded, in the faces of a lady and an unarmed man?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the devil is that to you,\u201d he asked furiously, \u201cand what do you mean by firing at me?\u201d\n\n\u201cA great deal,\u201d I answered, \u201cseeing that a young woman and my friend are concerned. As for firing at you, had I done so you would not be asking questions now. I fired at the pistol in your hand, but if there is more trouble next time it shall be at the holder,\u201d and I glanced at my revolver.\n\nSeeing that I meant business he made no reply, but turned upon Marnham who had followed me.\n\n\u201cThis is your work, you old villain,\u201d he said in a low voice that was heavy with hate. \u201cYou promised your daughter to me. She is engaged to me, and now I find her in this wanderer\u2019s arms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have I to do with it?\u201d said Marnham. \u201cPerhaps she has changed her mind. You had better ask her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no need to ask me,\u201d interrupted Heda, who now seemed to have got her nerve again. \u201cI _have_ changed my mind. I never loved you, Dr. Rodd, and I will not marry you. I love Mr. Anscombe here, and as he has asked me to be his wife I mean to marry him.\u201d",
    "\u201cFollow me,\u201d I shouted and crossed the stream which was shallow between the little pools, then led the way up the stony slope. The four horses negotiated it very well and the Cape cart, being splendidly built, took no harm. At the top I looked back and saw that the Basutos were following us.\n\n\u201cFlog the horses!\u201d I cried to Anscombe, and off we went at a hand gallop along the native track, the cart swaying and bumping upon the rough veld. The sun was setting now, in half an hour it would be quite dark.\n\nCould we keep ahead of them for that half hour?\n\nThe sun sank in a blaze of glory. Looking back by the light of its last rays I saw a single native silhouetted against the red sky. He was standing on a mound that we had passed a mile or more behind us, doubtless waiting for his companions whom he had outrun. So they had not given up the chase. What was to be done? Once it was completely dark we could not go on. We should lose our way; the horses would get into ant-bear holes and break their legs. Perhaps we might become bogged in some hollow, therefore we must wait till the moon rose, which would not be for a couple of hours.\n\nMeanwhile those accursed Basutos would be following us even in the dark. This would hamper them, no doubt, but they would keep the path, with which they were probably familiar, beneath their feet, and what is more, the ground being soft with recent rain, they could feel the wheel spoor with their fingers. I looked about me. Just here another track started off in a nor\u2019-westerly direction from that which we were following. Perhaps it ran to Lydenburg; I do not know. To our left, not more than a hundred yards or so away, the higher veld came to an end and sloped in an easterly direction down to bush-land below.\n\nShould I take the westerly road which ran over a great plain? No, for then we might be seen for miles and cut off. Moreover, even if we escaped the natives, was it desirable we should plunge into civilization just now and tell all our story, as in that case we must do. Rodd\u2019s death was quite justified, but it had happened on Transvaal territory and would require a deal of explanation. Fortunately there was no witness of it, except ourselves. Yes, there was though\u2014the driver Footsack, if he had got away, which, being mounted, would seem probable, a man who, for my part, I would not trust for a moment. It would be an ugly thing to see Anscombe in the dock charged with murder and possibly myself, with Footsack giving evidence against us before a Boer jury who might be hard on Englishmen. Also there was the body with a bullet in it.\n\nSuddenly there came into my mind a recollection of the very vivid dream of Zikali which had visited me, and I reflected that in Zululand there would be little need to trouble about the death of Rodd. But Zululand was a long way off, and if we were to avoid the Transvaal, there was only one way of going there, namely through Swaziland. Well, among the Swazis we should be quite safe from the Basutos, since the two peoples were at fierce enmity. Moreover I knew the Swazi chiefs and king very well, having traded there, and could explain that I came to collect debts owing to me.\n\nThere was another difficulty. I had heard that the trouble between the English Government and Cetewayo, the Zulu king, was coming to a head, and that the High Commissioner, Sir Bartle Frere, talked of presenting him with an ultimatum. It would be awkward if this arrived while we were in the country, though even so, being on such friendly terms with the Zulus of all classes, I did not think that I, or any with me, would run great risks.\n\nAll these thoughts rushed through my brain while I considered what to do. At the moment it was useless to ask the opinion of the others who were but children in native matters. I and I alone must take the responsibility and act, praying that I might do so aright. Another moment and I had made up my mind.\n\nSigning to Anscombe to follow me, I rode about a hundred yards or more down the nor\u2019-westerly path. Then I turned sharply along a rather stony ridge of ground, the cart following me all the time, and came back across our own track, my object being of course to puzzle any Kaffirs who might spoor us. Now we were on the edge of the gentle slope that led down to the bush-veld. Over this I rode towards a deserted cattle kraal built of stones, in the rich soil of which grew sundry trees; doubtless one of those which had been abandoned when Mosilikatze swept all this country on his way north about the year 1838. The way to it was easy, since the surrounding stones had been collected to build the kraal generations before. As we passed over the edge of the slope in the gathering gloom, Heda cried\u2014\u201cLook!\u201d and pointed in the direction whence we came. Far away a sheet of flame shot upwards.\n\n\u201cThe house is burning,\u201d she exclaimed.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cit can be nothing else;\u201d adding to myself, \u201ca good job too, for now there will be no postmortem on old Marnham.\u201d\n\nWho fired the place I never learnt. It may have been the Basutos, or Marnham\u2019s body-servant, or Footsack, or a spark from the kitchen fire. At any rate it blazed merrily enough notwithstanding the marble walls, as a wood-lined and thatched building of course would do. On the whole I suspected the boy, who may very well have feared lest he should be accused of having had a hand in his master\u2019s death. At least it was gone, and watching the distant flames I bethought me that with it went all Heda\u2019s past. Twenty-four hours before her father was alive, the bondservant of Rodd and a criminal. Now he was ashes and Rodd was dead, while she and the man she loved were free, with all the world before them. I wished that I could have added that they were safe. Afterwards she told me that much the same ideas passed through her own mind.",
    "Down the Black Kloof we tramped, emerging on the sunlit plain beyond without meeting any one. A couple of miles further on we came to a small stream where Goza announced we would halt to eat. So we ate of cold toasted meat which one of the men produced from a basket he carried, unpalatable food but better than nothing. Just as we had finished I looked up and saw the soldier to whom my note had been given. He was leading my mare that had been saddled. On it were my large saddle-bags packed with my belongings, also my thick overcoat, mackintosh, waterbottle, and other articles down to a bag of tobacco, a spare pipe and a box of wax matches. Moreover, the man carried my double-barrelled Express rifle and a shot-gun that could be used for ball, together with two bags of cartridges. Practically nothing belonging to me had been forgotten.\n\nI asked him who had collected the things. He replied the doctress Nomb\u00e9 had done so and had brought him the horse saddled to carry them. He did not know who saddled the horse as he had seen no one but Nomb\u00e9 to whom he had given the writing which she hid away. In answer to further questions, he said that Nomb\u00e9 had sent me a message. It was\u2014\u201cI bid farewell to Macumazahn for a little while and wish him good fortune till we meet again. Let him not be afraid in the battle, for even if he is hurt it will not be to death, since those go with him whom he cannot see, and protect him with their shields. Say to Macumazahn that I, Nomb\u00e9, remember in the morning what I said in the night and that what seems to be quite lost is ofttimes found again. Wish him good fortune and tell him I am sorry that I had not time to cause his spare garments to be cleansed with water, but that I have been careful to find his little box with the white man\u2019s medicines.\u201d\n\nI could extract nothing more from this soldier, who was either very stupid, or chose to appear so; nor indeed did I dare to put direct questions about the cart and those who travelled in it.\n\nSoon we marched again, for Goza would not allow me to ride the horse, fearing that I should escape on it. Nor would he let me carry either of the guns lest I should make use of them. All day we travelled, reaching the Nongoma heights in the late afternoon. On this beautiful spot we found a kraal situated where afterwards a magistracy was built when we conquered the country, whence there is one of the finest views in Zululand. There was no one in the kraal except two old women who appeared to be deaf and dumb for all I could get out of them. These aged dames, however, or others who were hidden, had made ready for our arrival, since a calf lay skinned and prepared for cooking, and by it big gourds filled with Kaffir beer and \u201cmaas\u201d or curdled milk.\n\nIn due course we ate of these provisions, and after we had finished I gave Goza a stiff tot of brandy, of which Nomb\u00e9, or perhaps Anscombe, had thoughtfully sent a bottle with my other baggage. The strong liquor made the old fellow talkative and enabled me to get a good deal of information out of him. Thus I learned that certain demands, as to which he was rather vague, had been made upon Cetewayo by the English Government, and that the King was now considering whether he should accede to them or fight. The Great Council of the nation was summoned to attend at Ulundi within a few days, when the matter would be decided. Meanwhile all the regiments were being gathered, or, as we should say, mobilized; an army, said Goza, greater than any that Chaka had ever led.\n\nI asked him what I had to do with this business, that I, a peaceful traveller and an old friend of the Zulus, should be made prisoner and dragged off to Ulundi. He replied he did not know who was not in the council of the High Ones, but he thought that Cetewayo the king wished to see me because I was their friend, perhaps that he might send me as a messenger to the white people. I asked him how the king knew that I was in the country, to which he replied that Zikali had told him I was coming, he did not know how, whereon he, Goza, was sent at once to fetch me. I could get no more out of him.\n\nI wondered if it would be worth while to make him quite drunk and then attempt to escape on the horse, but gave up the idea. To begin with, his men were at hand and there was not enough brandy to make them all drunk. Also even if I succeeded in winning away here in the heart of Zululand, it would not help Anscombe or Heda and I should probably be cut off and killed before I could get out of the country. So I abandoned the plan and went to sleep instead.\n\nNext morning we left Nongoma early in the hope of reaching Ulundi that evening if the Ivuna and Black Umfolozi Rivers proved fordable. As it chanced, although they were high, we were able to cross them, I seated on the horse which two of the Zulus led. Next we tramped for miles through the terrible Bekameezi Valley, a hot and desolate place which the Zulus swear is haunted. So unhealthy is this valley, which is the home of large game, that whole kraals full of people who have tried to cultivate the rich land, have died in it of fever, or fled away leaving their crops unreaped. Now no man dwells there. After this we climbed a terrible mount to the high land of Mahlabatini, and having eaten, pushed on once more.\n\nAt length we sighted the great hill-encircled plain of Ulundi which may be called the cradle of the Zulu race as, politically speaking, it was destined to be its coffin. On the ridge to the west once stood the Nobamba kraal where dwelt Senzangacona, the father of Chaka the Lion. Nearer to the White Umfolozi was Panda\u2019s dwelling-place, Nodwengu, which once I knew so well, while on the slope of the hills of the north-east stood the town of Ulundi in which Cetewayo dwelt, bathed in the lights of sunset.\n\nIndeed it and all the vast plain were red as though with blood, red as they were destined to be on the coming day of the last battle of the Zulus.",
    "\u201cRise, dog,\u201d said Cetewayo, and the man rose trembling with fear, and, being bidden, gave his name, which I forget.\n\n\u201cListen, dog,\u201d went on the king in the same cold voice. \u201cWhat Goza says is true, for I saw and heard it all with my eyes and ears. You would have made yourself as the king. You dared to try to kill the king\u2019s guest to whom he had given safe-conduct, and to stain the king\u2019s doorposts with his blood, thereby defiling his house and showing him to the white people as a murderer of one of them whom he had promised to protect. Macumazahn, do _you_ say how he shall die, and I will have it done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not wish him to die,\u201d I answered, \u201cI think that he and those with him were drunk. Let him go, O King.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, Macumazahn, I will let him go. See now, we are in the centre of the cattle-kraal, and to the eastern gate is as far as to the isigodhlo. Let this man have a start of ten spears\u2019 length and run to the eastern gate, as he would have made Macumazahn run to the king\u2019s house, and let his companions, those who would have hunted Macumazahn, hunt him.\n\nIf he wins through to the gate he can go on to the Government in Natal and tell them of the cruelty of the Zulus. Only then, let those who hunted him be brought before me for trial and perhaps we shall see how _they_ can run.\u201d\n\nNow the poor wretch caught hold of my hand, begging me to intercede for him, but soldiers who had come up dragged him away and, having measured the distance allowed him, set him on a mark made upon the ground. Presently at a word off he sped like an arrow, and after him went his friends, ten or more of them. I think they caught him just by the gate doubling like a hare, or so the shouts of laughter from the watching regiment told me, for myself I would not look.\n\n\u201cThat dog ate his own stomach,\u201d said Cetewayo grimly, thereby indicating in native fashion that the biter had been bit or the engineer hoist with his petard. \u201cIt is long since there has been a war in the land, and some of these young soldiers who have never used an assegai save to skin an ox or cut the head from a chicken, shout too loud and leap too high. Now they will be quieter, and while you stay here you may walk where you will in safety, Macumazahn,\u201d he added thoughtfully.\n\nThen dismissing the matter from his mind, as we white people dismiss any trivial incident in a morning stroll, he talked for a few minutes to the commanding officer of the regiment that was drilling, who ran up to make some report to him, and walked back towards the isigodhlo, beckoning me to follow with Goza.\n\n\nAfter waiting for a little while outside the gate in the surrounding fence, a body-servant ordered us to enter, which we did to find the king seated on the shady side of his big hut quite alone. At a sign I also sat myself down upon a stool that had been set for me, while Goza, whose nose was still bleeding, squatted at my side.\n\n\u201cYour manners are not so good as they were once, Macumazahn,\u201d said Cetewayo presently, \u201cor perhaps you have been so long away from the royal kraal that you have forgotten its customs.\u201d\n\nI stared at him, wondering what he could mean, whereon he added with a laugh\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat is that in your pocket? Is it not a loaded pistol, and do you not remember that it is death to appear before the king armed? Now I might kill you and have no blame, although you are my guest, for who knows that you are not sent by the English Queen to shoot me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask the King\u2019s pardon,\u201d I said humbly enough. \u201cI did not think about the pistol. Let your servants take it away.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps it is safer in your pocket, where I saw you place it in the cattle-kraal, Macumazahn, than in their hands, which do not know how to hold such things. Moreover, I know that you are not one who stabs in the dark, even when our peoples growl round each other like two dogs about to fight, and if you were, in this place your life would have to pay for mine. There is beer by your side; drink and fear nothing. Did you see the Opener of Roads, Goza, and if so, what is his answer to my message?\u201d\n\n\u201cO King, I saw him,\u201d answered Goza. \u201cThe Father of the doctors, the friend and master of the Spirits, says he has heard the King\u2019s word, yes, that he heard it as it passed the King\u2019s lips, and that although he is very old, he will travel to Ulundi and be present at the Great Council of the nation which is to be summoned on the eighth day from this, that of the full moon. Yet he makes a prayer of the King. It is that a place may be prepared for him, for his people and for his servants who carry him, away from this town of Ulundi, where he may sojourn quite alone, a decree of death being pronounced against any who attempt to break in upon his privacy, either where he dwells or upon his journey. These are his very words, O King:\n\n\u2018I, who am the most ancient man in Zululand, dwell with the spirits of my fathers, who will not suffer strangers to come nigh them and who, if they are offended, will bring great woes upon the land. Moreover, I have sworn that while there is a king in Zululand and I draw the breath of life, never again will I set foot in a royal kraal, because when last I did so at the slaying of the witch, Mameena, the king who is dead thought it well to utter threats against me, and never more will I, the Opener of Roads, be threatened by a mortal. Therefore if the King and his Council seek to drink of the water of my wisdom, it must be in the place and hour of my own choosing. If this cannot be, let me abide here in my house and let the King seek light from other doctors, since mine shall remain as a lamp to my own heart.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow I saw that these words greatly disturbed Cetewayo who feared Zikali, as indeed did all the land.\n\n\u201cWhat does the old wizard mean?\u201d he asked angrily. \u201cHe lives alone like a bat in a cave and for years has been seen of none. Yet as a bat flies forth at night, ranging far and wide in search of prey, so does his spirit seem to fly through Zululand. Everywhere I hear the same word. It is\u2014\u2018What says the Opener of Roads?\u2019 It is\u2014\u2018How can aught be done unless the Opener of Roads has declared that it shall be done, he who was here before the Black One (Chaka) was born, he who it is said was the friend of Inkosi Umkulu, the father of the Zulus who died before our great-grandfathers could remember; he who has all knowledge and is almost a spirit, if indeed he be not a spirit?\u2019 I ask you, Macumazahn, who are his friend, what does he mean, and why should I not kill him and be done?\u201d",
    "At length the silver radiance of the moon spread itself on the high curtain of the dark. Then the edge of her orb appeared above the hill and an arrow of white light fell into the little valley. It struck upon and about the jutting rock, revealing a misshapen, white-headed figure squatted between its base and the fire, the figure of Zikali.\n\nNone had seen or heard him come, and though doubtless he had but crept round the rock and taken his place in the darkness, there appeared to be something mysterious about this sudden appearance of Zikali. So the Zulu nobles thought at any rate, for they uttered a low \u201cOw!\u201d of fear and wonder.\n\nThere he sat like a huge ape staring at the sky, for the firelight shone on his deep and burning eyes. The moonlight increased, but now and again it was broken by little clouds which caused strange shadows to appear about the rock. Some of these shadows looked as though veiled figures were approaching the wizard, bending over him and departing again, after giving him their message or counsel.\n\n\u201cHis Spirits visit him,\u201d whispered Goza, but I made no answer.\n\nThis went on for quite a long time, until the full round of the moon appeared above the hill indeed, and, for the while, the clouds had cleared away. Still Zikali sat silent and I, who was acquainted with the habits of this people, knew that I was witnessing a conflict between two they considered to be respectively a spiritual and an earthly king. It is my belief that unless he were first addressed, Zikali would have sat all night without opening his lips. Possibly Cetewayo would have done the same if the impatience of public opinion had allowed him. At any was rate it was he who gave way.\n\n\u201c_Makosi_, master of many Spirits, on behalf of the Council and the People of the Zulus I, the King, greet you here in the place that you have chosen,\u201d said Cetewayo.\n\nZikali made no answer.\n\nThe silence went on as before, till at length, after a pause and some whispering, Cetewayo repeated his salutation, adding\u2014\n\n\u201cHas age made you deaf, O Opener of Roads, that you cannot hear the voice of the King?\u201d\n\nThen at last Zikali answered in his low voice that yet seemed to fill all the kloof\u2014\n\n\u201cNay, Child of Senzangacona, age has not made me deaf, but my spirit in these latter days floats far from my body. It is like a bladder filled with air that a child holds by a string, and before I can speak I must draw it from the heavens to earth again. What did you say about the place that I have chosen? Well, what better place could I choose, seeing that it was here in this very Vale of Bones that I met the first king of the Zulus, Chaka the Wild Beast, who was your uncle? Why then should I not choose it to meet the last king of the Zulus?\u201d\n\nNow I, listening, knew at once that this saying might be understood in two ways, namely that Cetewayo was the reigning king, or that he was the last king who would ever reign. But the Council interpreted it in the latter and worse sense, for I saw a quiver of fear go through them.\n\n\u201cWhy should I not choose it,\u201d went on Zikali, \u201cseeing also that this place is holy to me? Here it was, O Son of Panda, that Chaka brought my children to be killed and forced me, sitting where you sit, to watch their deaths. There on the rock above me they were killed, four of them, three sons and a daughter, and the slayers\u2014they came to an evil end, those slayers, as did Chaka\u2014laughed and cast them down from the rock before me. Yes, and Chaka laughed, and I too laughed, for had not the king the right to kill my children and to steal their mothers, and was I not glad that they should be taken from the world and gathered to that of Spirits whence they always talk to me, yes, even now? That is why I did not hear you at first, King, because they were talking to me.\u201d\n\nHe paused, turning one ear upwards, then continued in a new and tender voice, \u201cWhat is it you say to me, Noma, my dear little Noma? Oh! I hear you, I hear you.\u201d\n\nNow he shifted himself along the ground on his haunches some paces to the right, and began to search about, groping with his long fingers.\n\u201cWhere, where?\u201d he muttered. \u201cOh, I understand, further under the root, a jackal buried it, did it? Pah! how hard is this soil. Ah! I have it, but look, Noma, a stone has cut my finger. I have it, I have it,\u201d and from beneath the root of some fallen tree he drew out the skull of a child and, holding it in his right hand, softly rubbed the mould off it with his left.\n\n\u201cYes, Noma, it might be yours, it is of the right size, but how can I be sure? What is it you say? The teeth? Ah! now I remember. Only the day before you were taken I pulled out that front tooth, did I not, and beneath it was another that was strangely split in two. If this skull was yours, it will be there. Come to the fire, Noma, and let us look; the moonlight is faint, is it not?\u201d\n\nBack to the fire he shifted himself, and bending towards the blaze, made an examination.\n\n\u201cTrue, Noma, true! Here is the split tooth, white as when I saw it all those years ago. Oh! dear child of my body, dear child of my spirit, for we do not beget with the body alone, Noma, as you know better than I do to-day, I greet you,\u201d and pressing the skull to his lips, he kissed it, then set it down in front of him between himself and the fire with the face part pointing to the king, and burst into one of his eerie and terrible laughs.\n\nA low moan went up from his audience, and I felt the skin of Goza, who had shrunk against me, break into a profuse sweat. Then suddenly Zikali\u2019s voice changed once more and became hard and businesslike, if I may call it so, similar to that of other professional doctors.\n\n\u201cYou have sent for me, O King, as those who went before you have sent when great things were about to happen. What is the matter on which you would speak to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know well, Opener of Roads,\u201d answered Cetewayo, rather shakily I thought. \u201cThe matter is one of peace or war. The English threaten me and my people and make great demands on me; amongst others that the army should be disbanded. I can set them all out if you will. If I refuse to do as they bid me, then within a few days they will invade Zululand; indeed their soldiers are already gathered at the drifts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not needful, King,\u201d answered Zikali, \u201csince I know what all know, neither more nor less. The winds whisper the demands of the white men, the birds sing them, the hyenas howl them at night. Let us see how the matter stands. When your father died Sompseu (Sir T. Shepstone), the great white chief, came from the English Government to name you king. This he could not do according to our law, since how can a stranger name the King of the Zulus? Therefore the Council of the Nation and the doctors\u2014I was not among them, King\u2014moved the spirit of Chaka the Lion into the body of Sompseu and made him as Chaka was and gave him power to name you to rule over the Zulus. So it came about that to the English Queen through the spirit of Chaka you swore certain things; that slaying for witchcraft should be abolished; that no man should die without fair and open trial, and other matters.\u201d\n\nHe paused a while, then went on, \u201cThese oaths you have broken, O King, as being of the blood you are and what you are, you must do.\u201d",
    "Now of course I did not see all of the terrible battle that followed and can only tell of that part of it in which I had a share. Colonel Durnford rode out about three and a half miles to the left front, I really don\u2019t quite know why, for already we were hearing firing on the top of the Nqutu Hills almost behind us, where Captain Shepstone was engaging the Zulus, or so I believe. Suddenly we met a trooper of the Natal Carabineers whose name was Whitelaw, who had been out scouting. He reported that an enormous _impi_ was just ahead of us seated in an _umkumbi_, or semi-circle, as is the fashion of the Zulus before they charge. At least some of them, he said, were so seated, but others were already advancing.\n\nPresently these appeared over the crest of the hill, ten thousand of them I should say, and amongst them I recognized the shields of the Nodwengu, the Dududu, the Nokenke and the Ingoba-makosi regiments. Now there was nothing to be done except retreat, for the _impi_ was attacking in earnest. The General Untshingwayo, together with Undabuko, Cetewayo\u2019s brother, and the chief Usibebu who commanded the scouts, had agreed not to fight this day for the reason I have given, because it was that of the new moon, but circumstances had forced their hand and the regiments could no longer be restrained. So to the number of twenty thousand or more, say one-third of the total Zulu army, they hurled themselves upon the little English force that, owing to lack of generalship, was scattered here and there over a wide front and had no fortified base upon which to withdraw.\n\nWe fell back to a donga which we held for a little while, and then as we saw that there we should presently be overwhelmed, withdrew gradually for another two miles or so, keeping off the Zulus by our fire. In so doing we came upon the remains of the rocket battery near the foot of the conical hill I have mentioned, which had been destroyed by some regiment that passed behind us in its rush on the camp. There lay all the soldiers dead, assegaied through and through, and I noticed that one young fellow who had been shot through the head, still held a rocket in his hands.\n\nNow somewhat behind and perhaps half a mile to the right of this hill a long, shallow donga runs across the Isandhlwana plain. This we gained, and being there reinforced by about fifty of the Natal Carabineers under Captain Bradstreet, held it for a long while, keeping off the Zulus by our terrible fire which cut down scores of them every time they attempted to advance. At this spot I alone killed from twelve to fifteen of them, for if the big bullet from my Express rifle struck a man, he did not live. Messengers were sent back to the camp for more ammunition, but none arrived, Heaven knows why. My own belief is that the reserve cartridges were packed away in boxes and could not be got at. At last our supply began to run short, so there was nothing to be done except retreat upon the camp which was perhaps half a mile behind us.\n\nTaking advantage of a pause in the Zulu advance which had lain down while waiting for reserves, Colonel Durnford ordered a retirement that was carried out very well. Up to that time we had lost only quite a few men, for the Zulu fire was wild and high and they had not been able to get at us with the assegai. As we rode towards the mount I observed that firing was going on in all directions, especially on the nek that connected it with the Nqutu range where Captain Shepstone and his mounted Basutos were wiped out while trying to hold back the Zulu right horn. The guns, too, were firing heavily and doing great execution.\n\nAfter this all grew confused. Colonel Durnford gave orders to certain officers who came up to him, Captain Essex was one and Lieutenant Cochrane another. Then his force made for their wagons to get more ammunition. I kept near to the Colonel and a while later found myself with him and a large, mixed body of men a little to the right of the nek which we had crossed in our advance from the river. Not long afterwards there was a cry of \u201cThe Zulus are getting round us!\u201d and looking to the left I saw them pouring in hundreds across the ridge that joins Isandhlwana Mountain to the Nqutu Range. Also they were advancing straight on to the camp.\n\nThen the rout began. Already the native auxiliaries were slipping away and now the others followed. Of course this battle was but a small affair, yet I think that few have been more terrible, at any rate in modern times. The aspect of those plumed and shielded Zulus as they charged, shouting their war-cries and waving their spears, was awesome. They were mown down in hundreds by the Martini fire, but still they came on, and I knew that the game was up. A maddened horde of fugitives, mostly natives, began to flow past us over the nek, making for what was afterwards called Fugitives\u2019 Drift, nine miles away, and with them went white soldiers, some mounted, some on foot. Mingled with all these people, following them, on either side of them, rushed Zulus, stabbing as they ran. Other groups of soldiers formed themselves into rough squares, on which the savage warriors broke like water on a rock. By degrees ammunition ran out; only the bayonet remained. Still the Zulus could not break those squares. So they took another counsel. Withdrawing a few paces beyond the reach of the bayonets, they overwhelmed the soldiers by throwing assegais, then rushed in and finished them.",
    "Now I hoped that I might escape, but it was not to be, since on every side numbers of them crept up Isandhlwana Mountain and hid behind rocks or among the tall grasses, evidently for purposes of observation. Moreover some captains arrived on the little plateau where was the cave in which the soldier had been killed, and camped there. At least at sundown they unrolled their mats and ate, though they lighted no fire.\n\nThe darkness fell and in it escape for me from that guarded place was impossible, since I could not see where to set my feet and one false step on the steep rock would have meant my death. From the direction of Rorke\u2019s Drift I could hear continuous firing; evidently some great fight was going on there, I wondered vaguely\u2014with what result. A little later also I heard the distant tramp of horses and the roll of gun wheels. The captains below heard it too and said one to another that it was the English soldiers returning, who had marched out of the camp at dawn. They debated one with another whether it would be possible to collect a force to fall upon them, but abandoned the idea because the regiments who had fought that day were now at a distance and too tired, and the others had rushed forward with orders to attack the white men on and beyond the river.\n\nSo they lay still and listened, and I too lay still and listened, for on that cloudy, moonless night I could see nothing. I heard smothered words of command. I heard the force halt because it could not travel further in the gloom. Then they lay down, the living among the dead, wondering doubtless if they themselves would not soon be dead, as of course must have happened had the Zulu generalship been better, for if even five thousand men had been available to attack at dawn not one of them could have escaped. But Providence ordained it otherwise. Some were taken and the others left.\n\nAbout an hour before daylight I heard them stirring again, and when its first gleams came all of them had vanished over the nek of slaughter, with what thoughts in their hearts, I wondered, and to what fate. The captains on the plateau beneath had gone also, and so had the circle of guards upon the slopes of the mount, for I saw these depart through the grey mist. As the light gathered, however, I observed bodies of men collecting on the nek, or rather on both neks, which made it impossible for me to do what I had hoped, and run to overtake the English troops. From these I was utterly cut off. Nor could I remain longer without food on my point of rock, especially as I was sure that soon some Zulus would climb there to use it as an outlook post. So while I was still more or less hidden by the mist and morning shadows, I climbed down it by the same road that I had climbed up, and thus reached the plain. Not a living man, white or black, was to be seen, only the dead, only the dead. I was the last Englishman to stand upon the plain of Isandhlwana for weeks or rather months to come.\n\nOf all my experiences this was, I think, the strangest, after that night of hell, to find myself alone upon this field of death, staring everywhere at the distorted faces which on the previous morn I had seen so full of life. Yet my physical needs asserted themselves. I was very hungry, who for twenty-four hours had eaten nothing, faint with hunger indeed. I passed a provision wagon that had been looted by the Zulus. Tins of bully beef lay about, also, among a wreck of broken glass, some bottles of Bass\u2019s beer which had escaped their notice. I found an assegai, cleaned it in the ground which it needed, and opening one of the tins, lay down in a tuft of grass by a dead man, or rather between him and some Zulus whom he had killed, and devoured its contents. Also I knocked the tops off a couple of the beer bottles and drank my fill. While I was doing this a large rough dog with a silver-mounted collar on its neck, I think of the sort that is called an Airedale terrier, came up to me whining. At first I thought it was an hyena, but discovering my mistake, threw it some bits of meat which it ate greedily. Doubtless it had belonged to some dead officer, though there was no name on the collar. The poor beast, which I named Lost, at once attached itself to me, and here I may say that I kept it till its death, which occurred of jaundice at Durban not long before I started on my journey to King Solomon\u2019s Mines. No man ever had a more faithful friend and companion.\n\nWhen I had eaten and drunk I looked about me, wondering what I should do. Fifty yards away I saw a stout Basuto pony still saddled and bridled, although the saddle was twisted out of its proper position, which was cropping the grass as well as it could with the bit in its mouth. Advancing gently I caught it without trouble, and led it back to the plundered wagon. Evidently from the marks upon the saddlery it had belonged to Captain Shepstone\u2019s force of mounted natives.\n\nHere I filled the large saddlebags made of buckskin with tins of beef, a couple more bottles of beer and a packet of _tandstickor_ matches which I was fortunate enough to find. Also I took the Martini rifle from a dead soldier, together with a score or so of cartridges that remained in his belt, for apparently he must have been killed rather early in the fight.\n\nThus equipped I mounted the pony and once more bethought me of escaping to Natal. A look towards the nek cured me of that idea, for coming over it I saw the plumed heads of a whole horde of warriors. Doubtless these were returning from the unsuccessful attack on Rorke\u2019s Drift, though of that I knew nothing at the time. So whistling to the dog I bore to the left for the Nqutu Hills, riding as fast as the rough ground would allow, and in half an hour was out of sight of that accursed plain.\n\nOne more thing too I did. On its confines I came across a group of dead Zulus who appeared to have been killed by a shell. Dismounting I took the headdress of one of them and put it on, for I forgot to say that I had lost my hat. It was made of a band of otterskin from which rose large tufts of the black feathers of the finch which the natives call _sakabula_. Also I tied his kilt of white oxtails about my middle, precautions to which I have little doubt I owe my life, since from a distance they made me look like a Kaffir mounted on a captured pony.\n\nThen I started on again, whither I knew not.",
    "\u201cWell, Mr. Quatermain,\u201d she said, \u201cnothing more happened that day which we spent with bursting hearts. Kaatje did not question us as to what the witch-doctor had said after she was sent away. Indeed I noticed that she was growing very stupid and drowsy, like a person who has been drugged, as I daresay she was, and would insist upon beginning to pack up the things in a foolish kind of way, muttering something about our trekking on the following day. The night passed as usual, Kaatje sleeping very heavily by my side and snoring so much\u201d (here I groaned sympathetically) \u201cthat I could get little rest. On the next morning after breakfast as the huts were very hot, Nomb\u00e9 suggested that we should sit under the shadow of the overhanging rock, just where we are now. Accordingly we went, and being tired out with all our troubles and bad nights, I fell into a doze, and so, I think, did Maurice, Nomb\u00e9 sitting near to us and singing all the while, a very queer kind of song.\n\nPresently, through my doze as it were, I saw Kaatje approaching. Nomb\u00e9 went to meet her, still singing, and taking her hand, led her to the cart, where they seemed to talk to the horses, which surprised me as there were no horses. Then she brought her round the cart and pointed to us, still singing. Now Kaatje began to weep and throw her hands about, while Nomb\u00e9 patted her on the shoulder. I tried to speak to her but could not. My tongue was tied, why I don\u2019t know, but I suppose because I was really asleep, and Maurice also was asleep and did not wake at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Anscombe, \u201cI remember nothing of all this business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a while Kaatje went away, still weeping, and then I fell asleep in earnest and did not wake until the sun was going down, when I roused Maurice and we both went back to the hut, where I found that Nomb\u00e9 had cooked our evening meal. I looked for Kaatje, but could not find her. Also in searching through my things I missed the bag of jewels. I called to Nomb\u00e9 and asked where Kaatje was, whereon she smiled and said that she had gone away, taking the bag with her. This pained me, for I had always found Kaatje quite honest\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich she is,\u201d I remarked, \u201cfor those jewels are now in a bank at Maritzburg.\u201d\n\nHeda nodded and went on, \u201cI am glad to hear it; indeed, remembering what Zikali had said, I never really suspected her of being a thief, but thought it was all part of some plan. After this things went on as before, except that Nomb\u00e9 took Kaatje\u2019s place and was with me day and night. Of Kaatje\u2019s disappearance she would say nothing. Zikali we did not see.\n\nOn the third evening after the vanishing of Kaatje, Nomb\u00e9 came and said that I must make ready for a journey, and while she spoke men arrived with a litter that had grass mats hung round it. Nomb\u00e9 brought out my long cape and put it over me, also a kind of veil of white stuff which she threw over my head, so as to hide my face. I think it was made out of one of our travelling mosquito nets. Then she said I must say good-bye to Maurice for a while. There was a scene as you may imagine. He grew angry and said that he would come with me, whereon armed men appeared, six of them, and pushed him away with the handles of their spears. In another minute I was lifted into the litter which Nomb\u00e9 entered with me, and so we were parted, wondering if we should ever see each other more. At the mouth of the kloof I saw another litter surrounded by a number of Zulus, which Nomb\u00e9 said contained Zikali.\n\nWe travelled all that night and two succeeding nights, resting during the day in deserted kraals that appeared to have been made ready for us. It was a strange journey, for although the armed men flitted about us, neither they nor the bearers ever spoke, nor did I see Zikali, or indeed any one else. Only Nomb\u00e9 comforted me from time to time, telling me there was nothing to fear. Towards dawn on the third night we travelled over some hills and I was put into a new hut and told that my journey was done as we had reached a place near Ulundi.\n\nI slept most of the following day, but after I had eaten towards evening, Zikali crept into the hut, just as a great toad might do, and squatted down in front of me.\n\n\u2018Lady,\u2019 he said, \u2018listen. To-night, perhaps one hour after sundown, perhaps two, perhaps three, Nomb\u00e9 will lead you, dressed in a certain fashion, from this hut. See now, outside of it there is a tongue of rock up which you may climb unnoted by the little path that runs between those big stones. Look,\u2019 and he showed me the place through the door-hole. \u2018The path ends on a flat boulder at the end of the rock. There you will take your stand, holding in your right hand a little assegai which will be given to you. Nomb\u00e9 will not accompany you to the rock, but she will crouch between the stones at the head of the path and perhaps from time to time whisper to you what to do. Thus when she tells you, you must throw the little spear into the air, so that it falls among a number of men gathered in debate who will be seated about twenty paces from the rock. For the rest you are to stand quite still, saying nothing and showing no alarm whatever you may hear or see. Among the men before you may be your friend, Macumazahn, but you must not appear to recognize him, and if he speaks to you, you must make no answer. Even if he should seem to shoot at you, do not be afraid. Do you understand? If so, repeat what I have told you.\u2019 I obeyed him and asked what would happen if I did not do these things, or some of them.\n\nHe answered, \u2018You will be killed, Nomb\u00e9 will be killed, the lord Mauriti your lover will be killed, and your friend Macumazahn will be killed. Perhaps even I shall be killed and we will talk the matter over in the land of ghosts.\u2019\n\nOn hearing this I said I would do my best to carry out his orders, and after making me repeat them once more, he went away. Later, Nomb\u00e9 dressed me up as you saw me, Mr. Quatermain, put some glittering powder into my hair and touched me beneath the eyes with a dark kind of pigment. Also she gave me the little spear and made me practise standing quite still with it raised in my right hand, telling me that when I heard her say the word \u2018Throw,\u2019 I was to cast it into the air. Then the moon rose and we heard men talking at a distance. At last some one came to the hut and whispered to Nomb\u00e9, who led me out to the little path between the rocks.\n\n\u201cThis must have been nearly two hours after I heard the men begin to talk\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cbut where was Nomb\u00e9 all those two hours?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith me. She never left my side, Mr. Quatermain, and while I was on the rock she was crouched within three paces of me between two big stones at the mouth of the path.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d I replied faintly, \u201cthis is very interesting. Please continue\u2014but one word, how was Nomb\u00e9 dressed? Did she wear a necklace of blue beads?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as she always is, or rather less so, for she had nothing on except her moocha, and certainly no blue beads. But why do you ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom curiosity merely. I mean, I will tell you afterwards, pray go on.\u201d",
    "At length I made up my mind that I would go away, for after all what had I to do with this business of the death of Cetewayo, if in truth he was dying? I wished to see no more of Cetewayo of whom all my recollections were terrific or sorrowful. I rose to depart, when suddenly a woman emerged from the hut. I could not see who she was or even what she was like, because of the gloom; also for the reason that she had the corner of her blanket thrown over her face as though she wished to keep it hidden. For a moment she stopped opposite to me and said\u2014\n\n\u201cThe king who is sick desires to see you, Macumazahn.\u201d Then she pointed to the door-hole of the hut and vanished, shutting the gate of the fence behind her. Curiosity overcame me and I crawled into the hut, pushing aside the door-board in order to do so and setting it up again when I was through.\n\nInside burned a single candle fixed in the neck of a bottle, faintly illuminating that big and gloomy place. By its feeble light I saw a low bedstead on the left of the entrance and lying on it a man half covered by a blanket in whom I recognized Cetewayo. His face was shrunken and distorted with pain, and his great bulk seemed less, but still without doubt it was Cetewayo.\n\n\u201cGreeting, Macumazahn,\u201d he said feebly, \u201cyou find me in evil case, but I heard that you were here and thought that I should like to see you before I die, because I know that you are honest and will report my words faithfully. I wish you to tell the white men that my heart never really was against them; they have always been the friends of my heart, but others forced me down a road I did not wish to travel, of which now I have come to the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter with you, King?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI do not know, Macumazahn, but I have been sick for some days. The Opener of Roads who came to doctor me, because my wives believed those white medicine-men wished me dead, says that I have been poisoned and must die. If you had been here at first you might perhaps have given me some medicine. But now it is too late,\u201d he added with a groan.\n\n\u201cWho then poisoned you, King?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot tell you, Macumazahn. Perhaps my enemies, perhaps my brothers, perhaps my wives. All wish to have done with me, and the Great One, who is no longer wanted, is soon dead. Be thankful, Macumazahn, that you never were a king, for sad is the lot of kings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere, then, is the Opener of Roads?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHe was here a little while ago. Perhaps he has gone out to take the King\u2019s head\u201d (i.e., to announce his death) \u201cto Malimati and the white men,\u201d he answered in a faint voice.\n\nJust then I heard a shuffling noise proceeding from that part of the hut where the shadow was deepest, and looking, saw an emaciated arm projected into the circle of the light. It was followed by another arm, then by a vast head covered with long white hair that trailed upon the ground, then by a big, misshapen body, so wasted that it looked like a skeleton covered with corrugated black skin. Slowly, like a chameleon climbing a bough, the thing crept forward, and I knew it for Zikali. He reached the side of the bed and squatted down in his toad-like fashion, then, again like a chameleon, without moving his head turned his deep and glowing eyes towards me.\n\n\u201cHail, O Macumazahn,\u201d he said in his low voice. \u201cDid I not promise you long ago that you should be with me at the last, and are you not with me and another?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems so, Zikali,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut why do you not send for the white doctors to cure the king?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the doctors, white and black, in the whole world cannot cure him, Macumazahn. The Spirits call him and he dies. At his call I came fast and far, but even I cannot cure him\u2014although because of him I myself must die.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cLook at me, Macumazahn, and say if I am one who should travel. Well, all come to their end at last, even the 'Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born.\u2019\u201d\n\nCetewayo lifted his head and looked at him, then said heavily\u2014\n\n\u201cPerchance it would have been better for our House if that end had been sooner. Now that I lie dying many sayings concerning you come into my mind that I had forgotten. Moreover, Opener of Roads, I never sent for you, whoever may have done so, and it was not until after you came here that the great pain seized me. How did it happen,\u201d he went on with gathering force, \u201cthat the white men caught me in the secret place where you told me I should hide? Who pointed out that hidden hole to the white men? But what does it matter now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing at all, O Son of Panda,\u201d answered Zikali, \u201ceven less than it matters how I escaped the spear-head hidden in your robe, yonder in my hut in the Black Kloof where, had it not been for a certain spirit that stood between you and me, you would have murdered me. Tell me, Son of Panda, during these last three days have you thought at all of your brother Umbelazi, and of certain other brethren of yours whom you killed at the battle of the Tugela, when the white man here led the charge of the Amawombe against your regiments and ate up three of them?\u201d\n\nCetewayo groaned but said nothing. I think he had become too faint to speak."

  "Talbot Mundy -- The Ivory Trail": [
    "Estimates of ease and affluence vary with the point of view. While his older brother lived, Monty had continued in his element, a cavalry officer, his combined income and pay ample for all that the Bombay side of India might require of an English gentleman. They say that a finer polo player, a steadier shot on foot at a tiger, or a bolder squadron leader never lived.\n\nBut to Monty's infinite disgust his brother died childless. It is divulging no secret that the income that passed with the title varied between five and seven thousand pounds a year, according as coal was high, and tenants prosperous or not--a mere miserable pittance, of course, for the Earl of Montdidier and Kirkudbrightshire; so that all his ventures, and therefore ours, had one avowed end--shekels enough to lift the mortgages from his estates.\n\nFive generations of soldiers had blazed the Montdidier fame on battle-grounds, to a nation's (and why not the whole earth's) benefit, without replenishing the family funds, and Monty (himself a confirmed and convinced bachelor) was minded when his own time should come to pass the title along to the next in line together with sufficient funds to support its dignity.\n\nTo us--even to Yerkes, familiar with United States merchant kings--he seemed with his thirty thousand dollars a year already a gilded Croesus. He had ample to travel on, and finance prospecting trips. We never lacked for working capital, but the quest (and, including Yerkes, we were as keen as he) led us into strange places.\n\nSo behold him--a privy councilor of England if you please--lounging in the lazaretto of Zanzibar, clothed only in slippers, underwear and a long blue dressing-gown. We three others were dressed the same, and because it smacked of official restraint we objected noisily; but Monty did not seem to mind much. He was rather bored, but unresentful.\n\nA French steamer had put us ashore in quarantine, with the grim word cholera against us, and although our tale of suffering and Monty's rank, insured us a friendly reception, the port health authorities elected to be strict and we were given a nice long lazy time in which to cool our heels and order new clothes. (Guns, kit, tents, and all but what we stood in had gone to the bottom with the German cholera ship from whose life-boat the French had rescued us.)\n\n\"Keeping us all this time in this place, is sheer tyranny!\" grumbled Yerkes. \"If any one wants my opinion, they're afraid we'd talk if they let us out--more afraid of offending Germans than they are of cholera! Besides--any fool could know by now we're not sick!\"\n\n\"There might be something in that,\" admitted Monty.\n\n\"I'd send for the U. S. Consul and sing the song out loud, but for you!\" Yerkes added.\n\nMonty nodded sympathetically.\n\n\"Dashed good of you, Will, and all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"You English are so everlastingly afraid of seeming to start trouble, you'll swallow anything rather than talk!\"\n\n\"As a government, perhaps yes,\" admitted Monty. \"As a people, I fancy not. As a people we vary.\"\n\n\"You vary in that respect as much as sardines in a can! I traveled once all the way from London to Glasgow alone in one compartment with an Englishman. Talk? My, we were garrulous! I offered him a newspaper, cigarettes, matches, remarks on the weather suited to his brand of intelligence--(that's your sole national topic of talk between strangers!)--and all he ever said to me was 'Haw-ah!' I'll bet he was afraid of seeming to start trouble!\"\n\n\"He didn't start any, did he?\" asked Monty.\n\n\"Pretty nearly he did! I all but bashed him over the bean with the newspaper the third time he said 'haw-ah!'\"\n\nMonty laughed. Fred Oakes was busy across the room with his most amazing gift of tongues, splicing together half-a-dozen of them in order to talk with the old lazaretto attendant, so he heard nothing; otherwise there would have been argument.\n\n\"Then it would have been you, not he who started trouble,\" said I, and Yerkes threw both hands up in a gesture of despair.\n\n\"Even you're afraid of starting something!\" He stared at both of us with an almost startled expression, as if he could not believe his own verdict, yet could not get away from it. \"Else you'd give the Bundesrath story to the papers! That German skipper's conduct ought to be bruited round the world! You said you'd do it. You promised us! You told the man to his face you would!\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Monty, \"you've touched on another national habit.\"\n\n\"Which one?\" Yerkes demanded.\n\n\"Dislike of telling tales out of school. The man's dead. His ship's at the bottom. The tale's ended. What's the use? Besides--?\"\n\n\"Ah! You've another reason! Spill it!\"\n\n\"As a privy councilor, y'know, and all that sort of thing--?\"\n\n\"Same story! Afraid of starting something!\"\n\n\"The Germans--'specially their navy men--drink to what they call Der Tag y'know--the day when they shall dare try to tackle England. We all know that. They're planning war, twenty years from now perhaps, that shall give them all our colonies as well as India and Egypt. They're so keen on it they can't keep from bragging. Great Britain, on the other hand, hasn't the slightest intention of fighting if war can be avoided; so why do anything meanwhile to increase the tension? Why send broadcast a story that would only arouse international hatred? That's their method. Ours--I mean our government's--is to give hatred a chance to die down. If our papers got hold of the Bundesrath story they'd make a deuce of a noise, of course.\"",
    "\"Get on it? I am on it! Didn't One-eye say Tippoo Tib is alive and in Zanzibar? The old rascal! Many a slave he's done to death! Many a man he's tortured! I propose we catch Tippoo Tib, hide him, and pull out his toe-nails one by one until be blows the gaff!\"\n\n(To hear Fred talk when there is nothing to do but talk a stranger might arrive at many false conclusions.)\n\n\"If there's any truth in the story at all,\" said Monty, \"government will have done everything within the bounds of decency to coax the facts from Tippoo Tib. I suspect we'd have to take our chance and simply hunt. But let's hear Juma's story.\"\n\nSo the old attendant left off sprinkling water from a yellow jar, and came and stood before us. Fred's proposal of tweaking toe-nails would not have been practical in his case, for he had none left. His black legs, visible because he had tucked his one long garment up about his waist, were a mass of scars. He was lean, angular, yet peculiarly straight considering his years. As he stood before us he let his shirt-like garment drop, and the change from scarecrow to deferential servant was instantaneous. He was so wrinkled, and the wrinkles were so deep, that one scarcely noticed his sightless eye, almost hidden among a nest of creases; and in spite of the wrinkles, his polished, shaven head made him look ridiculously youthful because one expected gray hair and there was none.\n\n\"Ask him how he lost his toe-nails, Fred,\" said I.\n\nBut the old man knew enough English to answer for himself. He made a wry grimace and showed his hands. The finger-nails were gone too.\n\n\"Tell us your story, Juma,\" said Monty.\n\n\"Tell 'em about the pembe--the ivory--the much ivory--the meengi pembe,\" echoed Fred.\n\n\"Let's hear about those nails of his first,\" said I.\n\n\"One thing'll prob'ly lead to another,\" Yerkes agreed. \"Start him on the toe-nail story.\"\n\nBut it did not lead very far. Fred, who had picked up Kiswahili enough to piece out the old man's broken English, drew him out and clarified the tale. But it only went to prove that others besides ourselves had heard of Tippoo Tib's hoard. Some white man--we could not make head or tail of the name, but it sounded rather like Somebody belonging to a man named Carpets--had trapped him a few years before and put him to torture in the belief that he knew the secret.\n\n\"But me not knowing nothing!\" he assured us solemnly, shaking his head again and again.\n\nBut he was not in the least squeamish about telling us that Tippoo Tib had surely buried huge quantities of ivory, and had caused to be slain afterward every one who shared the secret.\n\n\"How long ago?\" asked Monty. But natives of that part of the earth are poor hands at reckoning time.\n\n\"Long time,\" he assured us. He might have meant six years, or sixty. It would have been all the same to him.\n\n\"No. Me not liking Tippoo Tib. One time his slave. That bad. Byumby set free. That good. Now working here. This very good.\"\n\n\"Where do you think the ivory is?\" (This from Yerkes.)\n\nBut the old man shook his head.\n\n\"As I understand it,\" said Monty, \"slaves came mostly from the Congo side of Lake Victoria Nyanza. Slave and elephant country were approximately the same as regards general direction, and there were two routes from the Congo--the southern by way of Ujiji on Tanganyika to Bagamoyo on what is now the German coast, and the other to the north of Victoria Nyanza ending at Mombasa. Ask him, Fred, which way the ivory used to come.\"\n\n\"Both ways,\" announced Juma without waiting for Fred to interpret. He had an uncanny trick of following conversation, his intelligence seeming to work by fits and starts.\n\n\"That gives us about half Africa for hunting-ground, and a job for life!\" laughed Yerkes.\n\n\"Might have a worse!\" Fred answered, resentful of cold water thrown on his discovery.\n\n\"Were you Tippoo Tib's slave when he buried the ivory?\" demanded Monty, and the old man nodded.\n\n\"Where were you at the time?\"\n\nJuma made a gesture intended to suggest immeasurable distances toward the West, and the name of the place he mentioned was one we had never heard of.\n\n\"Can you take us to Tippoo Tib when we leave this place?\" I asked, and he nodded again.\n\n\"How much ivory do you suppose there was?\" asked Yerkes.\n\n\"Teli, teli!\" he answered, shaking his head.\n\n\"Too much!\" Fred translated.\n\n\"Pretty fair to middling vague,\" said Yerkes, \"but\"--judicially--\"almost worth investigating!\"\n\n\"Investigating?\" Fred sprang from his chair. \"It's better than all King Solomon's mines, El Dorado, Golconda, and Sindbad the Sailor's treasure lands--rolled in one! It's an obviously good thing! All we need is a bit of luck and the ivory's ours!\"\n\n\"I'll sell you my share now for a thousand dollars--come--come across!\" grinned Yerkes.\n\nThere was a rough-house after that. He and Fred nearly pulled the old attendant in two, each claiming the right to torture him first and learn the secret. They ended up without a whole rag between them, and had to send Juma to head-quarters for new blue dressing-gowns. The doctor came himself--a fat good-natured party with an eye-glass and a cocktail appetite, acting locum-tenens for the real official who was home on leave. He brought the ingredients for cocktails with him.",
    "\"So this is your gang, is it?\" she went on. \"It looks sober at present! I suppose I must trust you to control them! I dare say even tavern brawlers respect you sufficiently to keep a lady's secret if you order them. I will hope they have manhood enough to hold their tongues!\"\n\nOf course, dressed in the best that Zanzibar stores had to offer we scarcely looked like fashion plates. My shirt was torn where Coutlass had seized it to resist being thrown out, but I failed to see what she hoped to gain by that tongue lashing, even supposing we had been the lackeys she pretended to believe we were.\n\n\"The message is to my brother,\" she went on.\n\n\"I don't know him!\" put in Monty promptly.\n\n\"You mean you don't like him! Your brother had him expelled from two or three clubs, and you prefer not to meet him! Nevertheless, I give you this message to take to him! Please tell him--you will find him at his old address--that I, his sister, Lady Saffren Waldon, know now the secret of Tippoo Tib's ivory. He is to join me here at once, and we will get it, and sell it, and have money, and revenge! Will you tell him that!\"\n\n\"No!\" answered Monty.\n\nI looked at Yerkes, Yerkes looked at Fred, and Fred at me.\n\nThere was nothing to do but feel astonished.\n\n\"Why not, if you please?\"\n\n\"I prefer not to meet Captain McCauley,\" said Monty.\n\n\"Then you will give the message to somebody else?\" she insisted.\n\n\"No\" said Monty. \"I will carry no message for you.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that? How dare you say that? In front of your following--your gang!\"\n\nI should have been inclined to continue the argument myself--to try to find out what she did know, and to uncover her game. It was obvious she must have some reason for her extraordinary request, and her more extraordinary way of making it. But Monty saw fit to stride past her through his open bedroom door, and shut it behind him firmly. We stood looking at her and at one another stupidly until she turned her back and went to her own room on the floor above. Then we followed Monty.\n\n\"Did she say anything else?\" he asked as soon as we were inside. I noticed he was sweating pretty freely now.\n\n\"Didums, you're too polite!\" Fred answered. \"You ought to have told her to keep her tongue housed or be civil!\"\n\n\"I don't hold with hitting back at a lone woman,\" said Yerkes, \"but what was she driving at? What did she mean by calling us a pack of mongrels?\"\n\n\"Merely her way,\" said Monty offhandedly. \"Those particular McCauleys never amounted to much. She married a baronet, and he divorced her. Bad scandal. Saffren Waldon was at the War Office. She stole papers, or something of that sort--delivered them to a German paramour--von Duvitz was his name, I think. She and her brother were lucky to keep out of jail. Ever since then she has been--some say a spy, some say one thing, some another. My brother fell foul of her, and lived to regret it. She's on her last legs I don't doubt, or she wouldn't be in Zanzibar.\"\n\n\"Then why the obvious nervous sweat you're in?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"And that doesn't account for the abuse she handed out to us,\" said Yerkes.\n\n\"Why not tip off the authorities that she's a notorious spy?\" I asked.\n\n\"I suspect they know all about her,\" he answered.\n\n\"But why your alarm?\" insisted Fred.\n\n\"I'm scarcely alarmed, old thing. But it's pretty obvious, isn't it, that she wants us to believe she knows what we're after. She's vindictive. She imagines she owes me a grudge on my brother's account. It might soothe her to think she had made me nervous. And by gad--it sounds like lunacy, and mind you I'm not propounding it for fact!--there's just one chance that she really does know where the ivory is!\"\n\n\"But where's the sense of abusing us?\" repeated Yerkes.\n\n\"That's the poor thing's way of claiming class superiority,\" said Monty. \"She was born into one class, married into another, and divorced into a third. She'd likely to forget she said an unkind word the next time she meets you. Give her one chance and she'll pretend she believes you were born to the purple--flatter you until you half believe it yourself. Later on, when it suits her at the moment, she'll denounce you as a social impostor! It's just habit--bad habit, I admit--comes of the life she leads. Lots of 'em like her. Few of 'em quite so well informed, though, and dangerous if you give 'em a chance.\"",
    "The guard procured his trays at last, delivered them at a run, returned in a hurry and swallowed his own meal at a side-table. Then, with his mouth full, he reported for orders to the railway official, who was still checking figures. The room was beginning to grow empty. Coutlass and his Greek friend and the Goanese sat almost alone at the far end of the other table, finishing their pudding. I had not noticed until then that the guard was a singularly little man. He stood very few inches taller than the seated official. I suppose that hitherto in some way his energy had seemed to increase his inches.\n\n\"Are there handcuffs in the caboose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Fetch them.\"\n\nIn spite of Brown of Lumbwa's protests, who wept at the notion of having to eat alone, we were in the act of settling our bills and going. But mention of handcuffs suggesting entertainment, we lit cigars and, imagining we stayed for love of him, Brown cooed at us.\n\n\"I've the darbies in my pocket, sir!\"\n\nI thought the guard looked more undersized than ever. He would have made a fair-sized middle-weight jockey.\n\n\"Tell that Greek--Coutlass his name is--to come here.\"\n\nWith his tongue stuck into his cheek and a wink at us the guard obeyed.\n\n\"He says for you to go to 'ell, sir!\" he reported after a moment's interview.\n\n\"Very well. Arrest him!\"\n\n\"He'll need help,\" I interrupted. \"My two friends and I--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no,\" said the official. \"He is fully up to his work.\"\n\nSo we moved our chairs into position for a better view.\n\nThe guard advanced fox-terrierwise to within about six paces of Coutlass.\n\n\"Up with both your 'ands, Thermopylea!\" he snapped. \"Your bloomin' reckonin's come!\"\n\nCoutlass showed tobacco-stained teeth for answer, and his friends rutched their chairs clear of the table, ready for action. Yet they were taken unawares. With a terrier's speed the guard pounced on Coutlass, seized him by the hair and collar, hurled him, chair and all, under a side-table, and was on the far side of the table kicking his prostrate victim in the ribs before either Greek or Goanese--likewise upset in the sudden onslaught--could gather themselves and interfere.\n\nThe Goanese was first on his feet. He hurled a soda-water bottle. The guard ducked and the bottle smashed into splinters on the wall. Before the sound of smashing glass had died the Goanese was down again, laid out by blows on the nose and jugular. Then again the guard kicked Coutlass, driving him back under the table from which he was trying to emerge on all fours.\n\nThe second Greek looked more dangerous. His face grew dark with rage as the lips receded from his yellow teeth. He reached toward his boot, but judged there were too many witnesses for knife work and rushed in suddenly, yelling something in Greek to Coutlass as he picked up a chair to brain the guard with. He swung the chair, but the guard met it with another one, dodged him, and tripped him as he passed. In another second it was his turn to be kicked in the ribs until he yelled for mercy. (An extra large dinner and all those assorted drinks in addition to what they had had in the train made neither man's wind good.)\n\nNo mercy was forthcoming. He was kicked, more and more violently, until the need of crawling through the door to safety dawned on his muddled wits and he made his exit from the room snake fashion. By that time Coutlass was on his feet, and he too elected to force the issue with a chair. The guard sprang at the chair as Coutlass raised it, bore it down, and drove his fist hard home into the Greek's right eye three times running.\n\n\"'Ave you 'ad enough?\" he demanded, making ready for another assault. The Goanese had recovered and staggered to his feet to interfere, but Coutlass yielded.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, \"why should I fight a little man? I surrender to save bloodshed!\"\n\n\"Put your 'ands out, then!\"\n\nCoutlass obeyed, and was handcuffed ignominiously.\n\n\"Outside, you!\"\n\nA savage kick landed in exactly the place where the Goanese least expected and most resented it. He flew through the door as if the train had started, and then another kick jolted Coutlass.\n\n\"Forward, march! Left-right-left-right!\"\n\nWith hands manacled in front and the inexorable bantam guard behind, Coutlass came and stood before the railway official, who at last condescended not to seem engrossed in his accounts.\n\n\"'Ere he is, sir!\"\n\n\"I suppose you know, my man, that I have magisterial powers on this railway?\" said the official.\n\nCoutlass glowered but said nothing.\n\n\"This is not the first time you have made yourself a nuisance. You broke dishes the last time you were here.\"\n\n\"That is long ago,\" Coutlass objected. \"That was on the day the place was first opened to the public. There was a celebration. Every one was drunk.\"\n\n\"You broke plates and refused to pay the damage!\"\n\n\"Officials were drunk. I saw them!\"\n\n\"The damage amounted to seventeen rupees, eight annas.\"\n\n\"Gassharamminy! All the crockery from Mombasa to Nairobi isn't worth that amount! I shall not pay!\"\n\n\"Now there's another bill for those drinks you and your friends stole when passengers' backs were turned. I saw you do it!\"\n\n\"Why didn't you object at the time?\" sneered Coutlass.\n\n\"Here is the bill: twenty-seven rupees, twelve annas. Total, forty-five rupees, four annas. You may make the manager a present of the odd sum for his injured feelings, and call it an even fifty. Settle now, or wait here for the down-train and go to jail in Mombasa!\"\n\n\"Wait in this place?\" asked Coutlass, aghast.\n\n\"Where else? There'll be a down passenger train in a week.\"\n\n\"I pay!\" said the Greek, with a hideous grimace.\n\n\"Take the irons off him, then.\"\n\nThe guard unlocked the handcuffs and Coutlass began to fumble for a money-bag.\n\n\"Give me a receipt!\" he demanded, thumbing out the money.\n\n\"You are the receipt!\" said the official. \"An Englishman would have been sent to jail with a fine, and have paid the bill into the bargain. You're treated leniently because you can't be expected to understand decent behavior. You're expected to learn, however. Next time you will catch it hot!\"",
    "I walked away from the post-office alone, trying to puzzle out by myself the meaning of Lady Saffren Waldon's pursuit of us, and of her friendship with the Germans, and her probable connection with Georges Coutlass and his riff-raff. I had not gone far either on my stroll or with the problem--perhaps two hundred yards down a grassy track that they had told me led toward a settlement--when something, not a sound, not a smell, and certainly not sight, for I was staring at the ground, caused me to look up. My foot was raised for a forward step, but what I saw then made me set it down again.\n\nTo my right front, less than ten yards away, was a hillock about twice my own height. To my left front, about twelve yards away was another, slightly higher; and the track passed between them. On the right-hand hillock stood a male lion, full maned, his forelegs well apart and the dark tuft on the end of his tail appearing every instant to one side or the other as he switched it cat-fashion. He was staring down at me with a sort of scandalized interest; and there was nothing whatever for me to do but stare at him. I had no weapon. One spring and a jump and I was his meat. To run was cowardice as well as foolishness, the one because the other. And without pretending to be able to read a lion's thoughts I dare risk the assertion that he was puzzled what to do with me. I could very plainly see his claws coming in and out of their sheaths, and what with that, and the switching tail, and the sense of impotence I could not take my eyes off him. So I did not look at the other hillock at first.\n\nBut a sound like that a cat makes calling to her kittens, only greatly magnified, made me glance to the left in a hurry. I think that up to that moment I had not had time to be afraid, but now the goose-flesh broke out all over me, and the sensation up and down my spine was of melting helplessness.\n\nOn the left-hand hillock a lioness stood looking down with much intenser and more curious interest. She looked from me to her mate, and from her mate to me again with indecision that was no more reassuring than her low questioning growl.\n\nI do not know why they did not spring on me. Surely no two lions ever contemplated easier quarry. No victim in the arena ever watched the weapons of death more helplessly. I suppose my hour had not come. Perhaps the lions, well used to white men who attacked on sight with long-range weapons, doubted the wisdom of experiments on something new.\n\nThe lioness growled again. Her mate purred to her with an uprising reassuring note that satisfied her and sent my heart into my boots. Then he turned, sprang down behind the hillock, and she followed. The next I saw of them they were running away like dogs, jumping low bushes and heading for jungle on the near horizon faster than I had imagined lions could travel.",
    "She and her maid arrived last, as it was growing dusk. We had already seen what there was to see of the town. We had been to the post-office on the white man's habitual hunt, for mail that we knew was non-existent. And I had had the first adventure.\n\nShe was determined now, mistress of the situation and of her plans. She left to her maid the business of quarreling about accommodations; (there was little left to choose from, and all was bare and bad); dismissed the obsequious settler and his porters with perfunctory thanks that left him no excuse for lingering, and came along the veranda straight toward us with the smile of old acquaintance, and such an air of being perfectly at ease that surprise was disarmed, and the rudeness we all three intended died stillborn.\n\n\"What do you think of the country?\" she asked. \"Men like it as a rule. Women detest it, and who can blame them? No comfort--no manners--no companionship--no meals fit to eat--no amusement! Have you killed anything or anybody yet? That always amuses a man!\"\n\nWe rose to make room for her and I brought her a chair. There was nothing else one could do. There is almost no twilight in that part of East Africa; until dark there is scarcely a hint that the day is waning. She sat with us for twenty or thirty minutes making small talk, her maid watching us from a window above, until the sun went down with almost the suddenness of gas turned off, and in a moment we could scarcely see one another's faces.\n\nThen came the proprietor to the door, with his best ex-missionary air of knowledge of all earth's ways, their reason and their trend.\n\n\"All in!\" he called. \"All inside at once! No guest is allowed after dark on the veranda! All inside! Supper presently!\"\n\n\"Pah!\" remarked Lady Saffren Waldon, rising. \"What is it about some men that makes one's blood boil? I suppose we must go in.\"\n\nShe came nearer until she stood between the three of us, so close that I could see her diamond-hard eyes and hear the suppressed breathing that I suspected betrayed excitement.\n\n\"I must speak with you three men! Listen! I know this place. The rooms are unspeakable--not a bedroom that isn't a megaphone, magnifying every whisper! There is only one suitable place--the main dining-room. The proprietor leaves the oil-lamp burning in there all night. People go to bed early; they prefer to drink in their bedrooms because it costs less than treating a crowd! I shall provide a light supper, and my maid shall lay the table after everybody else is gone up-stairs. Then come down and talk with me. Its important! Be sure and come!\"\n\nShe did not wait for an answer but led the way into the hotel. There was no hall. The door led straight into the dining-room, and the noisy crowd within, dragging chairs and choosing places at the two long tables, made further word with her impossible, even if she had not hurried up-stairs to her room.\n\n\"What do you make of it--of her? Isn't she the limit?\"\n\nThe words were scarcely out of Will's mouth when a roar that made the dishes rattle broke and echoed and rumbled in the street outside. The instant it died down another followed it--then three or four--then a dozen all at once. There came the pattering of heavy feet, like the sound of cattle coming homeward. Yet no cattle--no buffaloes ever roared that way.\n\n\"Now you know why I ordered you all inside,\" grinned the ex-missionary owner of the place. I divined on the instant that this was his habit, to stand by the door before supper and say just those words to the last arrivals. I had a vision of him standing by his mission door aforetime, repeating one jest, or more likely one stale euphuism night after night.\n\n\"Lions?\" I asked, hating to take the bait, yet curious beyond power to resist.\n\n\"Certainly they're lions! Did you think you were dreaming? Are you glad you came in when I called you? Would you rather go out again now? Make a noise like a herd of cattle, don't they! That's because they're bold. They don't care who hears them! The day is ours. It used to be theirs, but the white man has come and broken up their empire. The night is still theirs. They're reveling in it! They're boasting of it! Every single night they come swaggering through like this just after sunset. They'll come again just before dawn, roaring the same way. You'll hear them. They'll wake you all right. No trouble in this hotel about getting guests down-stairs for early breakfast!\"\n\n\"I'll get my rifle and settle the hash of one or two of them before I eat supper!\" announced Will, turning away to make good his words. But the proprietor seized him by the arm.\n\n\"Don't be foolish! It has been tried too often! I never allowed such foolishness at my place. A party up-street fired from the windows. Couldn't see very well in the dark, but wounded two or three lions. What happened, eh? Why the whole pack of lions laid siege to the house! They broke into the stable and killed three horses, a donkey, and all the cows and sheep. There weren't any shutters on the house windows--nothing but glass. It wasn't long before a young lion broke a window, and in no time there were three full-grown ones into the house after him. They injured one man so severely that he died next day. They only shot two of the lions that got inside. The other two got safely away, and since that time people here have known enough not to interfere with them except by daylight! They'll do no harm to speak of unless you fire and enrage them. They'll kill the stray dogs, or any other animal they find loose; and heaven help the man they meet! But the place to be after six P.M. in Nairobi is indoors. And it's the place to stay until after sunrise! Hear them roar! Aren't they magnificent? Listen!\"\n\nThe noise that twenty or thirty lions can make, deliberately bent on making it and roaring all at once, is unbelievable. They throw their heads up and glory in strength of lungs until thunders take second place and the listener knows why not the bravest, not the most dangerous of beasts has managed to impose the fable of his grandeur on men's imagination.\n\nWe were summoned to the table by the din of Georges Coutlass rising to new heights of gallantry.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!\" he shouted, thumping with a scarred fist. With a poultice on his eye he looked like a swashbuckler home from the wars; and as he had not troubled to shave himself, the effect was heightened. \"What sort of company sits when a titled lady enters!\" He seized a big spoon and rapped on the board with it. \"Blood of an onion! Rise, every one!\"\n\nEverybody rose, although there were men in the room in no mind to be told their duty by a Greek. Lady Saffren Waldon walked to a place near the head of the table with a chilling bow. As usual when night and the yellow lamplight modified merciless outlines, she looked lovely enough. But she lacked the royal gift of seeming at home with the vulgar herd. She could make men notice her--serve her, up to a certain point--and feel that she was the center of interest wherever she might choose to be; but because she was everlastingly on guard, she lacked the power to put mixed company at ease.\nOnly the ex-missionary at the head of the table seemed to consider himself socially qualified to entertain her. She was at no pains to conceal contempt for him.",
    "\"Nun--recht feste schlagen!\"* ordered Schubert. Then he took the sleeve of his tunic between his teeth and hid his face. [*Now, hit good and hard!]\n\n\"One!\" said the referee. Down came the heavy black whip with a crack like a gun going off. Schubert neither winced nor murmured, but the blood welled into the seat of his pants and spread like red ink on blotting-paper.\n\n\"'One!\" said the referee again. The corporal faced about, and raised his weapon, standing on tiptoe to get more swing. Sachse flinched at the sound of the whip going up, and the other sergeants roared delight. But he was still when it descended, and the crack of the blow drew neither murmur nor movement from him either. Like the feldwebel, he had his sleeve between his teeth.\n\n\"Two!\" said the referee, and the black whip rose again. It descended with a crack and a splash on the very spot whence the blood flowed, this time cutting the pants open, but Schubert took no more notice of it than if a fly had settled on him. There was a chorus of applause.\n\n\"Two!\" said the referee. Again the corporal faced about and balanced himself on tiptoe. Sachse was much the more nervous of the two. He flinched again while waiting for the blow, but met it when it did come without a tremor of any kind. He was much the softer. Blood flowed from him more freely, but his pants seemed to be of sterner stuff, for they did not split until the eight-and-twentieth lash, or thereabouts.\n\nFrom first to last, although the raw flesh lay open to the lash, and the corporal, urged to it by the united threats and praise of all the other sergeants, wrought his utmost, Schubert lay like a man asleep. He might have been dead, except for the even rise and fall of his breathing, that never checked or quickened once. Nine-and-forty strokes he took without a sign of yielding. At the eight-and-fortieth Sachse moaned a little, and the referee gave the match against him. Schubert rose to his feet unaided, grinning, red in the face, but without any tortured look.\n\n\"Now you can say forever that you have flogged two white men!\" he told the askari.\n\n\"Who will believe me?\" the man answered.\n\nSachse had to be helped to his feet. He was pale and demanded brandy.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" laughed Schubert. \"A Prussian is better than any man! Look at him, and then at me!\"\n\nHe shouted for his servant, who had to be fetched from the boma--a smug-faced little rascal, obviously in love with the glory reflected on the sergeant-major's servant. He was made to produce a basin and cold water--he discovered them somewhere in the dim recesses of the store--and sponge his master's raw posterior before us all. Then he was sent for clean white pants and presently Schubert, only refusing to sit down, was quite himself again.\n\nSachse on the other hand refused the ministrations of the boy--was annoyed by the chaff of the other sergeants--refused to drink any of the sweet champagne he would now have to pay for--and went away in great dudgeon, murmuring about the madness that takes hold of men in Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, while Schubert strutted and swaggered, making jokes more raw and beastly than his own flogged hide, the Jew came and poured more cool water on my hot bandages, touching them with deft fingers that looked like the hairy legs of a huge spider--his touch more gentle--more fugitive than any woman's.\n\n\"You should not tell zat dam feldwebel nozink!\" he advised in nasal English. \"Nefer mind vat you tell heem he is all ze same not your frien. He only obey hees officers. Zey say to cut your troat--he cut it! Zey say to tell you a lot o' lies--he tell! He iss not a t'inker, but a doer: and hees faforite spectacle iss ze blood of innocence! Do not effer say I did not tell you! On ze ozzer hand, tell no one zat I did tell! Zese are dangerous people!\"\n\nHe resumed business with his account book, and I whispered to Fred and Will what advice he had given. Seeing us with our heads together, Schubert crossed the room, beginning to get very drunk now that the shock of the flogging had had time to reinforce the alcohol. (The blows had sobered him at first.)\n\n\"What have you decided?\" he asked, standing before us with his legs apart and his hands behind him in his favorite attitude--swaying gently back and forward because of the drink, and showing all his teeth in a grin.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Fred answered. \"We'll think it over.\"\n\n\"Too late in the morning!\" he answered, continuing to sway. \"I can do nothing for you in the morning.\"\n\n\"What can you do to-night?\" Fred asked.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"I can report. The report will go in at dawn.\"\n\n\"You may tell your superiors,\" Fred answered, rising, \"that if they care to make us a reasonable offer, I don't say we won't do business!\"\n\nSchubert leered.\n\n\"To-morrow will be too late!\" he repeated.\n\n\nIt was Fred's turn to shrug shoulders, and he did it inimitably, turning his back on Schubert and helping Will support me to the door. The feldwebel stood grinning while I held to the doorpost and they dragged Brown to his feet. He made no offer to help us in any way at all, nor did any of the sergeants.\n\n\nThere was no getting action from Brown. He was as dead to the world as a piece of wood, and there being no other obvious solution of the problem, Will hoisted him upon his back and carried him, he snoring, all the way home to camp. Fred hoisted and carried me, for the pain of my wound when I tried to walk was unbearable.\n\n\nWe reached camp abreast and were challenged by the sentries, who made a great show of standing guard. They took Brown and threw him on the bed in his own tent--accepted Fred's offer of silver money--and departed, marching up-street in their heavy, iron-bound military boots with the swing and swagger only the Nubian in all the world knows just how to get away with.",
    "So we ate a scratch breakfast and Fred and Will helped me up-street, past where the Jew stood blinking in the morning sun on the steps of the D.O.A.G. He seemed to be saying prayers, but beckoned to us.\n\n\"Trouble!\" he said. \"Trouble! If you have any frien's fetch them--send for them!\"\n\n\"Can yon send a letter for us to British East?\" Fred asked him.\n\n\"God forbid!\" He jumped at the very thought, and shrugged himself like a man standing under a water-spout. \"What would they do to me if I were found out?\"\n\n\"What is the nature of the trouble?\" Fred asked him.\n\n\"Ali, who should tell! Trouble, I tell you, trouble! Zat cursed Schubert sat here drinking until dawn. I heard heem say many t'ings! Send for your friens!\"\n\nHe turned his back on us and ran in. There was a lieutenant arrayed in spotless white with a saber in glittering scabbard watching us all from the boma gate. A little later that morning we knew better why the Jew fled indoors at sight of him.\n\nSchubert was standing in mid-square with a hundred askaris lined up two-deep in front of him. There were no other Germans on parade. The corporals were Nubians, and the rest of the rank and file either Nubian or some sort of Sudanese. He was haranguing them in a bastard mixture of Swahili, Arabic, and German, they standing rigidly at attention, their rifles at the present.\n\nNot content with the effect of his words, he strode up presently to a front-rank man and hit him in the face with clenched fist. In the effort to recover his balance the man let his rifle get out of alignment. Schubert wrenched it from him. It fell to the ground. He struck the man, and when he stooped to pick the rifle up kicked him in the face. Then he strode down the line and beat two other men for grinning. All this the lieutenant watched without a sign of disapproval, or even much interest.\n\nMeanwhile the chain-gang emerged from the boma gate, going full-pelt, fastened neck to neck, the chain taut and each man carrying a water-jar. The minute they had crossed the square Schubert commenced with company drill, and for two hours after that, with but one interval of less than five minutes for rest, he kept them pounding the gravel in evolution after evolution--manual exercise at the double--skirmishing exercise--setting up drill--goose-step, and all the mechanical, merciless precision drill with which the Germans make machines of men.\n\nHis debauch did not seem in the least to have affected him, unless to make his temper more violently critical. By seven o'clock the sun was beating down on him and dazzling his eyes from over the boma wall. The dust rose off the square. The words of command came bellowing in swift succession from a throat that ought to have been hard put to it to whisper. If anything, he grew more active and exacting as the askaris wearied, and by the time the two hours were up they were ready to a man to drop.\n\nBut not so he. He dismissed them, and swaggered over to the marketplace to hector and bully the natives who were piling their wares in the shade of the great grass roof. Then he went into the boma to breakfast just as a sergeant in khaki came over and unlocked the hospital door. I followed the sergeant in, but he ordered me out again.\n\n\"I have come to see the doctor,\" I said. \"I need attention.\"\n\nHe was not one of the sergeants who had been drunk in the D.O.A.G. the night before, but a man of a higher mental type, although no less surly.\n\n\"It will be for the doctor to say what you need when he has seen you!\" he answered, turning his back and busying himself about the room. Will translated, and I limped out again.\n\nBy and by the doctor came, and passed me sitting on the steps amid a throng of natives who seemed to have all the imaginable kinds of sores. He took no notice of me, but sent out the sergeant to inquire why I had not stood up as he passed. I did not answer, and the sergeant went in again.\n\nFred by that time was simply blasphemous, alternately threatening to go in and kick the doctor, and condemning Will's determination to do the same thing. Finally we decided to see the matter through patiently, and all sat together on the steps watching the activity of the square. There was a lot going on--bartering of skins and hides--counting of crocodile eggs, brought in by natives for sake of the bounty of a few copper coins the hundred--a cock-fight in one corner--the carrying to and fro of bunches of bananas, meat, and grain in baskets; and in and out among it all full pelt in the hot sun marched the chain-gang, doing the township dirty work.\n\nBy and by Schubert emerged from the boma gate followed by natives carrying a table and a soap-box. He set these under a limb of the great baobab that faced the boma gate not far from the middle of the square. I noticed then for the first time that a short hempen rope hung suspended from the largest branch, with a noose in the end. The noose was not more than two feet below the branch.\n\nSchubert's consideration of the table's exact position, and the placing of the soap-box on the table, was interrupted by the arrival of Coutlass, his Greek companion and the Goanese arm in arm, followed closely by two askaris who shouted angrily and made a great show of trying to prevent them. One of the askaris aimed his rifle absurdly at Coutlass, both Greeks and the Goanese daring him gleefully to pull the trigger.\n\nThey purposely came close to us, not that we showed signs of meaning to befriend them. They were simply unable to understand that there are degrees of disgrace. To Coutlass all victims of government outrage ought surely to be more than friendly with any one in conflict with the law. Personal quarrels should go for nothing in face of the common wrong.\n\n\"There is going to be a hanging!\" Coutlass shouted to us. \"They thought we would remain quietly in camp with that going on! Give us chairs!\" he called to Schubert. \"Provide us a place in the front row where we may see!\"\n\nSchubert grinned. He returned to the boma yard and presumably conferred with an officer, for presently he came out again and gave the Greeks leave to stand under the tree, provided they would return to camp afterward. Later yet, Brown came along and joined us on the steps, looking red-eyed and ridiculous.\n\n\"Goin' to be a hangin,\" he announced. \"I been askin' natives about it. Black man stole the condemned man's daughter an' refused to pay cows for her accordin' to custom or anythin'--said he could do what the white men did an' help himself. Father of the girl took a spear and settled the thief's hash with it--ran him through--did a clean job. Serve him right--eh--what? Germans went an' nabbed him, though--tried him in open court--goin' to hang him this mornin' for murder! How does it strike you?\"\n\nWe were not exactly in mood to talk to Brown--in fact, we wished him anywhere but with us, but he thought self perfectly welcome, and rambled on:\n\n\"Up in British East we don't hang black men for murder unless it's what they call an aggravated case--murder an' robbery--murder an' arson--murder an' rape. Hang a white man for murderin' a black sure as you're sitting here, an' shoot a black man for murderin' a white; but the blacks don't understand, so when they kill one another in such a case this, why we give 'em a short jail sentence an' a good lo lecture, an' let 'em go again. These folks have it t'other way round. They never hang a German, whether he's guilty or not, but hang a poor black man, what doesn't understand, for half o' nothin'!\"\n\n\nA great crowd began gathering about the tree, and was presently driven by askaris with whips into a mass on the far side of the tree from us. Whether purposely or not, they left a clear view from the hospital steps of all that should happen. Evidently warning had been sent out broadcast, for the inhabitants of village after village came trooping into town to watch, each lot led by its sultani in filthy rags and the foolish imitation crown his conquerors had supplied him at several times its proper price. The square was a dense sea of people before nine o'clock, and the askaris made the front few hundreds lie, and the next rows squat, in order that the men and women behind might see.",
    "\"Silence! Sit down!\"\n\n\"I warn you!\" Fred answered. \"That boy has claimed British protection. I shall see he has it!\"\n\nThen he sat down. The lieutenant glared at Kazimoto, the glare changing to a cold grin as he realized how fully we were all at his mercy for the moment.\n\n\"You are sentenced,\" he said, \"to two hundred lashes for making impudent answers to the court, and to six months on the chain-gang for deserting from this country and entering foreign service. Further evidence against you will be assembled in the meanwhile, and other charges against you will be tried on completion of the chain-gang sentence!\"\n\n\"I protest!\" shouted Fred, jumping up again. \"I give notice of appeal to whatever higher court there is. I am ready to give bonds!\"\n\n\"What does this delay mean?\" snapped the lieutenant. \"Put him down at once and lay the lashes on!\"\n\nThe unfortunate Kazimoto was pounced on by two askaris and thrown face-downward on the floor. One of them tore off his clothes, ripping up his good English jacket.\n\n\"Did you hear my protest?\" shouted Fred. \"Did you hear my notice of appeal?\"\n\n\"I did,\" said the lieutenant. \"Appeals are heard at the coast. You must give notice by mail, and receive an acknowledgment from the higher military court before I grant stay of execution. Lay on the lashes!\"\n\n\"I will hold you personally liable for this outrage,\" Fred told him, \"if it costs me all my money and all the rest of my years! I defy you to continue!\"\n\n\"You have yourself to blame!\" the lieutenant grinned. \"But for your uninvited interruption the Nyamwezi would have had a better hearing! Lay those lashes on harder and more slowly!\"\n\nKazimoto was taking his gruel like a man. Two askaris were beating him. The blows fell at random anywhere below the neck and above the heels, raising a great welt where they did not actually cut the skin. He had buried his face in his forearms, and Will had gone to stand near him, stooping down to encourage him with any words at all that might seem to serve.\n\n\"Stick it out, Kazi! We'll stand by! We won't leave you down here! Remember you've got friends who won't desert you!\"\n\nProbably in his agony Kazimoto did not understand a word of it, but the lieutenant did,--and swiftly took steps to interfere.\n\n\"Call the Europeans' cases next!\" he shouted, and promptly the German sergeants stepped down from the platform to marshal us in line. The lieutenant went through the form of studying the blue papers, and called out our names. That of Brown was included, but Brown was not in court and we were kept standing there until he had been fetched from his tent. He had retired immediately after the hanging to sleep off the effects of his debauch, and being now deprived of that luxury arrived between two askaris in a volcanic temper. He insulted the lieutenant to begin with.\n\n\"A diet o' beer an' sausage don't seem to have filled you full o' good manners, do it?\"\n\nThe lieutenant scowled, but for the moment chose to ignore the pleasantry.\n\n\"You people are charged,\" he said, \"with entering German territory otherwise than by a regular road and without reporting at a customs station. Further, with intending to defraud the customs--with carrying and possessing arms without a license--with being in possession of ammunition without a permit--with shooting game without a license--with filibustering--with intentional homicide, in that you shot and killed certain men of the Masai tribe within German territory--with wandering at large without permits and with felonious intent; and last, and this is the most serious charge, with being spies within the military meaning of that term. Do you plead guilty or not guilty?\"\n\nWe were dumb. Even the crack of the heavy whips on poor Kazimoto's skin ceased to make impression on us. Suffering already from my wound to the point of nausea, I actually reeled before this new deluge of trouble, and had to hold on to Fred and Will. They each put an arm under mine. It was Brown who spoke and stole from our sails what little wind there might have been.\n\n\"Decline to plead!\" he shouted boisterously. \"You're no judge, you're a pirate! You're not fit to try natives, let alone white men! You're a disgrace, that's what you are! All you're fit for is to make a decent fellow glad he needn't know you!\"\n\n\"Silence!\" roared the lieutenant, banging on the table with his open palm--then with his fist--then with a mallet.\n\n\"Silence yourself!\" retorted Brown as soon as the hammering ceased. \"You ought to be ashamed o' yourself! Your court's a bally disgrace, an' you're the worst thing in it! You and your Kaiser can go to hell, and be damned to both of you!\"\n\n\"One month in jail for contempt of court and Majestaets-beleidigung!\" snapped the lieutenant. \"Take him away!\"\n\nQuite clearly that was not the first time that a white man had been imprisoned in Muanza. There was no hesitation about the way in which an askari seized Brown's wrists or a sergeant snapped the handcuffs. He was hustled out expostulating, kicked on the shins by the sergeant when he faced about to argue, and shoved into a run by both sergeant and askari.\n\n\"You others would better be careful what you say!\" said the lieutenant.\n\n\"I've a mind to share Brown's cell!\" said Will, but the lieutenant affected not to hear that.\n\n\"Since you refuse to plead in this court, you shall be held until the arrival of Major Schunck from the coast. Your arms and ammunition are to be handed over to the askaris, who will be sent to the rest-camp to receive them. The askaris will search your belongings thoroughly to make sure they have all your weapons. You are ordered confined within the limits of this township, and if you are detected making any attempt to trespass outside township limits you will be confined as the Greeks are within the rest-camp under observation. The porters you brought into the country are all to be paid their full wages by you until Major Schunck shall have dealt with you; the porters are refused permission to leave Muanza, being needed as witnesses. Next case!\"\n\nHe scrawled his signature at the foot of each sheet of blue paper, and made a motion with his arm that we should leave court. But we sat down and waited until the two Nubian giants had finished flogging Kazimoto, and when they dragged him to his feet Will and Fred walked over to give him a few words of comfort. That act of ordinary kindness threw the lieutenant into another fury.\n\n\"Bring the Nyamwezi here!\" he ordered, and the askaris hustled him up in front of the table.\n\n\"What do you do? Have you no manners? Return proper thanks for the lesson you have received!\"\n\nKazimoto stood silent.\n\n\"For God's sake--\" Will began.\n\n\"Say 'Thank you' to him, Kazimoto!\" Fred whispered.\n\nThere is no native word for \"Thank you\"--only a bastard thing introduced by tyrants from Europe who never understood the African contention that the giver rewards himself if his gift is worth anything at all.\n\n\"Asente,\" said Kazimoto meekly.\n\n\"Why don't you salute? Don't you know where you are?\"\n\n\"For the love of God salute him!\" Will almost shouted.\n\nKazimoto obeyed.\n\n\"Take him and put him on the chain-gang!\" ordered the lieutenant. \"You Europeans leave the court!\"\n\n\"I'm no European!\" Will shouted back. \"Thank the Lord I was born in a country you'll never set foot in!\"\n\n\"Take them away before I have to make an example of them!\" the lieutenant ordered.\n\n\nObediently the askaris gathered about us and hustled us out into the open, poking at my bandaged wound to get swifter action, and going as far as to threaten us with their hippo-hide whips. I trod on the naked toe of one of them with sufficient suddenness and weight to deprive him of the use of it for all time, and luckily for me he did not see who did it. The askari next to him had boots on, and got the blame.",
    "The chief and his followers far outdistanced us in spite of their gorged condition--all except the woman, who jogged dutifully, although unhappily, behind Fred. When we reached the campfires they were standing gazing out on the lake, where we could just make out the bellying sail of the Queen of Sheba leaning like a phantom away from the gaining wind. The distance was not to be judged in that weak uncertain light. We all shouted together, but there came no answer and we could not tell whether the sound carried as far as the dhow or not.\n\n\"Gassharamminy!--why don't you shoot!\" shouted Coutlass, dancing up and down the bank in frenzy. \"Give me that rifle! I'll show you! I'll teach them!\"\n\nI believe I would have fired if the rifle had been in my hands. Brown, last to arrive and most out of breath, joined with Coutlass in angry shouts for vengeance. Will offered no argument against sending them a parting shot. Fred set the butt of the rifle down with a determined snort, walked over toward the fire, stirred the embers, threw on more fuel, and looked about him when the dry wood blazed.\n\n\"If she has left as much as one blanket among the lot of us, I don't see it anywhere!\" he said, taking his seat on a rock.\n\n\"A blanket?\" sneered Coutlass. \"She has even your money! Worse than that--she has my woman! You were a gum-gasted galoot not to shoot at her!\"\n\nFred patted the bulging pocket of his shooting jacket.\n\n\"Most of the money is here,\" he said quietly, and we all sighed with relief.\n\n\"Take canoes and chase them!\" shouted Coutlass, beginning to dance up and down again.\n\n\"There's time enough\" Fred answered. \"We know the winds of these parts well enough by this time. This will blow until midnight. Then calm until dawn. After dawn a little more wind for an hour or two, then doldrums again until late afternoon. They'll run on a rock in all likelihood. If they do we can catch them at our leisure, supposing we can get these islanders to paddle. If it should blow hard, then we can't catch them anyhow. Sit down and tell us what happened, Coutlass!\"\n\nThe Greek cursed and swore and pranced, but all in vain. Fred was inexorable. We others grew calmer when the problem of who should paddle the canoes solved itself suddenly with the arrival of fourteen of our own men. Discovering themselves left behind, they had run along the bank in vain hope of catching the dhow somehow--perchance of swimming through the crocodile-infested water, and returned now disconsolate, to leap and laugh with new hope at sight of us and of the red meat that Kazimoto had thrown on the ground near the fire. They came near in a cluster. Will hacked off a lump of meat for them, and they forthwith forgot their troubles, as instantly as the birds forget when a sparrow-hawk has done murder down a hedge-row and swooped away.\n\nNot everything was gone after all. Kazimoto found the pots we had cooked the rice in, and started to boil the hippo's tongue for us.\n\n\"Come, Coutlass--sit down before we eat and tell us what happened,\" Fred suggested.\n\nThe Greek paced up and down another time or two, and at last calmed himself sufficiently to laugh at Fred's woman, who had squatted down patiently in the shadow behind him.\n\n\"Easy for you!\" he grinned savagely, squatting on the far side of the fire. \"You have a woman! Mine is God knows where! She said to me--that hell-damned Lady Saffren Waldon said to me--we sat all three together in the stern of the dhow, I with my arm around Rebecca, and she said to me--\"\n\n\"I'll see if I can't make a dicker for the chief's canoes,\" Will interrupted. \"We can hear the Greek's tale any old time.\"\n\n\"Trade my woman for them!\" Fred suggested cheerfully. \"Go on, Coutlass!\"\n\nThe Greek gritted his teeth savagely. \"She said--that hell-damned Lady Saffren Waldon said, as we sat there in the dhow, 'How about the kicking Fred Oakes gave you on the island, Mr. Coutlass? Where is your Greek honor?'--Do you see? She worked on my bodily bruises and my spiritual courage at the same time--the cunning hussy! 'That Fred Oakes will win this Rebecca away from you very soon!' she went on. 'I have watched him.\"'\n\nFred smiled about as comfortably as a martyr on the grid. The presence of the dusky damsel, confirmed by her smell behind him, made him touchy on the subject of sex.\n\n\"Presently she said to me, 'I have my own affairs that will adjust themselves all the better for their absence when I get to British East. As for you, they will simply report you to the authorities for raiding those cattle of Brown's. Can you imagine that creature Brown forgiving you? He will have you thrown in jail! Why wait? But we must not leave the Goanese or the other porters, and we must hurry! You go,' she said, 'and send the Goanese and the rest of the porters on board!'\n\n\"So I did go. I kicked de Sousa awake, and he cursed me, because my toe landed once or twice on his thigh where the bullet wounded him. I drove him on board, and she put him to work with Kamarajes getting up the sail. Then I went off to get those cursed porters. I could not find them! The dogs had gone to the village, to find women I don't doubt! I tell you what I would do to them if they were mine!\"\n\n\"Never mind that!\" Fred cut in. \"We could all guess what form the punishment would take. Get on with the tale! You couldn't find the porters. What next?\"\n\n\"I decided to leave the dogs behind, and serve them right! I went back to the dhow in a great hurry. She was gone! Vanished! Disappeared as if the lake had opened up and swallowed her! I could just see the sail in the distance. I shouted! No answer! I shouted again. I heard Rebecca call to me! Then I heard laughter--Lady Isobel Saffren Waldon's laughter! Gassharamminy! I will run red-hot skewers into that woman when I catch her! Do you see how she has vengeance on Rebecca? Do you see now why she took sides between me and Kamarajes and de Sousa? Do you see how she has plotted? What will she do now? What Will she do?\"\n\nHe began to pace up and down again furiously, shaking both fists at the unresponsive stars.",
    "One of our Nyamwezi porters suddenly made a great shout of \"Hodi!\" and came stooping through the low door, standing erect again inside to await our pleasure. We could hear others outside, listening under the eaves. When we had kept him waiting sufficiently long to prevent his getting too much notion of his own importance, Fred nodded to him to speak.\n\n\"Is it true, bwana,\" he asked, \"that the Germans will come soon and conquer this part of Africa?\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Fred.\n\n\"There is one out here, a Baganda, who says they will surely come. He says the religion of Islam will be preached from end to end of everywhere, and that the Germans are the true priests of Islam. They will come, says he, when the time is ripe, and call on all the converts of Islam to rise and slay all other people, including all white folk, like the English, who do not accept that creed. If that is true, bwana, whither shall we go, and whither shall you go, to escape such terrible things?\"\n\n\"Does the Baganda know there are white men in this village?\" Fred asked.\n\n\"Not yet, bwana.\"\n\n\"Don't tell him, then, but bring him in here. Tell him there are folk in here who say he is a liar.\"\n\nThe Nyamwezi backed out, and we heard whispering outside. There is precious little performance in Africa without a deal of talk. At the end of about ten minutes the porter again shouted \"Hodi!\" and this time was followed in by the stranger, seven other of our own men, uninvited, bringing up the rear.\n\n\"Jambo!\" said the Baganda, with a great effort at bravado, when his eyes had grown accustomed to the gloom and the first severe surprise of seeing white men had worn off. He was a very cool customer indeed.\n\n\"Whose pimp are you?\" demanded Fred, without answering the salutation.\n\nThe man fell back on insolence at once. There is no native in Africa who takes more keenly to that weapon than the mission-schooled Baganda.\n\n\"I am employed by a gentleman of superior position,\" he answered in perfectly good English.\n\n\"In what capacity?\" demanded Fred.\n\n\"I am not employed to tell his secrets to the first strangers who ask me!\"\n\n\"Do you obey him implicitly?\"\n\n\"I do. I am honorable person. I receive his pay and do his bidding.\"\n\n\"Is his name Schillingschen?\"\n\nThe Baganda hesitated.\n\n\"All right,\" said Fred. \"I know his name is Schillingschen. You have boasted that you do what he orders you. These men tell me you have said that the Germans are coming to conquer the country and destroy all people, including the English, who have not accepted Islam!\"\n\nThe man hesitated again, glancing over his shoulder to discover his retreat cut off by our porters, and eying Fred with malignity that reminded one of a cornered beast of prey. He could control his face, but not his eyes.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir!\" he answered after swallowing a time or two. \"How could they tell such lies against me! I am a person born in Uganda, now a British protectorate and enjoying all blessings of British rule. I am educated at the mission college at Entebbe. How should I tell such a tale against my benefactors?\"\n\n\"That is what you are here to explain!\" Fred answered. \"No! You can't escape, you hellion! Squat down and answer!\"\n\n\"All this stuff is pretty familiar,\" Will interrupted. \"In the States there are always people going the rounds among our darkies preaching some form of treason. Over there we can afford to treat it as a joke--now and then an ugly one, and on the darkies!\"\n\n\"This is an ugly joke on a darkie, too!\" grinned Fred.\n\nThe Baganda made a sudden dive and a determined struggle to get through the door, but our porters were too quick and strong for him.\n\n\"Confession is your one chance!\" said Fred.\n\n\"Put hot irons to his feet!\" advised Coutlass. (The native beer had left him villainously evil-tempered.) \"Gassharamminy! Leave me alone with that fat Baganda for half an hour, and I will make him tell me what is on the far side of the moon, as well as what his mother said and did before she bore him!\"\n\n\"Shall I hand you over to this Greek gentleman?\" suggested Fred.\n\n\"Oh, my God, no!\" the Baganda answered, trembling. \"Hand me over to the bwana collector! He will put me in jail. I am not afraid of British jail! It will not be for long! The English do not punish as the Germans do! You dare not assault me! You dare not torture me! You must hand me over to the bwana collector to be tried in court of law. Nothing else is permissible! I shall receive short sentence, that is all, with reprieve after two-thirds time on account of good conduct!\"\n\n\"Make him prisoner in the sleeping sickness village you told us about!\" advised Coutlass, lolling at ease on his elbow to watch the man's increasing fear.\n\n\"Oh, no, no! Oh, gentlemen! That is not how white Englishmen behave! You must either let me go, or--\"\n\nHe made another terrific dive for liberty, biting and kicking at his captors, and finally lying on his back to scream as if the hot irons Coutlass had recommended were being applied in earnest.\n\n\"What shall we do with the beast?\" asked Fred. The hut was so full of his infernal screaming that we could talk without his hearing us.\n\n\"Tie him up,\" I said. \"If we let him go he'll run straight to Schillingschen.\"\n\n\"Leave him here with Coutlass and me!\" urged Brown. (He and Coutlass had grown almost friendly since getting drunk together on the native beer.)\n\n\"I recommend,\" said Will, \"that we take the law in our own hands--take the law in our own hands, and thrash him soundly. Later on we can report what we have done to the British government, and ask for condonation under the circumstances or pay whatever piffling fine they care to impose for the sake of appearances. The point is, there's no court of law in these parts to hand him over to, and he needs punishing.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Fred. \"Let's thrash him to begin with.\"\n\n\"Let's thrash him,\" went on Will, \"as thoroughly as we've seen his friends the Germans do the job!\"\n\n\"Both sides!\" agreed Brown.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no! You can not do that, gentlemen!\"\n\n\"Lay him out!\" ordered Fred. \"Let's begin on him. Who shall beat him first?\"",
    "The probability was he would stir up the countryside against us. He had been doing missionary work; it might be the natives of that part were already sufficiently schooled to do murder at his bidding.\n\nWe decided to leave at once for a district where he had not yet done any of his infernal preaching.\n\n\"You should set a trap and shoot the swine!\" Coutlass insisted. Will was inclined to agree with him, but Fred and I demurred. The British writ had never really run as far as the slopes of Elgon, and we could see them ahead of us not very many marches away. If Schillingschen intended to dog us and watch chances we preferred to have him do that in a remote wilderness, where our prospect of influencing natives would likely be as good as his, that was all.\n\nPart of our strategy was to make an early start and march swiftly, taking advantage of his physical weariness after a night in the open on the prowl; but after a few days in camp it is the most difficult thing imaginable to get a crowd of porters started on the march. It was more particularly difficult on that occasion because none of our men were familiar with Schillingschen's loads, and the captured ten, even when we loosed their hands and treated them friendly, showed no disposition to be useful. We gave them a load apiece to carry, but to every one we had to assign two of our own as guards, so that, what with having lost the fifteen donkeys, we had not a man to spare.\n\nIt was after midday when we got off at last. We had not left the camp more than half a mile behind when I looked back and saw Schillingschen where his great tent had stood, cavorting on hands and feet like an enormous dog-baboon, searching every inch of the ground for anything we might have left. We three stood and watched him for half an hour, sweating with fear lest he chance on the place where his diary lay buried in the tin box. We began to wish we had brought it with us. I said we had done foolishly to leave it, although I had approved of Fred's burying it at the time.\n\n\"Suppose,\" I argued, \"he sets the natives of that village to searching! What's to prevent him? You know the kind of job they'd make of it--blade by blade of grass--pebble by pebble. Where they found a trace of loosened dirt they'd dig.\"\n\n\"Did you bury something, then?\" inquired a voice we knew too well. \"By the ace of stinks, those natives can smell out anything a white man ever touched!\"\n\nWe turned and faced Coutlass, whom we had imagined on ahead with the safari. If he noticed our sour looks, he saw fit to ignore them; but he took an upperhanded, new, insolent way with us, no doubt due to our refusal to shoot Schillingschen. He ascribed that to a yellow streak.\n\n\"I was right. Gassharamminy! I could have sworn I saw two of you on watch while the third man dug among the stones! What did you bury? I came back to talk about Brown. The poor drunkard wants to head more to the east. I say straight on. What do you say?\"\n\nWe told him to go forward. Then we looked in one another's eyes, and said nothing. Whether or not the original decision had been wise, there was no question now what was the proper course.\n\nInstead of tiring out Schillingschen we made an early camp by a watercourse, and built a very big protection for the donkeys against lions--a high thorn enclosure, and an outer one not so high, with a space between them wide enough for the two tents and half a dozen big fires. Before dark we had enough fuel stacked up to keep the fires blazing well all night long.\n\nNeither Coutlass nor Brown had had a drink of whisky that day, so it was all the more remarkable that Coutlass lay down early in a corner of the tent and fell into a sound sleep almost at once. We were thoroughly glad of it. Our plan was for two of us to creep out of camp when it was dark enough, and recover the contents of that tin box before Schillingschen or the blacks could forestall us.\n\nThe lions began roaring again at about sundown, but they love donkey-meat more than almost any except giraffe, and it was not likely they would trouble us. We were so sure the task was not particularly risky that Fred, who would have insisted on the place of greater danger for himself, consented willingly enough to stay in camp while Will and I went back. Our original intention was to take Schillingschen's patent, wind-proof, non-upsettable camp lantern to find the way with and keep wild beasts at bay; but just as Will went toward the tent to fetch it (Fred's back was turned, over on the far side where he was seeing to the camp-fires) we both at once caught sight of Coutlass creeping on hands and knees along a shadow. We had closed the gap in the outer wall of thorn, but he dragged aside enough to make an opening and slipped through, thinking himself unobserved.\n\nTo have followed him with a lantern would have been worse than my crime of stalking lions in the dark. Will ran to tell Fred what had happened while I followed the Greek through the gap, and presently Will and I were both hot on his trail, as close to him as we could keep without letting him hear us.\n\n\"Fred says,\" Will whispered, \"if we catch him talking with Schillingschen, shoot 'em both! Fred won't let him into camp again unless we bring back proof he's not a traitor!\"\n\nWe were pursuing a practised hunter, who at first kept stopping to make sure he was not followed. He took a line across that wild country in the dark with such assurance, and so swiftly that it was unbelievably hard to follow him quietly. It was not long before we lost sound of him. Then we ran more freely, trusting to luck as much as anything to keep him thinking he had the darkness to himself."
